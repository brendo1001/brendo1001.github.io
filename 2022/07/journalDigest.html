<h3 id="how-can-pedology-and-soil-classification-contribute-towards-sustainable-development-as-a-data-source-and-information-carrier">How can pedology and soil classification contribute towards sustainable development as a data source and information carrier?</h3>

<p>Soil classification is based on both the properties of the soil material and the pedogenetic pathways responsible for those properties. Because soil properties are linked to soil function and potential, information on soil classification has formed the basis for empirical interpretations of mapping units in terms of limitations or suit abilities for a wide range of land uses. In this way, a soil type acts as an accessible “carrier of information” presenting “the story of..”. Though valuable for broad land-use assessments, these empirical interpretations of soil functionality are inadequate to answer modern interdisciplinary questions focused on sustainable development. Four case studies are presented showing various quantitative approaches focusing on soil functions contributing to ecosystem services in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the European Green Deal, demonstrating that: (i) the use of soil surveys and associated databases feeding soil-water-atmosphere-plant simulation models can contribute to defining soil functions and ecosystem services; (ii) hydropedological characterization of soil types can allow a strong reduction in the number of landscape units to be considered, improving practical applicability; (iii) pedotransfer functions can successfully link soil data to modeling parameters; (iv) functionality requires expression of soil management effects on properties of a given soil type, to be expressed by phenoforms; (v) only models can be applied to explore important future effects of climate change by running IPCC scenarios; and (vi) the most effective level of soil classification-acting as carriers of information when defining soil functionality-will differ depending on the spatial scale being considered, whether local, regional or higher.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-prediction-methods-for-interpreting-complex-models-of-soil-variation">Beyond prediction: methods for interpreting complex models of soil variation</h3>

<p>Understanding the spatial variation of soil properties is central to many sub-disciplines of soil science. Commonly in soil mapping studies, a soil map is constructed through prediction by a statistical or non-statistical model calibrated with measured values of the soil property and environmental covariates of which maps are available. In recent years, the field has gradually shifted attention towards more complex statistical and algorithmic tools from the field of machine learning. These models are particularly useful for their predictive capabilities and are often more accurate than classical models, but they lack interpretability and their functioning cannot be readily visualized. There is a need to understand how these models can be used for purposes other than making accurate prediction and whether it is possible to extract information on the relationships among variables found by the models. In this paper we describe and evaluate a set of methods for the interpretation of complex models of soil variation. An overview is presented of how model-independent methods can serve the purpose of interpreting and visualizing different aspects of the model. We illustrate the methods with the interpretation of two mapping models in a case study mapping topsoil organic carbon in France. We reveal the importance of each driver of soil variation, their interaction, as well as the functional form of the association between environmental covariate and the soil property. Interpretation is also conducted locally for an area and two spatial locations with distinct land use and climate. We show that in all cases important insights can be obtained, both into the overall model functioning and into the decision made by the model for a prediction at a location. This underpins the importance of going beyond accurate prediction in soil mapping studies. Interpretation of mapping models reveal how the predictions are made and can help us formulating hypotheses on the underlying soil processes and mechanisms driving soil variation.</p>

<h3 id="high-resolution-field-measurement-of-soil-heat-capacity-and-changes-in-soil-moisture-using-a-dual-probe-heat-pulse-distributed-temperature-sensing-approach">High-Resolution Field Measurement of Soil Heat Capacity and Changes in Soil Moisture Using a Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse Distributed Temperature Sensing Approach</h3>

<p>Increasing interest in studying the variability of soil water content and its spatial scale dependency necessitates the development of new techniques to accurately monitor soil water over a wide range of spatial scales. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to measure temperature with a spatial resolution of a few centimeters over several kilometers, which can be used to measure soil moisture. This study is the first of its kind that investigates under field conditions the feasibility of combining the Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse (DPHP) technique with the DTS technology to measure soil thermal properties and variation in soil moisture. A field experiment was conducted over a 30 m transect in the Lake Wheeler Field laboratory in Raleigh, NC. Three different DPHP sensors were constructed from combinations of different fiber optic cables and heating elements and were tested to assess their performance and the effect of their construction characteristics on their accuracy. Measurements were taken over different soil moisture conditions and the system performance was compared against independent soil water content sensors. The system was able to track changes in soil water content with a mean RMSE of 0.02 m(3) m(-3) using the optimal DPHP sensor. The key advantage of the tested system is that it does not need any site-specific calibrations typically required for other DTS-based systems. The findings of this study provide some practical information and measures that need to be taken for successful DTS-DPHP construction and application under field conditions.</p>

<h3 id="local-scale-optimization-of-geomorphometric-land-surface-parameters-using-scale-standardized-gaussian-scale-space">Local scale optimization of geomorphometric land surface parameters using scale-standardized Gaussian scale-space</h3>

<p>It is long recognized that the processes that define the shape of the landscape operate at specific scales, and that mismatch between the scale of analysis and the scale of the process leads to erroneous results. A priori knowledge is often used in specific applications when appropriate scales are known; otherwise selecting an optimal scale of analysis has proven much more challenging. Existing attempts to address scale optimization treat scale as a spatially stationary parameter, and often rely on the generation and analysis of large volumes of data. This research introduces a method to represent topographically complex information at locally optimized scales. A constant time Gaussian scale-space implementation is used to manipulate topographic structure prior to the computation of local derivatives, followed by scale-standardization to facilitate cross-scale comparison. The method demonstrates how Gaussian smoothing can be used to efficiently explore the scaling characteristics of many topographic metrics, and how scale-standardization facilitates the identification of characteristic scales. The spatial distributions of the optimal scale and both the measured value and scale-standardized value measured at the optimal scale provide new information with which to characterize topography. These data improve topographic characterization while eliminating the redundancy of homogenous scale representation.</p>

<h3 id="when-do-cover-crops-reduce-nitrate-leaching-a-global-meta-analysis">When do cover crops reduce nitrate leaching? A global meta-analysis</h3>

<p>The global increases in the surface and groundwater nitrate (NO3-) concentrations due to synthetic fertilizer input have emerged as major sustainability threats to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Cover crops can reportedly reduce nitrate leaching from croplands. However, the underlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of cover crops in reducing nitrate leaching across species, soil types, agronomic management, and climates remain elusive. We conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of cover crops on nitrate leaching and water drainage. A random-effects analysis was established to investigate seven moderating variables in 41 articles. Results showed that globally, cover crops reduced nitrate leaching by 69% compared with fallow while demonstrating no effect on water drainage. Overall, cover crops from Brassicaceae and Poaceae families showed the greatest effect with 75% and 52% reduction in nitrate leaching, respectively. Cover cropping on Ultisols, Histosols, and Inceptisols resulted in the greatest reduction in nitrate leaching (77%, 78%, and 77%, respectively). Greater efficacy of cover crops at reducing nitrate leaching was evident with increasing soil sand content. In general, cover crops appeared to perform better to reduce nitrate leaching in vegetable systems compared to field crops. Cover cropping on conventional tillage resulted in a 63% reduction in nitrate leaching compared with no-tillage (50%) and reduced tillage (38%) systems. The impact of cover crops on water drainage was nonsignificant which implies that nitrate leaching control by cover crops is unlikely exerted through reducing water drainage. This study brings further insight into the intrinsic factors affecting cover crop efficacy and management practices that enhance cover crop potential in reducing nitrate leaching from agricultural systems.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-from-a-landmark-1991-article-on-soil-structure-distinct-precedence-of-non-destructive-assessment-and-benefits-of-fresh-perspectives-in-soil-research">Lessons from a landmark 1991 article on soil structure: distinct precedence of non-destructive assessment and benefits of fresh perspectives in soil research</h3>

<p>In 1991, at the launch of a national symposium devoted to soil structure, the Australian Society of Soil Science invited Professor John Letey to deliver a keynote address, which was later published in the society’s journal. In his lecture, he shared the outcome of his reflexion about what the assessment of soil structure should amount to, in order to produce useful insight into the functioning of soils. His viewpoint was that the focus should be put on the openings present in the structure, rather than on the chunks of material resulting from its mechanical dismantlement. In the present article, we provide some historical background for Letey’s analysis, and try to explain why it took a number of years for the paradigm shift that he advocated to begin to occur. Over the last decade, his perspective that soil structure needs to be characterised via nondestructive methods appears to have gained significant momentum, which is likely to increase further in the near future, as we take advantage of recent technological advances. Other valuable lessons that one can derive from Letey’s pioneering article relate to the extreme value for everyone, even neophytes, to constantly ask questions about where research on given topics is heading, what its goals are, and whether the methods that are used at a certain time are optimal.</p>

<h3 id="development-of-a-crop-water-use-monitoring-system-using-electromagnetic-induction-survey">Development of a crop water use monitoring system using electromagnetic induction survey</h3>

<p>Monitoring soil water use at the plot level is essential for studying the plant’s response to drought or irrigation. However, the current soil monitoring system using moisture sensors is impractical. Soil electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys can be a rapid, convenient, and non-invasive solution for monitoring soil moisture changes at the plot level. This study developed a crop water use monitoring system for the plot level using an EMI instrument that collects measurements at 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 cm above the ground surface. The EMI data were converted to bulk soil electrical conductivity (sigma) to the depth 1.5 m via an inversion technique and correlated with measured volumetric moisture contents. The EMI system was first tested for variation in ambient temperature. Within the temperature range of 25.5-34 degrees C, the standard deviation varied between 0.84 and 3.45 mS m-1 with coefficient of variations 1.54-9.26%. The system was then tested on a field trial at Narrabri, New South Wales, Australia, to measure the water use of chickpea genotypes grown over a season. The total water use of chickpeas obtained from EMI surveys correlated highly with values obtained from the Neutron Moisture Meter (NMM) (R2 = 0.73). Time-series of water content, as measured by the EMI survey, could differentiate the water use of different genotypes. In conclusion, the EMI survey is an efficient technique for monitoring crop water use.</p>
