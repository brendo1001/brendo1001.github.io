<h3 id="the-benefits-and-trade-offs-of-agricultural-diversity-for-food-security-in-low-and-middle-income-countries-a-review-of-existing-knowledge-and-evidence">The benefits and trade-offs of agricultural diversity for food security in low-and middle-income countries: A review of existing knowledge and evidence</h3>

<p>Diversity in agricultural systems is often presented as having benefits for multiple purposes like food and nutrition security in low- and middle-income countries. Our review aims to give an overview of the strength and direction of the diversity-food security relationship as presented in research published since 2010, based on a comprehensive search in Web of Science. We present an overview and synthesize results for different spatial scales and units of observation, from individual to global and for the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, stability and utilisation. Eighty-eight of the 924 surveyed publications meet the inclusion criteria and report the direction and magnitude of 314 individual diversity-food security relationships. In almost two thirds of all cases, agricultural diversity had a positive effect on food security. In about one third of the relationships there was no effect of agricultural diversity on food security, or the results were mixed. These numbers hold for the availability, access and utilisation dimensions of food security and at individual, household and farm scales, but the number of studies was too small to draw robust conclusions on the stability dimension and at global scale. Diversity can be an important driver of food security, but the magnitude of the contribution depends on the broader socio-economic and biophysical characteristics of the local farming system. We conclude that diversification can be a potential strategy to improve food and nutrition security. Yet, it is not a necessary characteristic of all agricultural systems at all costs especially in the presence of other strategies that can potentially achieve similar outcomes. We make several recommendations to strengthen future studies that can help identify how strongly related agricultural diversity and food security are.</p>

<h3 id="rigorous-empirical-and-quantitative-a-proposed-pipeline-for-soil-health-assessments">Rigorous, empirical, and quantitative: a proposed pipeline for soil health assessments</h3>

<p>Soil health is a promising lens through which to approach land management, having the potential to serve as a descriptor of biophysical processes and as an effective communication tool across stakeholders. However, this potential has been largely unrealized due to difficulty in quantitatively assessing soil health and linking those assessments to outcomes. Here we discuss many multiple persistent obstacles to quantitative soil health assessment and outline a suite of analyses to help address those obstacles. Specifically, we propose a quantitative approach to developing and selecting soil health indicators that help connect management-induced changes in soil health to specific outcomes (e.g., yield or water quality). To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we perform a small case study using published data from North Carolina and New York cropping systems. Additionally, we outline how this approach is scalable and flexible enough to integrate future soil health metric development. The proposed approach stands to provide a quantitative, empirical basis for future measurement, assessment, and interpretation of soil health.</p>

<h3 id="diffuse-reflectance-spectroscopy-characterises-the-functional-chemistry-of-soil-organic-carbon-in-agricultural-soils">Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy characterises the functional chemistry of soil organic carbon in agricultural soils</h3>

<p>Soil organic carbon (SOC) originates from a complex mixture of organic materials, and to better understand its role in soil functions, one must characterise its chemical composition. However, current methods, such as solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, are time-consuming and expensive. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the visible, near infrared and mid-infrared regions (vis-NIR: 350-2500 nm; mid-IR: 4000-400 cm(-1)) can also be used to characterise SOC chemistry; however, it is difficult to know the frequencies where the information occurs. Thus, we correlated the C functional groups from the C-13 NMR to the frequencies in the vis-NIR and mid-IR spectra using two methods: (1) 2-dimensional correlations of C-13 NMR spectra and the diffuse reflectance spectra, and (2) modelling the NMR functional C groups with the reflectance spectra using support vector machines (SVM) (validated using 5 times repeated 10-fold cross-validation). For the study, we used 99 mineral soils from the agricultural regions of Sweden. The results show clear correlations between organic functional C groups measured with NMR and specific frequencies in the vis-NIR and mid-IR spectra. While the 2D correlations showed general relationships (mainly related to the total SOC content), analysing the importance of the wavelengths in the SVM models revealed more detail. Generally, models using mid-IR spectra produced slightly better estimates than the vis-NIR. The best estimates were for the alkyl C group (R-2 = 0.83 and 0.85, vis-NIR and mid-IR, respectively), and the O/N-alkyl C group was the most difficult to estimate (R-2 = 0.34 and 0.38, vis-NIR and mid-IR, respectively). Combining C-13 NMR with the cost-effective diffuse reflectance methods could potentially increase the number of measured samples and improve the spatial and temporal characterisation of SOC. However, more studies with a wider range of soil types and land management systems are needed to further evaluate the conditions under which these methods could be used. Highlights Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to characterise and model SOC functional chemistry. NMR derived C functional groups could be modelled with vis-NIR and mid-IR diffuse reflectance spectra. The methods allow for characterisation of SOC chemical composition on whole mineral soil samples. The approach can improve the spatial and temporal characterisation of SOC composition.</p>

<h3 id="discrete-element-modeling-of-aggregate-shape-and-internal-structure-effects-on-weibull-distribution-of-tensile-strength">Discrete element modeling of aggregate shape and internal structure effects on Weibull distribution of tensile strength</h3>

<p>Many soil processes and functions, including carbon storage, water and element cycling, and crop productivity, are directly or indirectly affected by soil aggregates. As a key property, aggregate tensile strength is usually quantified by the Weibull distribution. This distribution was found to depend on soil texture, organic matter content, and aggregate shape; however, effects of cementing agents (i.e., clay mineral and organic compounds) on aggregate tensile strength cannot be empirically studied independent of shape. The objective was to apply Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) to simulate the rupture of soil aggregates of different shapes but the same assumed distributions of cementing agents. The hypothesis was that the Weibull modulus of aggregate tensile strength could be used to describe the heterogeneity of the particle binding forces within the aggregate. Multiple DEM simulations of aggregate rupture were carried out for sets of randomly generated binding force distributions between particles of the same diameter. Aggregate properties and shapes were obtained from those observed in arable Gleyic Cambisol topsoil from plots with and without vegetation of a soil compaction trial; additional aggregate shapes were simulated to increase the predictive range. The simulation results showed that (i) the sensitivity of Weibull modulus of aggregate tensile strength to the heterogeneity of particle binding force distribution increased with aggregate sphericity, (ii) the value of the Weibull modulus decreased with increasing heterogeneity of this distribution, and (iii) internal heterogeneity also reduced the crack surface area produced by aggregate rupture. Results corresponded to friability theory implying that small values of Weibull modulus indicated more complex soil structural organization. The DEM simulations could help explaining complex interactions between aggregate shape cementing agents and stability. Our DEM approach also uncovered the importance of Weibull modulus to assess structural features of soil aggregates and to describe the heterogeneity of the particle binding forces within the aggregate.</p>

<h3 id="capacity-and-intensity-indicators-to-evaluate-the-effect-of-different-crop-sequences-and-cover-crops-on-soil-physical-quality-of-two-different-textured-soils-from-pampas-region">Capacity and Intensity Indicators to evaluate the effect of different crop sequences and cover crops on soil physical quality of two different textured soils from Pampas Region</h3>

<p>Soil physical degradation is a current problem in Molisols of the Pampas Region under no-tillage (NT), that has been related to over-simplified agricultural systems with scarce or no rotations and long winter bare fallows. Soil physical quality (SPQ) is a key factor of soil health and productivity, as it controls root development and air and water fluxes and storage in the soil, which in turn affect nutrient uptake and plant growth. Cover crops have been proposed as a companion agricultural practice to improve NT performance and SPQ. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of winter cover crops in different cropping sequences on capacity and intensity indicators of SPQ in two soils of different texture under NT and to compare it with different traditional crop sequences, including non-agricultural plots. SPQ was evaluated at two different sites, one with a silty loam Argiudoll and the other with a sandy loam Hapludoll. Treatments included plots with and without cover crops, with different summer crop sequences (continuous soybean and corn - soybean rotations). Also, a corn - wheat/soybean rotation with and without pastures was evaluated. All treatments had more than 15 years under the same management. We measured soil organic carbon (SOC), and capacity SPQ indicators (bulk density, total porosity, pore size distribution, air capacity, plant available water, relative field capacity and S index). We also measured dynamic SPQ indicators derived from field infiltration tests (saturated and near saturation hydraulic conductivity, effective macro and mesoporosity, and porosity connectivity indexes for different pore families). On the silty loam Argiudoll, cover crops increased SOC but failed to improve SPQ. This was related to soil physical degradation and the low ability of these soils for structure regeneration. On the sandy loam Hapludoll, cover crops had mixed effects on SOC and pore size distribution, but increased near saturation hydraulic conductivity, in the case of the corn - soybean rotation with cover crops, reaching values similar to those of a natural grassland.</p>

<h3 id="fusion-of-visible-to-near-infrared-and-mid-infrared-spectroscopy-to-estimate-soil-organic-carbon">Fusion of visible-to-near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy to estimate soil organic carbon</h3>

<p>Spectral techniques such as visible-to-near-infrared (VIS-NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopies have been regarded as effective alternatives to laboratory-based methods for determining soil organic carbon (SOC). Research to explore the potential of the fusion of VIS-NIR and MIR absorbance for improving SOC prediction is needed, since each individual spectral range may not contain sufficient information to yield reasonable estimation accuracy. Here, we investigated two data fusion strategies that differed in input data, including direct concatenation of full-spectral absorbance and concatenation of selected predictors by optimal band combination (OBC) algorithm. Specifically, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was adopted to optimize the spectral data before and after data fusion. Prediction models for SOC were developed using partial least squares regression. Results demonstrated that estimations for SOC using MIR absorbance (i.e., validation R-2 = 0.45-0.64) generally outperformed those using VIS-NIR (i.e., validation R-2 = 0.20-0.44). Compared to the raw absorbance counterparts, CWT decomposing could improve the prediction accuracy for SOC, for both the individual absorbance and the fusion of VIS-NIR and MIR absorbance. Among all the models investigated, the combinational use of VIS-NIR and MIR using OBC fusion at CWT scale of 1 yielded the optimal prediction, providing the highest validation R-2 of 0.66. This model with 10 selected spectral parameters as input is of small total data volume, large processing speed and efficiency, confirming the potential of OBC in fusing both types of spectral data. In summary, CWT decomposing and OBC strategy are powerful algorithms in analyzing the spectral data, and allow the VIS-NIR and MIR spectral fusion models to improve the SOC estimation.</p>

<h3 id="soil-water-characteristic-curves-and-their-estimated-hydraulic-parameters-in-no-tilled-and-conventionally-tilled-soils">Soil-water characteristic curves and their estimated hydraulic parameters in no-tilled and conventionally tilled soils</h3>

<p>Tillage loosens soil, reduces bulk density, alters soil structure and pore size distribution, consequently affecting the shape of the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) and related hydraulic properties and parameters in the top layer of soil. Knowledge of SWRC and hydraulic properties are needed for many soil, agronomic, irrigation, hydrological and environmental studies. This work compares the effect of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) practices on SWRCs and their estimated parameters at 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depths based on soil samples collected in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Undisturbed soil cores were extracted using stainless steel cylinders (8 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height) from 0 to 15 cm and 15-30 cm depths in planted corn rows. Soil core sampling was replicated five times in a randomized block design. Soil cores were saturated prior to measurement by the capillarity method and SWRC were measured using the HYPROP evaporative method. Measured soil-water retention curve data were fitted for no-tilled and tilled soils using the van Genuchten (vG) equation for each depth. Results indicated that differences existed in SWRC properties and estimated parameters of vG equation between the two tillage management practices. Averaged across 4 years and two depths, the SWRC parameters alpha, n, and theta(s) were significantly greater under CT than under NT, however, theta(r) was not affected by tillage. The higher alpha, n, and theta(s) values in CT were likely associated with greater soil loosening and disturbance induced by CT operations, thereby forming greater macroporosity and pore volume that, in turn, caused a decrease in bulk density in CT compared to NT. Regardless of the tillage method, SWRCs enable growers and researchers to select farming and irrigation management practices that improve water use efficiency, sustain crop productivity and maintain environmental quality.</p>
