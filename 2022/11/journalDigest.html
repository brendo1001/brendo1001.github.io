<h3 id="the-dutch-soil-physical-units-map-bofek">The Dutch soil physical units map: BOFEK</h3>

<p>Soils and their properties play an important role in land evaluation studies. Often such studies focus on larger scales ranging from watersheds up to the national scale or even larger. Soil properties are often known at smaller scales, sometimes at the level of individual soil samples. The aim of this study is to show how point information on soil hydraulic properties, i.e., water retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics, can be upscaled via soil textural classes to a soil physical units map of a region or nation. Base information is the Dutch soil map (1:50,000) and the hydraulic properties of individual soil samples. All individual soil samples for which hy-draulic properties were measured were divided based on their texture into eighteen top-soils and eighteen sub-soils. For each of these thirty-six groups geometric average water retention and hydraulic conductivity charac-teristics were derived. In total 368 derived soil profiles are distinguished in the Dutch soil map consisting of soil layers that are linked to the thirty-six texture groups. For each soil profile eight static hydraulic properties were calculated. The soil profiles were then clustered based on these properties into seventy-nine clusters or units, which then make up a soil physical units map for the Netherlands. It has been demonstrated that dynamically simulated transpiration reduction for the clustered situation is similar to obtained for all individual soil profiles. At the Dutch national scale, the difference in simulated transpiration reduction between runs using all 368 soil profiles or the 79 soil physical units was less than 2.5 % percentage-points in 96 % of all plots or less than 5 % percentage-points in 99 % of all plots. Similar good correspondence was obtained for other water balance terms as well, including actual transpiration, actual evaporation at the soil surface, degree of saturation at 15 and 30 cm depth, the integrated water flux at 100 cm depth and surface runoff.</p>

<h3 id="remote-sensing-of-land-change-a-multifaceted-perspective">Remote sensing of land change: A multifaceted perspective</h3>

<p>The discipline of land change science has been evolving rapidly in the past decades. Remote sensing played a major role in one of the essential components of land change science, which includes observation, monitoring, and characterization of land change. In this paper, we proposed a new framework of the multifaceted view of land change through the lens of remote sensing and recommended five facets of land change including change location, time, target, metric, and agent. We also evaluated the impacts of spatial, spectral, temporal, angular, and data-integration domains of the remotely sensed data on observing, monitoring, and characterization of different facets of land change, as well as discussed some of the current land change products. We recommend clarifying the specific land change facet being studied in remote sensing of land change, reporting multiple or all facets of land change in remote sensing products, shifting the focus from land cover change to specific change metric and agent, integrating social science data and multi-sensor datasets for a deeper and fuller understanding of land change, and recognizing limitations and weaknesses of remote sensing in land change studies.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-geological-reports-based-on-knowledge-graphs-using-a-deep-learning-approach">Understanding geological reports based on knowledge graphs using a deep learning approach</h3>

<p>Geological reports aid in understanding exploration by providing valuable information on rock formation , evolution and the geological environment in which deposits formed. Querying and extracting the critical information from these enormous historical geological report data helps in understanding the exploration risks in different geological settings. However, large amounts of unstructured text data occur in geological reports; therefore, it is challenging to obtain valuable information from them without performing information extraction and processing. This study proposed an automated method for extracting information from geological reports through triple extraction, then automatically constructs a geological knowledge graph from the extracted entities and relations. Simultaneously, due to the lack of samples, this study used multiple geological reports to construct a corpus of jointly extracted geological entities and relations. The proposed model reached an F1-score of 90.05% in the experimental results on the constructed corpus. Finally, a knowledge graph was constructed based on the extracted results to demonstrate the application value of the proposed method. The results showed that the structured information helps better represent the content of the source report and matches well with the geological domain knowledge. The proposed method can quickly and robustly convert textual data into a structured form that is convenient for reasoning and querying geological entities and relations.</p>

<h3 id="the-probability-based-granular-field-of-vegetated-soils">The probability-based granular field of vegetated soils</h3>

<p>Soils in vegetation-covered areas are of high variability in space and time, and the variability is crucial for hydro-geophysical processes at small and large scales. Conventionally, the spatial heterogeneity at large scale is visualized as a regional division map of soil properties by extrapolating sample measurements. No formalized method is available for assigning parameters for soils at the resolution of a small grid cell. This study formulates a method of establishing parameter space for vegetated soil by a single index (mu) derived from the unified grain size distribution (GSD). The index mu varies in space as a random variable and defines soil as a granular field. The mu-division represents the concentration of fine grains in response to root-soil interactions. Coupling mu-division with moisture distribution suggests that the gradient of mu plays a potential role in rooted soil hydraulics. It is further found that mu satisfies the Weibull distribution, which makes it possible to establish the mu-field for a soil space at large scale using the random dataset of mu. A case study is conducted in two vegetated slopes based on high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) derived from unmanned aerial vehicle survey to create the field and illustrate its implications in morphology and hydrology. It is expected that the mu-field may derive parameter fields of various soil properties as functions of the GSD parameters and thus equip DEM with a complete dataset of soil. The paradigm proposed in the study fills the gap of establishing high-resolution data space for soil at large scale for dynamics of surface processes.</p>

<h3 id="factors-controlling-soc-stability-in-colluvial-soils-under-contrasting-climate-and-soil-weathering-conditions">Factors controlling SOC stability in colluvial soils under contrasting climate and soil weathering conditions</h3>

<p>Although agricultural colluvial soils are important storage for soil organic carbon (SOC), the mechanisms underlying colluvial (cumulative soils) SOC stability have received little attention so far. In this study, we aim to understand to what extent the main controls on colluvial SOC stability differ from those observed in non-colluvial soils. Paired soil profiles (non-colluvial versus colluvial) were collected from five sites which differ in climate, soil geochemical background and cultivation history. Topsoil (0-10 cm) and subsoil (30-50 cm) were analysed for SOC fractions, mineral composition, potential soil respiration and radiocarbon content. Our analysis showed that for non-colluvial soils, climate, cultivation history and weathering degree have significant effects on potential soil respiration. In contrast, for colluvial soils, the most influential factor for potential soil respiration was the rate of accretion and this was independent of climatic and geochemical context. Furthermore, accretion rates indirectly affected potential soil respiration by interacting with the degree of weathering of deposited soil. This changed the mineral matrix of colluvial soil settings and thereby may enhance soil mineral-related SOC stabilisation mechanisms. Together, these results suggest that the dominant controls on SOC stability in colluvial soils differ from those in non-colluvial soils, and the soil accretion rate is the most important control on colluvial SOC stability in agricultural systems. Highlights The dominant controls on SOC stability in colluvial and non-colluvial soils were compared. Climate and mineral weathering predominantly control SOC stability in non-colluvial soils. In contrast, the accretion rate is the key factor controlling colluvial SOC stability. Accretion rate drives the role of mineral weathering in colluvial SOC stability.</p>

<h3 id="the-dynamic-changes-of-soil-air-filled-porosity-associated-with-soil-shrinkage-in-a-vertisol">The dynamic changes of soil air-filled porosity associated with soil shrinkage in a Vertisol</h3>

<p>Soil aeration is critical for crop growth, which is generally assessed by air-filled porosity (AFP). In non-rigid soils with high shrinkage and swelling, the AFP is not only related to the total porosity and soil moisture, but also to the soil shrinkage behaviour. However, the relationship between AFP and soil shrinkage has not been clarified. The objectives of this study were to (1) establish a mathematical equation to describe the behaviours of AFP associated with soil shrinkage (AFP(sh)); and (2) to evaluate the influence of tillage practice on the AFP(sh). Undisturbed soil core samples were collected from the 0-10 cm to 10-20 cm layers in a Vertisol under four tillage treatments (No tillage, NT; Rotary tillage, RT; Subsoiling, SS; Deep ploughing, DP) to measure the changes in the volumes of soil core, soil water and air at different soil matric potentials. Our results showed that an equation of AFP(sh) as a function of moisture ratio (&amp; thetasym;) was well established based on the developed soil shrinkage model (R-2 &gt; 0.990, RMSE &lt;0.012). Compared with the AFP under a constant pore assumption (AFP(c)), the AFP(sh) was significantly decreased by 10.6% to 60.3% as soil water matric potentials were at &lt;-33 kPa in the 0-10 cm layer or at &lt;-10 kPa in the 10-20 cm layer (p &lt; 0.05). According to the AFP(sh) curve of the Vertisol, soil moisture content (theta) was approximately 68%-80% of the field capacity when AFP(sh) reached non-limiting status (0.10 cm(3) cm(-3)), where the soil matric potential was close to the wilting point (-1500 kPa). Deep tillage treatment (SS and DP) increased AFP(sh), showing good performance in decreasing the risk of soil aeration deficit relative to the NT and RT treatment. Our results demonstrate that neglecting the porosity variations during shrinkage may lead to a high bias in the AFP prediction. Highlights An equation of AFP associated with soil shrinkage was established. AFP was significantly decreased when soil shrinkage was considered for a Vertisol. The Vertisol was easily subjected to both water and air stress due to soil shrinkage. Deep tillage practises improved soil aeration in the Vertisol.</p>
