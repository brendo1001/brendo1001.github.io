My research specializations are pedometrics, chemometrics and digital soil mapping and assessment research. My main research objective is to seek out a definitive understanding of the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil so that we can be better custodians of them now and for generations to come. This driving motivation has seen me contribute significantly to the methodological development and delivery of comprehensive soil information systems. Most of my work basically seeks out new and innovative ways and inferences systems for soil measurement in all its dimensions, and designing systems that leverage both new and legacy soil and environmental data to facilitate nuanced decision making for optimal management of natural resources.  

## Pedometrics
-----
Pedometrics is a branch of soil science. The Pedometrics research community includes soil and environmental scientists, who are primarily interested in the use of statistical and mathematical tools to analyze and interpret soil data. I have been lucky enough to have work alongside one of the key persons involved in the establishment of Pedometrics. It has been said that Prof. Alex McBratney coined the term. In any case the [history of Pedometrics](http://pedometrics.org/?page_id=7) is well documented. Importantly, Pedometrics is probably one of the most active sol science research communities. Pedometrics has a number of working groups that i engage. These include: digital soil mapping, proximal soil sensing and digital soil morphometrics.

## Digital Soil Mapping
-----

Digital soil mapping (DSM) means the creation and population of spatial soil information systems by numerical models inferring the spatial and temporal variations of soil types and soil properties from soil observation and knowledge from related environmental variables [Lagacherie and McBratney 2006](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016624810631001X). The concepts and methodologies for DSM were formalized in a review by [McBratney et al. (2003)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706103002234). In the McBratney et al. (2003) paper, the *scorpan* approach for predictive modelling (and mapping) of soil was introduced, which in itself is rooted in earlier works by [Jenny (1941)](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Factors_of_soil_formation.html?id=h-dIAAAAMAAJ). *scorpan* is a mnemonic for factors for prediction of soil attributes: soil, climate, organisms, relief, parent materials, age, and spatial position. The scorpan approach is formulated by the equation:

$$
      S = f(s,c,o,r,p,a,n) + \epsilon\
$$


This equation states that the soil type or attribute at an unvisited site can be predicted from a numerical function or model (*f*) given the factors just described plus the locally varying, spatial dependent residuals $\epsilon$. The scorpan factors or environmental covariates come in the form of spatially populated digitally available data. For example from digital elevation models and the indices derived from them: slope, aspect, MRVBF etc. Landsat data, and other remote sensing images, radiometric data, geological survey maps, legacy soil maps and related data,just to name a few. 


### Topics

I think there are a number of interesting research topics that can be explored in DSM. It is an interesting exercise just learning how to create a digital map. There is something special about using real data, coupled with model-based methods and GIS that makes DSM so interesting and enlightening

* There are always new GIS tools becoming available that make DSM more efficient for researchers. This could be new software, interactive visualizations, online sharing mechanisms etc. DSM always needs to stay abreast of these developments.

* There are always new and improved sources of environmental data that could be of benefit to to DSM. 

* Methods of pre-processing soil data for DSM. Harmonizing soil profile data, detecting outliers, soil data visualizations, soil data summaries.

* Optimized sampling strategies that more efficient and less burdensome to implement.

* There are always new models being developed that could potentially be applicable for either continuous and categorical soil variables. There is particular interest in non-linear models or models that are not purely statistical models, but soil data models. The emphasis here is soil and not pure statistics.

* Methods for quantifying soil map uncertainty. We know that maps are not error free. We need innovative ways of making this important task more efficient.

* Methods for Assessing the quality of digital soil maps. How reliable are the maps we are making? How can we measure this?

* Methods for updating, harmonizing and disaggregating legacy soil mapping. 

* Methods for generating digital sol maps in situations of very sparse data.

* Methods for ensemble spatial modelling of soil attributes. 

* Methods for multiscale DSM. Can we resolve global or national extent mapping for field or farm applications? Is there a scale continuum for DSM? 

* Creating maps to the specifications of the end-user irrespective of the original data.

Some of the topics listed above are considered in the [Using R for Digital Soil Mapping Book](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319443256). This book provides an entry point to going about DSM. It is largely focused on the doing, rather than the theory and semantics. You will also learn how to go about things using the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) scripting language too.
