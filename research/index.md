My research specializations are pedometrics, chemometrics and digital soil mapping and assessment research. My main research objective is to seek out a definitive understanding of the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil so that we can be better custodians of them now and for generations to come. This driving motivation has seen me contribute significantly to the methodological development and delivery of comprehensive soil information systems. Most of my work basically seeks out new and innovative ways and inferences systems for soil measurement in all its dimensions, and designing systems that leverage both new and legacy, soil and environmental data to facilitate nuanced decision making for optimal management of natural resources.
