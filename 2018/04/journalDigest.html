<p>Abstract:
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas and the main driver of
stratospheric ozone depletion. Since soils are the largest source of
N2O, predicting soil response to changes in climate or land use is
central to understanding and managing N2O. Here we find that N2O flux
can be predicted by models incorporating soil nitrate concentration
(NO3-), water content and temperature using a global field survey of N2O
emissions and potential driving factors across a wide range of organic
soils. N2O emissions increase with NO3- and follow a bell-shaped
distribution with water content. Combining the two functions explains
72% of N2O emission from all organic soils. Above 5 mg NO3–N kg(-1),
either draining wet soils or irrigating well-drained soils increases N2O
emission by orders of magnitude. As soil temperature together with NO3-
explains 69% of N2O emission, tropical wetlands should be a priority for
N2O management.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Agrominerals are finely ground rocks and minerals used as low-cost
fertilisers, and they have received more attention in recent years as
sustainable development and climate change mitigation have come to the
forefront of societal concerns. Here, we summarise progress in
agromineral research over the last 20 years, and discuss the challenges
and opportunities of this discipline. The idea of agrominerals has been
around since the early 19th century. However, widespread application is
subject to economic practicality. In recent years, two big trends have
dominated agromineral research. First, some global warming mitigation
strategies, such as ‘enhanced chemical weathering’ and bio-energy carbon
capture and storage call for the application of rock powders in arable
land on a massive scale. This gives agromineral research an urgency and
significance. Second, advances in knowledge of mineral weathering
kinetics are poised to transform predictions of agronomic effectiveness
from mere empirical studies to more quantitative evaluation. We now have
a much better understanding of the factors that influence weathering and
nutrient release rates. We forecast that rapid advances in some areas of
biogeochemistry will enable advances in the study of agrominerals. In
particular, we will be able to measure weathering and nutrient release
rates at the field scale, and ultimately to predict kinetic processes of
mineral dissolution or precipitation in soil-water-plant systems and the
cycling of nutrients and toxic elements in agricultural land.</p>

<p>Abstract:
The terms Internet of Things and Big Data are currently subject to much
attention, though the specific impact of these terms in our practical
lives are difficult to apprehend. Data-driven approaches do lead to new
possibilities, and significant improvements within a broad range of
domains can be achieved through a cloud-based infrastructure. In the
agricultural sector, data-driven precision agriculture shows great
potential in facilitating the increase in food production demanded by
the increasing world population. However, the adoption rate of precision
agriculture technology has been slow, and information and communications
technology needed to promote the implementation of precision agriculture
is limited by proprietary integrations and non-standardized data formats
and connections. In this paper, an open geospatial data infrastructure
is presented, based on standards defined by the Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC). The emphasis in the design was on improved
interoperability, with the capability of using sensors, performing cloud
processing, carrying out regional statistics, and provide seamless
connectivity to machine terminals. The infrastructure was implemented
through open source software, and was complemented by open data from
governmental offices along with ESA satellite imagery. Four use cases
are presented, covering analysis of nearly 50 000 crop fields and
providing seamless interaction with an emulated machine terminal. They
act to showcase both for how the infrastructure enables modularity and
interoperability, and for the new possibilities which arise from this
new approach to data within the agricultural domain.</p>

Topaj, A; Mirschel, W</p>

<em>COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE</em>, 145 199-207; FEB 2018</p>

<p>Abstract:
An abnormal non-monotonic shape of production function(response of
obtained yield to increasing rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizers) has
been observed in experimental field trials. Often, the observed
effect(an inflection point, or intermediate plateau or even local
undershoot of the “yield-fertilization” curve) is treated as a test
distortion and will be ignored or sorted out. This article presents the
authors’ efforts to interpret and to explain similar phenomenon by means
of investigating two mechanistic crop simulation models AGROSIM and
AGROTOOL. It is demonstrated that an imitation model can be used as a
valuable tool of scientific research, allowing for the hypothesising of
alternative understandings of non-trivial natural phenomena.</p>

<em>COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE</em>, 145 311-318; FEB 2018</p>

<p>Abstract:
In this paper, convolutional neural network models were developed to
perform plant disease detection and diagnosis using simple leaves images
of healthy and diseased plants, through deep learning methodologies.
Training of the models was performed with the use of an open database of
87,848 images, containing 25 different plants in a set of 58 distinct
classes of [plant, disease] combinations, including healthy plants.
Several model architectures were trained, with the best performance
reaching a 99.53% success rate in identifying the corresponding [plant,
disease] combination (or healthy plant). The significantly high success
rate makes the model a very useful advisory or early warning tool, and
an approach that could be further expanded to support an integrated
plant disease identification system to operate in real cultivation
conditions.</p>

<em>EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE</em>, 69 (1):10-20; JAN 2018</p>

<p>Abstract:
This review examines the interactions between soil physical factors and
the biological processes responsible for the production and consumption
in soils of greenhouse gases. The release of CO2 by aerobic respiration
is a non-linear function of temperature over a wide range of soil water
contents, but becomes a function of water content as a soil dries out.
Some of the reported variation in the temperature response may be
attributable simply to measurement procedures. Lowering the water table
in organic soils by drainage increases the release of soil carbon as CO2
in some but not all environments, and reduces the quantity of CH4
emitted to the atmosphere. Ebullition and diffusion through the
aerenchyma of rice and plants in natural wetlands both contribute
substantially to the emission of CH4; the proportion of the emissions
taking place by each pathway varies seasonally. Aerated soils are a sink
for atmospheric CH4, through microbial oxidation. The main control on
oxidation rate is gas diffusivity, and the temperature response is
small. Nitrous oxide is the third greenhouse gas produced in soils,
together with NO, a precursor of tropospheric ozone (a short-lived
greenhouse gas). Emission of N2O increases markedly with increasing
temperature, and this is attributed to increases in the anaerobic volume
fraction, brought about by an increased respiratory sink for O-2.
Increases in water-filled pore space also result in increased anaerobic
volume; again, the outcome is an exponential increase in N2O emission.
The review draws substantially on sources from beyond the normal range
of soil science literature, and is intended to promote integration of
ideas, not only between soil biology and soil physics, but also over a
wider range of interacting disciplines.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Soil has a considerable effect on human health, whether those effects
are positive or negative, direct or indirect. Soil is an important
source of nutrients in our food supply and medicines such as
antibiotics. However, nutrient imbalances and the presence of human
pathogens in the soil biological community can cause negative effects on
health. There are also many locations where various elements or chemical
compounds are found in soil at toxic levels because of either natural
conditions or anthropogenic activities. The soils of urban environments
have received increased attention in the last few years, and they too
pose a number of human health questions and challenges. Concepts such as
soil security may provide a framework within which issues on soil and
human health can be investigated using interdisciplinary and
transdisciplinary approaches. It will take the contributions of experts
in several different scientific, medical and social science fields to
address fully soil and human health issues. Although much progress was
made in understanding links between soil and human health over the last
century, there is still much that we do not know about the complex
interactions between them. Therefore, there is still a considerable need
for research in this important area.HighlightsSoil is important to human
health.Effects can be positive or negative, direct or indirect.Advances

<em>REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT</em>, 205 1-17; FEB 2018</p>

<p>Abstract:
Soil information with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial to
assess potential soil degradation and to achieve sustainable
productivity and ultimately food security. The spatial resolution of
existing soil maps can commonly be too coarse to account for local soil
variations and owing to the cost and resource needs required to update
information these maps lack temporal information. With improved
computational processing capabilities, increased data storage and most
recently, the increasing amount of freely available data (e.g. Landsat,
Sentinel-2A/B), remote sensing imagery can be integrated into existing
soil mapping approaches to increase temporal and spatial resolution of
soil information. Satellite multi-temporal data allows for generating
cloud free, radiometrically and phenologically consistent pixel based
image composites of regional scale. Such data sets are of particular use
for extracting soil information in areas of intermediate climate where
soils are rarely exposed. The Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP)
is a new approach designed to make use of per-pixel compositing to
overcome the issue of limited soil exposure. The objective of this paper
is to demonstrate the automated processors ability to handle large image
databases to build multispectral reflectance composite base data layers
that can support large scale top soil analyses. The functionality of the
SCMaP is demonstrated using Landsat imagery over Germany from 1984 to
2014 applied over 5 year periods. Three primary product levels are
generated that will allow for a long term assessment and distribution of
soils that include the distribution of exposed soils, a statistical
information related to soil use and intensity and the generation of
exposed soil reflectance image composites. The resulting composite maps
provide useful value-added information on soils with the exposed soil
reflectance composites showing high spatial coverage that correlate well
with existing soil maps and the underlying geological structural
regions.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing typically involves a
scanning antenna that makes measurements at irregularly spaced
locations. These locations can change on a day to day basis. Soil
moisture products derived from satellite-based passive microwave remote
sensing are usually resampled to a fixed Earth grid that facilitates
their use in applications. In many cases the grid size is finer than the
actual spatial resolution of the observation, and often this difference
is not well understood by the user. Here, this issue was examined for
the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced version of the
passive-based soil moisture product, which has a grid size of 9-km and a
nominal spatial resolution of 33-km. In situ observations from core
validation sites were used to compute comparison metrics. For sites that
satisfied the established reliability and scaling criteria, the impact
of validating the 9-km grid product with in situ data collected over a
9-km versus a 33-km domain was very small for the sites studied (0.039
m(3)/m(3) unbiased root mean square difference for the 9-km case versus
0.037 m(3)/m(3) for the 33-km case). This result does not mean that the
resolution of the product is 9-km but that for the conditions studied
here the soil moisture estimated from in situ observations over 9-km is
a close approximation of the soil moisture estimated from in situ
observations over the 33-km resolution. The implication is that using
the enhanced SMAP product at its grid resolution of 9-km should not
introduce large errors in most applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Hyperspectral data, with their detailed spectral information at
different wavelengths, offer multiple ways to assess biodiversity. One
approach, known as the “spectral variation hypothesis” (SVH), proposes
that biodiversity is linked to spectral diversity. However, SVH-based
approaches, which we refer to as “spectral diversity metrics”, can be
confounded by soil exposure and are sensitive to the spatial resolution
of the data. To address these issues, we 1) investigated the impact of
soil exposure on spectral diversity, 2) identified optimal bands for
mapping biodiversity using a spectral diversity metric based on
dimension reduction, and 3) assessed the impact of spatial resolution on
spectral diversity metrics. In this study; alpha-diversity (species
richness) was used as a measure of plant biodiversity. The study was
based on two imaging spectrometry data sets from the Cedar Creek
Ecosystem Science Reserve in Central Minnesota, USA, at two levels:
proximal and airborne. The data sets included varying degrees of soil
background sampled at two different spatial resolutions (1 mm and 0.75
m). We explored five spectral diversity metrics, including the
coefficient of variation, convex hull volume, spectral angle mapper,
spectral information divergence, and a newly proposed dimension
reduction-based metric called “convex hull area.” For the proximal data
set (pixel size of 1 mm), filtering soil pixels by applying a normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold improved the performance of
all spectral diversity metrics significantly, with the coefficient of
variation showing the highest correlation with species richness. In the
airborne data set (pixel size of 0.75 m), the convex hull area
outperformed other metrics. These findings demonstrate promising
approaches for remote sensing of biodiversity, illustrate a confounding
effect of soil background on remote diversity measurement, and indicate
that the most informative regions of the electromagnetic spectrum for
estimating species richness can vary with spatial scale.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Reliable representations of global urban extent remain limited,
hindering scientific progress across a range of disciplines that study
functionality of sustainable cities. We present an efficient and
low-cost machine-learning approach for pixel-based image classification
of built-up areas at a large geographic scale using Landsat data. Our
methodology combines nighttime-lights data and Landsat 8 and overcomes
the lack of extensive ground reference data. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methodology, which is implemented in Google Earth
Engine, through the development of accurate 30 m resolution maps that
characterize built-up land cover in three geographically diverse
countries: India, Mexico, and the US. Our approach highlights the
usefulness of data fusion techniques for studying the built environment
and is a first step towards the creation of an accurate global-scale map
of urban land cover over time.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Land cover mapping via image classification is sometimes realized
through object-based image analysis. Objects are typically constructed
by partitioning imagery into spatially contiguous groups of pixels
through image segmentation and used as the basic spatial unit of
analysis. As it is typically desirable to know the accuracy with which
the objects have been delimited prior to undertaking the classification,
numerous methods have been used for accuracy assessment. This paper
reviews the state-of-the-art of image segmentation accuracy assessment
in land cover mapping applications. First the literature published in
three major remote sensing journals during 2014-2015 is reviewed to
provide an overview of the field. This revealed that qualitative
assessment based on visual interpretation was a widely-used method, but
a range of quantitative approaches is available. In particular, the
empirical discrepancy or supervised methods that use reference data for
assessment are thoroughly reviewed as they were the most frequently used
approach in the literature surveyed. Supervised methods are grouped into
two main categories, geometric and non-geometric, and are translated
here to a common notation which enables them to be coherently and
unambiguously described. Some key considerations on method selection for
land cover mapping applications are provided, and some research needs
are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Models can serve as temporal interpolators for landscape reconstruction,
and geostatistical interpolation can assist in obtaining full-cover
maps. Both activities are associated with uncertainty. We applied a
hydrological model (MODFLOW), a soil development model (SoilGen) and
regression kriging to reconstruct a Middle Bronze Age landscape. This
reconstruction comprises maps of a set of land characteristics and is
input for a land evaluation meant to explain low occupancy during this
period. The land evaluation showed marginal suitability in 81% of the
area for Bronze Age land utilization types, which explains the low
occupancy. We evaluated the effects of model accuracy and interpolation
accuracy on the uncertainty of the land evaluation, assuming no
uncertainty about the land evaluation protocol. The effect of model
(in)accuracy was assessed by generating 100 perturbations using a
variance-covariance error matrix filled using independent measurements
from 1953 CE. The effect of spatial interpolation errors was assessed by
generating 100 realizations of the land characteristics by Sequential
Gaussian Simulation. Results show that uncertainty contributions of the
model errors and interpolation errors are similar in terms of entropy H’
between land evaluation maps (fairly low H’ of 0.47 and 0.38 for model
and interpolation error respectively). Model-reconstructed land
characteristics led to fairly reliable land evaluations. Priority
improvements for the model were identified and ranked. Most improvements
come at high computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Assessments of soils by reflectance spectroscopy have potential to
facilitate and optimize soil survey, classification, and mapping of
large areas. Visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectra have been
moderately used in pedological studies regarding characterization of
soil samples and profiles, weathering and pedogenetic alterations along
toposequences and landscapes, and soil classification. Therefore, there
still is a lack of information about vis-NIR spectral pedology. For soil
samples, our aims were to characterize the effects of physical,
chemical, and mineralogical properties on vis-NIR soil spectral
behavior, and to evaluate its potentiality in clustering 1259 soil
samples according to weathering levels. For soil profiles, our aims were
to evaluate the influence of pedogenesis in spectral behavior of some
typical Brazilian soil classes, and to discriminate them by integrating
proximal sensing and distance metrics. Continuum removed spectral data
were transformed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Fuzzy
K-means algorithm and taxonomic distance were applied to cluster soil
samples and profiles, respectively. Differences in reflectance intensity
and absorption features caused by weathering intensification enabled to
distinguish soil samples regarding similarity of particle size
distribution, mineralogy, and some chemical properties. Soil formation
processes, in particular, lessivage, dessilication, and ferralization
similarly affected the spectral behavior soil profiles considering
changes in depth caused by redistribution of soil properties by
horizons. A coherent discrimination of soil profiles was possible by
combining spectral data and pedological distance metrics where 30% of
the soil classes could be individually clustered as follow: Ferralsol,
Nitisol, Acrisol, Lixisol, Arenosol, Gleysol, Cambisol, and Leptsol.
vis-NIR spectral data enabled a coherent grouping of Ferralsol profiles
with different contents of clay and iron oxides. vis-NIR reflectance
spectroscopy is presented here as a useful and reliable tool for direct
applications in pedological assessments, in particular, soil survey and
classification.</p>

<p>Abstract:
The complexity of processes and interactions that drive soil C dynamics
necessitate the use of proxy variables to represent soil characteristics
that cannot be directly measured (correlative proxies), or that
aggregate information about multiple soil characteristics into one
variable (integrative proxies). These proxies have proven useful for
understanding the soil C cycle, which is highly variable in both space
and time, and are now being used to make predictions of the fate and
persistence of C under future climate scenarios. However, the C pools
and processes that proxies represent must be thoughtfully considered in
order to minimize uncertainties in empirical understanding. This is
necessary to capture the full value of a proxy in model parameters and
in model outcomes. Here, we provide specific examples of proxy variables
that could improve decision-making, and modeling skill, while also
encouraging continued work on their mechanistic underpinnings. We
explore the use of three common soil proxies used to study soil C
cycling: metabolic quotient, clay content, and physical fractionation.
We also consider how emerging data types, such as genome-sequence data,
can serve as proxies for microbial community activities. By examining
some broad assumptions in soil C cycling with the proxies already in
use, we can develop new hypotheses and specify criteria for new and
needed proxies.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Climate change impact assessments are plagued with uncertainties from
many sources, such as climate projections or the inadequacies in
structure and parameters of the impact model. Previous studies tried to
account for the uncertainty from one or two of these. Here, we developed
a triple-ensemble probabilistic assessment using seven crop models,
multiple sets of model parameters and eight contrasting climate
projections together to comprehensively account for uncertainties from
these three important sources. We demonstrated the approach in assessing
climate change impact on barley growth and yield at Jokioinen, Finland
in the Boreal climatic zone and Lleida, Spain in the Mediterranean
climatic zone, for the 2050s. We further quantified and compared the
contribution of crop model structure, crop model parameters and climate
projections to the total variance of ensemble output using Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA). Based on the triple-ensemble probabilistic assessment,
the median of simulated yield change was -4% and +16%, and the
probability of decreasing yield was 63% and 31% in the 2050s, at
Jokioinen and Lleida, respectively, relative to 1981-2010. The
contribution of crop model structure to the total variance of ensemble
output was larger than that from downscaled climate projections and
model parameters. The relative contribution of crop model parameters and
downscaled climate projections to the total variance of ensemble output
varied greatly among the seven crop models and between the two sites.
The contribution of downscaled climate projections was on average larger
than that of crop model parameters. This information on the uncertainty
from different sources can be quite useful for model users to decide
where to put the most effort when preparing or choosing models or
parameters for impact analyses. We concluded that the triple-ensemble
probabilistic approach that accounts for the uncertainties from multiple
important sources provide more comprehensive information for quantifying
uncertainties in climate change impact assessments as compared to the
conventional approaches that are deterministic or only account for the
uncertainties from one or two of the uncertainty sources.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Soil erodibility represents the soil’s response to rainfall and run-off
erosivity and is related to soil properties such as organic matter
content, texture, structure, permeability and aggregate stability. Soil
erodibility is an important factor in soil erosion modelling, such as
the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), in which it is
represented by the soil erodibility factor (K-factor). However,
determination of soil erodibility at larger spatial scales is often
problematic because of the lack of spatial data on soil properties and
field measurements for model validation. Recently, a major national
project has resulted in the release of digital soil maps (DSMs) for a
wide range of key soil properties over the entire Australian continent
at approximately 90-m spatial resolution. In the present study we used
the DSMs and New South Wales (NSW) Soil and Land Information System to
map and validate soil erodibility for soil depths up to 100 cm. We
assessed eight empirical methods or existing maps on erodibility
estimation and produced a harmonised high-resolution soil erodibility
map for the entire state of NSW with improvements based on studies in
NSW. The modelled erodibility values were compared with those from field
measurements at soil plots for NSW soils and revealed good agreement.
The erodibility map shows similar patterns as that of the parent
material lithology classes, but no obvious trend with any single soil
property. Most of the modelled erodibility values range from 0.02 to
0.07 t ha h ha(-1) MJ(-1) mm(-1) with a mean (+/- s.d.) of 0.035 +/-
0.007 t ha h ha(-1) MJ(-1) mm(-1). The validated K-factor map was
further used along with other RUSLE factors to assess soil loss across
NSW for preventing and managing soil erosion.</p>

<h3 id="linking-land-use-capability-classes-and-apsim-to-estimate-pasture-growth-for-regional-land-use-planning">Linking Land Use Capability classes and APSIM to estimate pasture growth for regional land use planning</h3>

<p>Abstract
Investigation of land-use and management changes at regional scales require the linkage of farm-system models with land-resource information, which for pastoral systems includes forage supply. The New Zealand Land Resource Inventory (NZLRI) and associated Land Use Capability (LUC) database include estimates of the potential stock-carrying capacity across the country, which can be used to derive estimates of average annual pasture yields. Farm system models and decision support tools, however, require information on the seasonal patterns of pasture growth. To generate such pasture growth curves (PGCs), the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used, with generic soil profiles based on descriptions of LUC classes, to generate PGCs for three regions of New Zealand. Simulated annual pasture yields were similar to the estimates of annual potential pasture yield in the NZLRI spatial database, and they provided information on inter-annual variability. Simulated PGCs generally agreed well with measured long-term patterns of seasonal pasture growth. The approach can be used to obtain spatially discrete estimates of seasonal pasture growth patterns across New Zealand for use in farm system models and for assessing the impact of management practices and climate change on the regional sustainability.</p>
