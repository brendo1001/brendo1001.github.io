<h3 id="assessing-alteration-of-soil-quality-degradation-and-resistance-indices-under-different-land-uses-through-network-and-factor-analysis">Assessing alteration of soil quality, degradation, and resistance indices under different land uses through network and factor analysis</h3>

<p>Over-increasing population and their needs necessitate sustainable use of soil and the other natural resources. In these circumstances land use changes may occur for supplying the food and settlement requirements of the increased population. Therefore, it is needed to evaluate and monitor quality and degradation of the soils. Recently, identification of appropriate soil quality (SQI) and degradation (SDI) indices for assessing sustainable use of soil resources has received increased attention. However, evaluation of quality, degradation, and resistance indices through various new approaches (e.g., network, NA and factor, FA analysis) particularly under different land uses to determine their susceptibility have been rarely conducted. The present study aimed to i) determine SQI, SDI, and resistance (SRI) indices NA and FA approaches under different land uses; ii) investigate the most influential attributes to soil quality (SQ); and iii) to compare SQIs obtained using two different Integrated (IQI) and Nemoro (NQI) Quality Indices, and indicator selection (Minimum Data Set, MDS and Total Data Set, TDS) approaches. Composite soil samples of cropland, forestland, and rangeland were collected and twentyone soil physicochemical and fertility indicators were measured. MDS was determined using principal component analysis (PCA). The SDI and SRI were computed and compared. Results revealed that the SDI was -13.8% and -4.6% for the cropland and rangeland, respectively indicating inappropriate soil managerial practices in cropland. SRI was 0.01 and 0.41 for the cropland and rangeland, respectively. The lowest SRI values were obtained for critical level of organic matter (CLOM), organic matter (OM), zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) showing that these properties, compared with the others, are more sensitive to land use change. Regression equations between SDI and SRI revealed that these substantial relationships show similar trends indicating that these are useful indices to determine SQ and evaluate the effect of land use change and managerial practices. Soils in cropland had a significantly lower deterioration index (DI) (-66.70) than that of the other land uses. SQI in the cropland was the lowest, especially when screened with the NA method. Furthermore, SQI showed the highest correlation with clay and CLOM. The linear SQI value derived from correlation-based-NA method showed greater max/min ratios than that of the FA. Therefore, the NA-based-SQI, as a novel statistical approach, would be more effective than the SQI-derived-FA for evaluating the effects of land use changes and managerial practices. In general, the mentioned technique is a relatively comprehensive approach integrating different influential soil indicators with various weights showing their contributions to soil quality or degradation process.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-soil-moisture-interface-of-multi-depth-change-over-time">Interactive soil moisture interface of multi-depth change over time</h3>

<p>Estimation of soil moisture throughout a crop root zone (nowcasting) is prone to spatial error, even when the time variable (forecasting) is removed. Measurement at discrete points in the field is now common using multi -depth sensors reporting at high temporal resolution, e.g.; every 15 or 60 min. The agricultural industry standard for data representation is suitable for prescriptive applications such as irrigation scheduling but is inadequate for descriptive applications such as reviewing change through a rainfed growing season. We developed an inter-active interface for animating past data and tested it on 61 EnviroPro (R) capacitance probes for up to 24 months starting mid 2019. Probes were installed in grey vertisol cropping soils of northern NSW, Australia, which contract when dry to produce deep cracks. When static, the interface highlights change in moisture at each level to the present date, with a default value of seven days. The interface shows these values against historical ex-tremes for the installation duration. When animated, the interface enables exploration of soil moisture change over one or more seasons by depth and crop phenology. We believe this descriptive use of data improves un-derstanding of crop-water relations, particularly for dryland crop production systems where management de-cisions are reliant on longer-term projections.</p>

<h3 id="land-use-legacy-footprint-in-mediterranean-forest-soils-an-infrared-spectroscopy-approach">Land use legacy footprint in Mediterranean forest soils: An infrared spectroscopy approach</h3>

<p>Chemical properties of forest soils can strongly influence this compartment vulnerability to climate change ef-fects. Past human activities can play a major role in structuring soil chemical properties. In the Mediterranean region, abandonment of terrace agriculture since 1860 induced the coexistence of forests with different ages. Here, soil chemical signature (SCS) was compared between very recent, recent and ancient forests using Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy and other chemical properties (total C and N, CaCO3 percentages). Land Use Legacy (LUL) effects were analysed depending on soil depths and on contrasted climate conditions (humid vs subhumid Mediterranean climates). Statistic treatments, Linear Mixed-Effect and Anova COMmon DIMension models, were used to highlight the influence of depth’s soil, climate and LUL effects. Interestingly, the soil depth did not influence LUL effect on soil spectra. The effect of climate, LUL and their interactions were observed on the SCS. Higher available N was observed in soils from ancient forests than in soils from very recent forests. Moreover, mineral fraction discriminated soils with different LUL (very recent vs recent and ancient forests) and this depended on climate. Under subhumid climate, soils from very recent forests were indeed negatively correlated with the mineral fraction, while under humid climate, they were positively correlated to it. Finally, a recovery of soils chemical properties was observed in recent forests under humid climate, while under subhumid climate, SCS of post agricultural forests was different from that of ancient forests.</p>

<p>Reliable manipulation of soil organic matter (SOM) - a necessity for optimal land management - is constrained by our limited mechanistic understanding of SOM formation. Here we propose a novel mechanistic element that may contribute to SOM dynamics, supplementing existing frameworks, based on evolutionary-ecological rather than chemical or physical limitations to decomposition. We argue that decomposition of some substrates may be constrained by spatial competition from opportunists. We describe and test a mathematical model based on our framework, providing a proof-of-concept that substrate can, in principle, be spared decomposition and accumulate even when it is physically and chemically accessible. Our framework can help explain a variety of SOM dynamics, including priming and the suppression of decomposition by nitrogen addition, as well as the typical composition of SOM. An augmented mechanistic framework for understanding SOM dynamics can help guide targeted empirical study, which in turn can contribute to more optimised land management.</p>

<h3 id="knowledge-is-power-where-digital-soil-mapping-needs-geopedology">Knowledge Is Power: Where Digital Soil Mapping Needs Geopedology</h3>

<p>Much of current digital soil mapping (DSM) practice relies on terrain, climate and remote sensing-derived covariates. These are easy to obtain and can serve as proxies to soil forming factors and from these to soil properties or classes. However, mapping of soil bodies, not properties in isolation, is what gives insight into the soil landscape. A naïve attempt at correlating environmental covariates will not succeed in the presence of unmapped variations in parent material, soil bodies and landforms inherited from past environments. It also takes no account of spatial relations among soil bodies. Geopedology integrates an understanding of the geomorphic conditions under which soils evolve with field observations. Examples where simplistic DSM would fail but geopedology would succeed in mapping and, even better, explaining the soil distribution are shown: exhumed paleosols, low-relief depositional environments, inverted landscapes, and recent post-glacial landscapes.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-soil-structure-affect-water-infiltration-a-meta-data-systematic-review">How does soil structure affect water infiltration? A meta-data systematic review</h3>

<p>Soil structure is a key attribute of soil quality and health that significantly impacts water infiltration. Structure can be significantly altered by natural or anthropogenic drivers including soil management practices and can in turn impact soil infiltration. Those changes in soil structure are often complex to quantify and can lead to conflicting impacts on water infiltration into soils. Here, we present a narrative systematic review (SR) of the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as defined methods for literature search and data extraction, our systematic review led to a total of 153 papers divided into two sets: experimental (131) and theoretical (22) papers. That implied a significant number of in-situ and field experiments that were conducted to assess the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration under the influence of different land uses and soil practices. Analysis of the metadata extracted from the collected papers revealed significant impacts of soil structure on water infiltration. Those effects were further attributed to land use and management, where we demonstrate the impact of three unique categories: soil amendments, crop management and tillage. Furthermore, significant correlations were established between infiltration rate and soil structural properties, with R2 values ranging from 0.51 to 0.80 and for saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil structural properties, with R2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.78. Finally, our review highlighted the significant absence of and the need for theoretical frameworks studying the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration.</p>

<h3 id="multi-modelling-predictions-show-high-uncertainty-of-required-carbon-input-changes-to-reach-a-4-parts-per-thousand-target">Multi-modelling predictions show high uncertainty of required carbon input changes to reach a 4 parts per thousand target</h3>

<p>Soils store vast amounts of carbon (C) on land, and increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in already managed soils such as croplands may be one way to remove C from the atmosphere, thereby limiting subsequent warming. The main objective of this study was to estimate the amount of additional C input needed to annually increase SOC stocks by 4%(0) at 16 long-term agricultural experiments in Europe, including exogenous organic matter (EOM) additions. We used an ensemble of six SOC models and ran them under two configurations: (1) with default parametrization and (2) with parameters calibrated site-by-site to fit the evolution of SOC stocks in the control treatments (without EOM). We compared model simulations and analysed the factors generating variability across models. The calibrated ensemble was able to reproduce the SOC stock evolution in the unfertilised control treatments. We found that, on average, the experimental sites needed an additional 1.5 +/- 1.2 Mg C ha(-)(1) year(-1) to increase SOC stocks by 4%(0) per year over 30 years, compared to the C input in the control treatments (multi-model median +/- median standard deviation across sites). That is, a 119% increase compared to the control. While mean annual temperature, initial SOC stocks and initial C input had a significant effect on the variability of the predicted C input in the default configuration (i.e., the relative standard deviation of the predicted C input from the mean), only water-related variables (i.e., mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) explained the divergence between models when calibrated. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks in agriculture and accentuates the need to increasingly lean on multi-model ensembles when predicting SOC stock trends and related processes. To increase the reliability of SOC models under future climate change, we suggest model developers to better constrain the effect of water-related variables on SOC decomposition.</p>

<h3 id="applications-of-computed-tomography-ct-in-environmental-soil-and-plant-sciences">Applications of Computed Tomography (CT) in environmental soil and plant sciences</h3>

<p>Computed tomography (CT) in combination with advanced image processing can be used to non-invasively and non-destructively visualize complex interiors of living and non-living media in 2 and 3-dimensional space. In addition to medical applications, CT has also been widely used in soil and plant science for visual and quanti-tative descriptions of physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes. The technique has been used successfully on numerous applications. However, with a rapidly evolving CT technologies and expanding ap-plications, a renewed review is desirable. Only a few attempts have been made to collate and review examples of CT applications involving the integrated field of soil and plant research in recent years. Therefore, the objectives of this work were to: (1) briefly introduce the basic principles of CT and image processing; (2) identify the research status and hot spots of CT using bibliometric analysis based on Web of Science literature over the past three decades; (3) provide an overall review of CT applications in soil science for measuring soil properties (e.g., porous soil structure, soil components, soil biology, heat transfer, water flow, and solute transport); and (4) give an overview of applications of CT in plant science to detect morphological structures, plant material properties, and root-soil interaction. Moreover, the limitations of CT and image processing are discussed and future per-spectives are given.</p>
