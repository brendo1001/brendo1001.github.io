<h3 id="fifty-years-after-deep-ploughing-effects-on-yield-roots-nutrient-stocks-and-soil-structure">Fifty years after deep-ploughing: Effects on yield, roots, nutrient stocks and soil structure</h3>

<p>Deep-ploughing far beyond the common depth of 30 cm was used more than 50 years ago in Northern Germany with the aim to break root-restricting layers and thereby improve access to subsoil water and nutrient resources. We hypothesized that effects of this earlier intervention on soil properties and yields prevailed after 50 years. Hence, we sampled two sandy soils and one silty soil (Cambisols and a Luvisol) of which half of the field had been deep-ploughed 50 years ago (soils then re-classified as Treposols). The adjacent other half was not deep-ploughed and thus served as the control. At all the three sites, both deep-ploughed and control parts were then conventionally managed over the last 50 years. We assessed yields during the dry year 2019 and additionally in 2020, and rooting intensity at the year of sampling (2019), as well as changes in soil structure, carbon and nutrient stocks in that year. We found that deep-ploughing improved yields in the dry spell of 2019 at the sandy sites, which was supported by a more general pattern of higher NDVI indices in deep-ploughed parts for the period from 2016 to 2021 across varying weather conditions. Subsoil stocks of soil organic carbon and total plant-available phosphorus were enhanced by 21%–199% in the different sites. Root biomass in the subsoil was reduced due to deep-ploughing at the silty site and was increased or unaffected at the sandy sites. Overall, the effects of deep-ploughing were site-specific, with reduced bulk density in the buried topsoil stripes in the subsoil of the sandy sites, but with elevated subsoil density in the silty site. Hence, even 50 years after deep-ploughing, changes in soil properties are still detectable, although effect size differed among sites.</p>

<h3 id="a-global-indicator-of-soil-macroinvertebrate-community-composition-abundance-and-diversity">A global indicator of soil macroinvertebrate community composition, abundance and diversity</h3>

<p>Macroinvertebrate communities are highly sensitive indicators of physical and chemical soil qualities. Their evaluation in field conditions is rather simple and could serve as proxy for soil-based ecosystem services that farmers and field technicians could use. We tested the hypothesis that an indicator of soil macroinvertebrate communities, with 14 taxonomic groups characterized at the order level, could be used in any region of the world to assess these communities. A synthetic indicator was calculated using data from 9 reference sites from tropical, subtropical and temperate regions, a set of 3694 data of the open access Macrofauna database and a new site for validation. Invertebrates were extracted with the standard ISO/TSBF methodology and characterized with a set of 14 large taxonomic units, plus an index of taxonomic richness and total density. At each of the 9 reference sites, 27 to 252 sample points, representing different types of plant covers and/or soil management options, were considered and compared with their respective local synthetic GISQ indicator values. These indicators, elaborated from Principal Component Analysis of the sample points data, are set to vary from 0.1 to 1.0 according to the composition, diversity and abundance of the community. Analyses showed great similarities among sites, with Factors 1 (from 21.9 to 36.9 % variance explained) expressing the overall abundance and diversity of the communities and Factors 2 (8.9 to 15.83 %) opposing sites with dominant soil ecosystem engineer populations (Earthworms, Ants, Termites and some Coleoptera) to sites dominated by litter transformer populations (Diplopoda, Isopoda and others). Indicator formulae were designed based on PCA analyses of each data set and a global formula was established with the Macrofauna database. Very high correlations (&gt;0.95) were obtained among values calculated with local data set and the general formula calculated with data of the Macrofauna database, in 8 of 9 sites and in the validation site. We discuss the importance of having a single formula to transform data obtained with a simple standard field method in the building of public policies for soil-based ecosystem services payment.</p>

<h3 id="optimising-poxc-effective-sensitivity-as-a-soil-indicator-in-australian-soils">Optimising POXC effective sensitivity as a soil indicator in Australian soils</h3>

<p>The continuum of soil organic carbon is currently not well represented by any single metric. Permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) has been widely utilized as a soil condition indicator due to its correlation with biological indicators and sensitivity to management effects over relatively short time periods. However, the ability of POXC to represent the continuum of soil organic carbon, and how this could improve the characterization of management effects, has not been sufficiently explored. This study investigated the relationship between permanganate concentration and POXC across nine permanganate concentrations ranging from 3 to 300 mM. An initial investigation was performed on ten cropped and uncropped topsoil pairs representing a diverse range of soil types across New South Wales, Australia, and an additional 52 sites were investigated in a farm-scale study. POXC was observed to increase monotonically and non-linearly with increasing permanganate concentration. POXC characteristics were developed by fitting a logistic function to the observed data, which facilitated calculation of the area under the curve (POXCAUC) and the theoretical maximum POXC (POXCmax). The utility of the POXC characteristic was demonstrated with highly significant differences (p ≤ 0.002) observed in POXCAUC between cropped and uncropped sites. POXCAUC also displayed larger probability test statistics compared to any single permanganate concentration. The investigation also revealed that if a single concentration were to be utilized for australian soils, the 50 mM concentration was more effective at discerning land use effects in clayey (p = 0.000) and sandy (p = 0.049) sites compared to the widely adopted 20 mM concentration (p = 0.001; p = 0.312).</p>

<h3 id="diffuse-reflectance-mid-infrared-spectroscopy-is-viable-without-fine-milling">Diffuse reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy is viable without fine milling</h3>

<p>While diffuse reflectance Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (mid-DRIFTS) has been established as a viable low-cost surrogate for traditional soil analyses, the assumed need for fine milling of soil samples prior to analysis is constraining the commercial appeal of this technology. Here, we reevaluate this assumption using a set of 2380 soil samples collected across North American agricultural soils. Cross-validation indicated that the best preprocessing (standard normal variate) and model form (memory-based learning) resulted in very good and nearly identical predictions for the &lt;2 mm preparation and fine-milled preparation of these soils for total organic carbon (TOC), clay, sand, pH and bulk density (BD). Application of larger models built from the USDA NRCS mid-DRIFTS library also resulted in minimal performance differences between the two sample preps. Lower predictive performance of the existing library was attributed to less-than-perfect spectral representativeness of the library. Regardless of model form, there was very little variability between replicates of the &lt;2 mm prep, suggesting that the lack of fine milling did not lead to more heterogeneous subsamples. Additionally, there was no relationship between residual error and soil texture, implying these results should be robust across most soil types. Overall, in agreement with other recent findings, these results suggest that routine scanning of standard &lt;2 mm preparation does not degrade predictive performance of mid-DRIFTS-based inference systems. With good standard operating procedures including quality control and traditional analysis on a small percent of samples, mid-DRIFTS can become a routine tool in commercial soil laboratories.</p>

<h3 id="cropping-intensity-map-of-china-with-10-m-spatial-resolution-from-analyses-of-time-series-landsat-78-and-sentinel-2-images">Cropping intensity map of China with 10 m spatial resolution from analyses of time-series Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 images</h3>

<p>Cropping intensity maps at high spatial resolution play a crucial role in guiding agricultural policies and ensuring food security. So far, most of nationwide cropping intensity maps have been developed from satellite images at moderate or coarse resolutions. In this study, we first assembled and integrated time-series dataset with high spatial resolution, specifically Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery in 2017. We then used an object- and phenology-based algorithm and integrated images to create a 10-m resolution cropping intensity map over China. The map evaluation results revealed an overall accuracy of 96.68 ± 0.01 % and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90. In 2017, single cropping dominated the agricultural practices in China, with an approximate area of 1.189 × 106 km2 ± 7.90 × 103 km2, constituted 79.26 % of the entire cropland area. Simultaneously, double and triple cropping covered approximately 0.306 × 106 km2 ± 8.03 × 103 km2 and 5.00 × 103 ± 1.75 × 103 km2, corresponding to 20.41 % and 0.33 % of the entire cropland area, respectively. On average, the national multiple cropping index (MCI) was 1.21. The results in the study prove the reliability of the generated mapping products and high potential of the developed mapping framework (the algorithm and integrated datasets), which can be readily applied to quantify the interannual changes of cropping pattern on a nationwide level with a high spatial resolution.</p>

<h3 id="prediction-of-soil-organic-matter-by-kubelka-munk-based-airborne-hyperspectral-moisture-removal-model">Prediction of soil organic matter by Kubelka-Munk based airborne hyperspectral moisture removal model</h3>

<p>Obtaining high-precision soil organic matter (SOM) spatial distribution information is of great significance for applications such as precision agriculture. But in the current hyperspectral SOM inversion work, soil moisture greatly influences the representation of the sensitive information of SOM on the spectrum. Therefore, a Kubelka-Munk theory based spectral correction model for soil moisture removal is proposed to improve the spectral sensitivity of SOM. Firstly, the soil moisture content was obtained by the use of a Kubelka-Munk based physical soil moisture model and an unmixing method. Then, the spectral correction model for soil moisture removal was implemented based on the quantitative description of the Beer-Lambert law. The results show that the proposed spectral correction model for soil moisture removal can significantly enhance the expression of the sensitive spectral features of SOM, especially for the short-wave infrared range. After moisture removal, the imaging spectral data were used for inversion, using the sensitive band at 0.69 μm and a support vector machine regression (SVR) modeling method. The Kubelka-Munk moisture removal model for soil moisture removal can improve the accuracy of SOM inversion by at least 22% comparing with the 0.69 μm original spectral inversion model, with R2 of 0.42. Moreover, the proposed model can also improve the accuracy of SOM inversion by 19% for the SVR statistical regression method, with R2 of 0.69. Finally, the SOM distribution maps based on sensitive band model and SVR regression method were analyzed. Findings show that the two methods have high consistency, but the statistical method obtains better details of the SOM spatial distribution, due to its higher accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="reproducing-computational-processes-in-service-based-geo-simulation-experiments">Reproducing computational processes in service-based geo-simulation experiments</h3>

<p>Geo-simulation experiments (GSEs) are experiments allowing the simulation and exploration of Earth’s surface (such as hydrological, geomorphological, atmospheric, biological, and social processes and their interactions) with the usage of geo-analysis models (hereafter called ‘models’). Computational processes represent the steps in GSEs where researchers employ these models to analyze data by computer, encompassing a suite of actions carried out by researchers. These processes form the crux of GSEs, as GSEs are ultimately implemented through the execution of computational processes. Recent advancements in computer technology have facilitated sharing models online to promote resource accessibility and environmental dependency rebuilding, the lack of which are two fundamental barriers to reproduction. In particular, the trend of encapsulating models as web services online is gaining traction. While such service-oriented strategies aid in the reproduction of computational processes, they often ignore the association and interaction among researchers’ actions regarding the usage of sequential resources (model-service resources and data resources); documenting these actions can help clarify the exact order and details of resource usage. Inspired by these strategies, this study explores the organization of computational processes, which can be extracted with a collection of action nodes and related logical links (node-link ensembles). The action nodes are the abstraction of the interactions between participant entities and resource elements (i.e., model-service resource elements and data resource elements), while logical links represent the logical relationships between action nodes. In addition, the representation of actions, the formation of documentation, and the reimplementation of documentation are interconnected stages in this approach. Specifically, the accurate representation of actions facilitates the correct performance of these actions; therefore, the operation of actions can be documented in a standard way, which is crucial for the successful reproduction of computational processes based on standardized documentation. A prototype system is designed to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed approach. By employing this pragmatic approach, researchers can share their computational processes in a structured and open format, allowing peer scientists to re-execute operations with initial resources and reimplement the initial computational processes of GSEs via the open web.</p>

<h3 id="equalizing-urban-agriculture-access-in-glasgow-a-spatial-optimization-approach">Equalizing urban agriculture access in Glasgow: A spatial optimization approach</h3>

<p>Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, has long-term issues with inequalities in health and food security, as well as large areas of vacant and derelict land. Urban agriculture projects can increase access to fresh food, improve mental health and nutrition, and empower and bring communities together. We investigated the distribution of urban agriculture in Glasgow and found that the current configuration of urban agriculture projects is mostly located centrally in the city, covering 36 % of the total population (approximately 635,000) within 10-minute walking distance. We also found a positive correlation (r = 0.13, p = 0.0003) between the walking travel time to the nearest urban agriculture project and the food desert status. To increase urban agriculture access across the city, we used the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) model to optimally situate new urban agriculture projects on vacant and derelict land to maximize the covered population. We identified that a minimum of 15 new urban agriculture projects could increase the population coverage to 49 % and equalize the access disparity to a statistically non-significant level. This research shows that converting vacant and derelict land in Glasgow into urban agriculture projects could both help with the city’s problem of vacant and derelict land and bring many potential benefits to local communities.</p>
