<h3 id="estimating-nutrient-transport-associated-with-water-and-wind-erosion-across-new-south-wales-australia">Estimating nutrient transport associated with water and wind erosion across New South Wales, Australia</h3>

<p>Nutrient transported from soils to water bodies not only threatens agricultural productivity and food security but also causes the degradation of water quality and the environment in many parts of the world. However, nutrient transport through soil erosion is often ignored in nutrient cycle studies; there is little understanding of how much nutrient is lost through water and wind erosion. In this study, we attempted to assess soil nutrient transport due to both water and wind erosion and its spatial and temporal variability across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We estimated the mass fraction (%) of total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the eroded soil, and the total nutrient stock of the soil layer down to 200 cm using water and wind erosion models and digital soil mapping. The estimated average N, P and SOC stocks in NSW topsoils (0-5 cm) are 160, 43, and 2970 kg ha(-1) respectively. There are great variations in the transport of nutrients by erosion in space and time, ranging from near zero in the Western region to 395 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the North Coast region. The average total nutrient transport rate is about 2.4 % of the surface soil (0-5 cm) total stock in NSW due to both water and wind erosion. The total cost of nutrient transport is estimated at 4.2 billion Australian dollars for the entire state of NSW and 0.2 billion dollars from the cropping lands per year. The areas with the highest nutrient transport rates are the North Coast and Hunter regions due to the relatively high water erosion and nutrient content of the soils. On average, water erosion contributes up to 98 % of the total nutrient transport across the state as a whole, but wind erosion can contribute up to 12 % of the total transport in Spring (i.e., September). This study is the first attempt to investigate nutrient transport from both water and wind erosion in Australia. The methodology and findings contribute to the knowledge of nutrient transport due to erosion in broad nutrient cycle studies.</p>

<h3 id="soil-structural-vulnerability-critical-review-and-conceptual-development">Soil structural vulnerability: Critical review and conceptual development</h3>

<p>Soil structure affects a range of soil functions (e.g., water, air, heat, and nutrient transport) and ecosystem services (e.g., production, climate regulation). Agricultural intensification is a dominant factor in global soil structural degradation. Understanding the vulnerability of soils to structural degradation may be important to land use planning and identifying management practices that mitigate the risk of degradation. We review the current methods for assessing soil structural vulnerability and the influencing factors, focussing on soil compaction and aggregate breakdown as two key measures of structural degradation. Methods for assessing risk of soil structural degradation and management practices affecting the risk are also discussed. Critical research gaps are identified, including the lack of studies that demonstrate the link between soil structural vulnerability and loss of soil functions or ecosystem services. Our review of the literature identified that the terms suscepti-bility, vulnerability, and risk are often used interchangeably. We propose definitions that can be used to distinguish these terms. Soil properties (relatively static), soil wetness, and land use stress (e.g., climate and management practices) are progressively included in the assessments of soil structural susceptibility, vulnera-bility, and risk. Existing indicators for assessing soil structural vulnerability may not be suitable to predict po-tential effects on ecosystem services. We highlight that soil structural vulnerability assessments should focus on key soil structural indicators (e.g., pore network-based hydraulic properties) affecting soil functions and ecosystem services. Both the state (i.e., condition) of soil structure and its vulnerability should be included for assessing soil structural degradation. To overcome the limitations of previous assessments, we developed a conceptual model linking soil structural vulnerability assessment to loss of soil functions and ecosystem services. Our review provides insights on assessment metrics and frameworks to develop management practices that improve soil structure and delivery of ecosystem services.</p>

<h3 id="comparing-the-prediction-performance-uncertainty-quantification-and-extrapolation-potential-of-regression-kriging-and-random-forest-while-accounting-for-soil-measurement-errors">Comparing the prediction performance, uncertainty quantification and extrapolation potential of regression kriging and random forest while accounting for soil measurement errors</h3>

<p>Geostatistics and machine learning have been extensively applied for modelling and predicting the spatial distribution of continuous soil variables. In addition to providing predictions, both techniques quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions, although geostatistics is more developed in this respect. Despite the increased use of these techniques, most algorithms ignore that the soil measurements are not error-free. Recently, concern has also arisen about the extrapolation risk of these techniques, be it in geographic space, feature space, or both. In this paper, regression kriging (RK) and random forest (RF) were compared with respect to their ability to deliver accurate predictions and quantify prediction uncertainties, while accounting for measurement errors in the soil data. The sensitivity of results of both models to soil measurement errors was also evaluated, as well as their spatial extrapolation potential. This was done for a case study in Cameroon where soil pH, clay and organic carbon were mapped from measurements obtained using both conventional and proximal soil sensing methods. The results showed that both models produced comparable ranges and maps of predicted values for the soil properties of interest. Compared to RF, RK outperformed RF by presenting generally a higher Model Efficiency Coefficient (MEC), lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values and better extrapolation performance. The improvement in RMSE was about 10, 12 and 2 % while the improvement in MEC was on average 5, 22 and 1 % for pH, clay and SOC, respectively Overestimation of the local uncertainty observed for RK was larger than that of RF as shown by accuracy plots, indicating that prediction uncertainties were better quantified by the RF model. Better extrapolation performance was obtained with RK that derived better predictions than RF at unsampled locations as shown by cross-validation metrics and scatter plots, particularly when RK and RF were used for spatial extrapolation. The effects of incorporating measurement errors were not significant both for the predictions and for the prediction uncertainties due to the fact that most calibration data had the same measurement error variance. Model comparison should go beyond common validation metrics that only evaluate prediction accuracy but must also account for the ability to quantify prediction uncertainty at unsampled locations.</p>

<h3 id="multivariate-random-forest-for-digital-soil-mapping">Multivariate random forest for digital soil mapping</h3>

<p>In digital soil mapping (DSM), soil maps are usually produced in a univariate manner, that is, each soil map is produced independently and therefore, when multiple soil properties are mapped the underlying dependence structure between these soil properties is ignored. This may lead to inconsistent predictions and simulations. For example, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) maps produced independently may show unrealistic carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratios. In the last decade the production of soil maps with machine learning models has become increasingly popular as these models are able to capture complex non-linear relationships between soil properties and environmental covariates. However, producing soil maps with multivariate machine learning models is still lacking and requires much investigation in DSM. In this paper we present the combined modelling of multiple soil properties with a multivariate random forest (MRF) model. We applied this model to mapping SOC and TN, and we compared it with results of two separate univariate random forest (RF) models. The comparison was done by means of stochastic simulations determined by sampling from the conditional distributions of the soil properties, given the covariates, as estimated by quantile regression forest. The results show that the MRF model is superior in terms of maintaining the dependence structure between SOC and TN, and consequently, is also able to produce more realistic C:N ratios. The models were also compared on the basis of prediction accuracy using commonly used accuracy metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE). We found that the accuracy of the MRF model (RMSE-SOC = 40.04, RMSE-TN = 2.26, RMSE-CN = 3.58) is comparable to that of the univariate RF models (RMSE-SOC = 39.76, RMSE-TN = 2.26, RMSE-CN = 3.65). We performed the same comparisons between a regression co-kriging model and two separate regression kriging models, and made similar conclusions.</p>

<h3 id="is-soil-an-organic-carbon-sink-or-source-upon-erosion-transport-and-deposition">Is soil an organic carbon sink or source upon erosion, transport and deposition?</h3>

<p>Soil may be a carbon source or sink under the effect of sediment and soil organic carbon (SOC) erosion, transport and deposition. Partial SOC processes to determine whether soil subjected to water erosion is a carbon sink or source have not been clarified but are essential for increasing and predicting SOC storage. In this review, the associations between SOC mineralization, stability and stock at erosion sites, in transported sediments and at deposition sites are clarified. An overview is given for possible determination standards that define soil carbon sinks and sources. Methods for enhancing SOC sequestration and suggestions for improving SOC prediction are also presented. Particle transport is an important intermediate process that determines the material base for SOC stability and sequestration in each erosion and deposition element. When subject to water erosion, a high probability of SOC physical stabilization and a thick soil layer are essential for soil to function as a SOC sink. Sediment transport weakens SOC physical protection in eroded areas but can promote aggregation factors at deposition sites in some cases while increasing the depth of SOC in the soil. In this circumstance, a good soil environment for plant growth facilitates the occurrence of carbon sinks. A concept for critical erosion intensity is proposed to understand SOC sink determination; the concept is presented as the volume of soil erosion per square kilometre (m(3) km(-2)) for which the maximum reduction in vegetation cover or plant biomass still permits plants to provide enough organic matter to compensate for erosion-induced SOC loss. If erosion intensity is higher than critical erosion intensity at the erosion site, soil degradation is obvious, and soil is presented as an OC source, and vice versa. Finally, the SOC burial method for increasing the soil carbon storage amounts in regions with thick soil layers is presented to explore the SOC sequestration potential in deep soil. The factors considered for SOC prediction should vary with research scale. We hope our review will have direct implications for the modelling of SOC dynamics under water erosion on both slopes and at large scales. HighlightsChanges in soil texture and soil thickness greatly affect the amount of SOC storage at erosion and deposition sites.Selective transport of soil materials or chemical elements promotes soil aggregation.Possible standards that define soil carbon sinks and sources and suggestions for improving SOC prediction are presented.SOC burial may be a good method for increasing C storage amounts in regions with thick layers of fine soil.</p>

<h3 id="a-framework-for-estimating-all-weather-fine-resolution-soil-moisture-from-the-integration-of-physics-based-and-machine-learning-based-algorithms">A framework for estimating all-weather fine resolution soil moisture from the integration of physics-based and machine learning-based algorithms</h3>

<p>Due to the effects of radio frequency interference and the limitations of algorithms under specific conditions, most of the currently available microwave-based soil moisture (SM) products are spatially discontinuous and have coarse spatial resolution, whereas optical observations also reveal various data gaps due to cloud contamination. Hence, the prediction of SM over invalid pixels and disaggregation from coarse to high scales are two main processes for obtaining SM at fine spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., daily/1-km). In the present study, two methods with respect to disaggregation-first or prediction-first were investigated from the synergetic use of the widely recognized European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) SM product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region. Specifically, the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) algorithm and the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) were implemented in the disaggregation and prediction, respectively. In DisPATCh, spatially complete land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM) were provided as essential inputs to downscale the microwave-based ESA-CCI to a spatial resolution of 1 km, whereas MODIS-derived LST, NDVI, land surface albedo and DEM were considered in the GRNN prediction. Following the two methods, the daily/1-km SM dataset over a period of three years was finally estimated. Assessments with ground in-situ SM measurements over the TP region reveal an acceptable accuracy with unbiased root mean square errors of similar to 0.06 m3/m3, indicating the potential to obtain operational daily/1-km spatially continuous SM products in future developments.</p>

<h3 id="global-soil-nitrogen-cycle-pattern-and-nitrogen-enrichment-effects-tropical-versus-subtropical-forests">Global soil nitrogen cycle pattern and nitrogen enrichment effects: Tropical versus subtropical forests</h3>

<p>Tropical and subtropical forest biomes are a main hotspot for the global nitrogen (N) cycle. Yet, our understanding of global soil N cycle patterns and drivers and their response to N deposition in these biomes remains elusive. By a meta-analysis of 2426-single and 161-paired observations from 89 published (15) N pool dilution and tracing studies, we found that gross N mineralization (GNM), immobilization of ammonium (INH4<script type="math/tex">{I}__4}</script>) and nitrate (INO3<script type="math/tex">{I}__3}</script>), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) were significantly higher in tropical forests than in subtropical forests. Soil N cycle was conservative in tropical forests with ratios of gross nitrification (GN) to INH4<script type="math/tex">{I}__4}</script> (GN/INH4<script type="math/tex">{I}__4}</script>) and of soil nitrate to ammonium (NO3-/NH4+) less than one, but was leaky in subtropical forests with GN/INH4<script type="math/tex">{I}__4}</script> and NO3-/NH4+ higher than one. Soil NH4+ dynamics were mainly controlled by soil substrate (e.g., total N), but climatic factors (e.g., precipitation and/or temperature) were more important in controlling soil NO3- dynamics. Soil texture played a role, as GNM and INH4<script type="math/tex">{I}__4}</script> were positively correlated with silt and clay contents, while INO3<script type="math/tex">{I}__3}</script> and DNRA were positively correlated with sand and clay contents, respectively. The soil N cycle was more sensitive to N deposition in tropical forests than in subtropical forests. Nitrogen deposition leads to a leaky N cycle in tropical forests, as evidenced by the increase in GN/INH4<script type="math/tex">{I}__4}</script>, NO3-/NH4+, and nitrous oxide emissions and the decrease in INO3<script type="math/tex">{I}__3}</script> and DNRA, mainly due to the decrease in soil microbial biomass and pH. Dominant tree species can also influence soil N cycle pattern, which has changed from conservative in deciduous forests to leaky in coniferous forests. We provide global evidence that tropical, but not subtropical, forests are characterized by soil N dynamics sustaining N availability and that N deposition inhibits soil N retention and stimulates N losses in these biomes.</p>

<h3 id="the-ecosystem-wilting-point-defines-drought-response-and-recovery-of-a-quercus-carya-forest">The ecosystem wilting point defines drought response and recovery of a Quercus-Carya forest</h3>

<p>Soil and atmospheric droughts increasingly threaten plant survival and productivity around the world. Yet, conceptual gaps constrain our ability to predict ecosystem-scale drought impacts under climate change. Here, we introduce the ecosystem wilting point (psi(EWP)), a property that integrates the drought response of an ecosystem’s plant community across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Specifically, psi(EWP) defines a threshold below which the capacity of the root system to extract soil water and the ability of the leaves to maintain stomatal function are strongly diminished. We combined ecosystem flux and leaf water potential measurements to derive the psi(EWP) of a Quercus-Carya forest from an “ecosystem pressure-volume (PV) curve,” which is analogous to the tissue-level technique. When community predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) was above psi(EWP) (=-2.0 MPa), the forest was highly responsive to environmental dynamics. When psi(pd) fell below psi(EWP), the forest became insensitive to environmental variation and was a net source of carbon dioxide for nearly 2 months. Thus, psi(EWP) is a threshold defining marked shifts in ecosystem functional state. Though there was rainfall-induced recovery of ecosystem gas exchange following soaking rains, a legacy of structural and physiological damage inhibited canopy photosynthetic capacity. Although over 16 growing seasons, only 10% of psi(pd) observations fell below psi(EWP), the forest is commonly only 2-4 weeks of intense drought away from reaching psi(EWP), and thus highly reliant on frequent rainfall to replenish the soil water supply. We propose, based on a bottom-up analysis of root density profiles and soil moisture characteristic curves, that soil water acquisition capacity is the major determinant of psi(EWP), and species in an ecosystem require compatible leaf-level traits such as turgor loss point so that leaf wilting is coordinated with the inability to extract further water from the soil.</p>

<h3 id="automatic-regionalization-of-model-parameters-for-hydrological-models">Automatic Regionalization of Model Parameters for Hydrological Models</h3>

<p>Parameter estimation is one of the most challenging tasks in large-scale distributed modeling, because of the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Relating model parameters to catchment/landscape characteristics reduces the number of parameters, enhances physical realism, and allows the transfer of hydrological model parameters in time and space. This study presents the first large-scale application of automatic parameter transfer function (TF) estimation for a complex hydrological model. The Function Space Optimization (FSO) method can automatically estimate TF structures and coefficients for distributed models. We apply FSO to the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM, mhm-ufz.og), which is the only available distributed model that includes a priori defined TFs for all its parameters. FSO is used to estimate new TFs for the parameters “saturated hydraulic conductivity “ and “field capacity, “ which both influence a range of hydrological processes. The setup of mHM from a previous study serves as a benchmark. The estimated TFs resulted in predictions in 222 validation basins with a median NSE of 0.68, showing that even with 5 years of calibration data, high performance in ungauged basins can be achieved. The performance is similar to the benchmark results, showing that the automatic TFs can achieve comparable results to TFs that were developed over years using expert knowledge. In summary, the findings present a step toward automatic TF estimation of model parameters for distributed models.</p>

<h3 id="differential-soil-acidification-caused-by-parent-materials-and-land-use-changes-in-the-pearl-river-delta-region">Differential soil acidification caused by parent materials and land-use changes in the Pearl River Delta region</h3>

<p>Soil acidification occurs widely across the world, which has been partly attributed to land-use change. However, measureable effect of land-use change as well as parent materials on soil acidification remains poorly understood. Here, a typical area with intensive land-use change in the Pearl River Delta of China was chosen for this study. Topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm) samples (n = 169) under different land uses (paddy fields, vegetable lands and orchards) and parent materials (granite and alluvial sediment) were collected in 2020. Soil pH, exchangeable base cations, exchangeable acidity and pH buffering capacity were measured to evaluate the status of soil acidification. The change of soil pH over the last 15 years was evaluated via comparing with historical data (n = 329) in 2005. The results showed a higher exchangeable acidity and lower pH buffering capacity and exchangeable base cations of soils derived from granite compared with soils derived from alluvial sediment in 2020. In the last 15 years, significant soil acidification under different parent materials was observed under vegetable lands and orchards but not paddy fields. Faster pH decline was found under land-use change from paddy fields compared with the unchanged vegetable lands or orchards. Furthermore, stronger acidification under the same land-use change was observed for soils derived from granite compared with soils derived from alluvial sediment. These results indicate that land-use change induced soil acidification is dependent on parent materials. This study implies that cropping management such as suitable rotation operation may slow soil acidification, and measures including straw returning may ameliorate acidified soils.</p>

<h3 id="end-user-oriented-pedotransfer-functions-to-estimate-soil-bulk-density-and-available-water-capacity-at-horizon-and-profile-scales">End-user-oriented pedotransfer functions to estimate soil bulk density and available water capacity at horizon and profile scales</h3>

<p>Soil available water capacity (AWC) and bulk density (BD) are key properties for understanding water flows in soils, land-use planning and irrigation management. As measuring these properties is costly and time-consuming, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are commonly used to predict BD and soil moisture at a specific matric potential and then estimate AWC. Currently, operational tools to estimate AWC at the soil profile scale from data easily available are lacking. In this study, new PTFs based on the regression-tree method Cubist were developed at a regional scale to predict soil water contents at -10 kPa (field capacity) and -1585 kPa (permanent wilting point), and BD. A first PTF (PC model) required commonly measured soil properties (sand, silt, clay, organic carbon contents), while the second (PM model) required four additional predictors: qualitative information deriving from description of the soil profile. The models were validated with an independent dataset. Both models outperformed existing PTFs. AWC was then estimated at the horizon scale, soil-profile scale and in the upper 30 cm of soil. The PM model performed better than the PC model with the training dataset at the profile scale (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.87 and 0.60; RMSE = 0.186 and 0.326 mm cm(-1), respectively). Independent validation of AWC estimates at the profile scale by the PM and PC models yielded RMSE of 0.192-0.204 and 0.229-0.244 mm cm(-1), respectively. The sensitivity of AWC to estimates of soil depth and coarse-fragment content was tested. Results confirmed the importance of these variables resulting in soil observation to estimate AWC accurately.</p>

<h3 id="potential-accumulation-of-toxic-trace-elements-in-soils-during-enhanced-rock-weathering">Potential accumulation of toxic trace elements in soils during enhanced rock weathering</h3>

<p>Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a carbon dioxide removal technology that aims at accelerating one of the most powerful negative feedbacks on Earth’s climate, the chemical weathering of silicates. To achieve this, ERW proposes to spread ground silicate rock on agricultural soils. According to many models, global application rates of 40 tonnes of ground basaltic rock per hectare and per year would be necessary to sequester a significant amount of CO2, representing up to 24% of the current net annual increase in atmospheric CO2. When assessing the viability of ERW as a global geo-engineering strategy, a pivotal but overlooked question to address is whether ERW may lead to toxic trace element accumulation in soils at unauthorized and potentially harmful levels. This study evaluates the legal sustainability of ERW with regard to trace element contents in soils. We compare different trace element accumulation scenarios considering a range of rock sources, application rates and national regulatory limits. The results indicate that, at the suggested annual application rate of 40 tonnes per hectare, the first regulatory limits would be exceeded after 6 and 10 years for copper and nickel, respectively. This study argues in favour of close tailoring of ERW deployment to local conditions in order to tap into its climate mitigation potential while preserving long-term soil uses.Highlights:center dot Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a carbon sequestration technology that consists in applying rock powder to soils.center dot This study evaluates whether rock powder application can lead to trace metals accumulation in soils beyond regulatory limits.center dot ERW can lead to the overrun of some environmental regulatory limits within less than a decade.center dot Specific site and rock selection will be necessary for this method to preserve long-term soil uses.</p>

<h3 id="warming-to-increase-cropland-carbon-sink">Warming to increase cropland carbon sink</h3>

<p>Temperature affects both erosion and carbon cycling in the soil. Research now shows that under warming, the replacement of soil organic carbon lost by erosion increases but the preservation of deposited carbon decreases, with an overall rise in the cropland carbon sink.</p>

<h3 id="experimental-drought-increased-the-belowground-sink-strength-towards-higher-topsoil-organic-carbon-stocks-in-a-temperate-mature-forest">Experimental drought increased the belowground sink strength towards higher topsoil organic carbon stocks in a temperate mature forest</h3>

<p>Reduced carbon assimilation by trees is often considered to lower the overall carbon sink function of drought-stressed forests. However, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks may respond differently to drought than ecosystem carbon flux dynamics, leading to imprecise predictions of soil carbon sequestration when one value is inferred from the other. As a major component of soil organic matter, SOC is the largest actively cycling terrestrial carbon reservoir, and thus fulfills various important ecosystem services. Yet, there is uncertainty about how SOC quantity and quality respond to drought in temperate forests. This study addressed the depth distri-bution of SOC stocks and soil organic matter stability in a forest exposed to artificial drought for five consecutive growing seasons below clusters of temperate mature deciduous beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and coniferous spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). In addition to SOC stock determination, we measured concentrations of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), performed density fractionation, and determined beta values of SOC (slopes of linear regressions between delta 13C of soil and log-transformed SOC content throughout soil depth profiles). Following drought, SOC stocks down to 30 cm depth increased by a factor of 1.5 under P. abies while they did not change with drought under F. sylvatica. Under both species, SOC stocks in the mineral topsoil (0-5 cm soil depth) increased by &gt;80 % with drought, increasing the relative contribution of this thin depth section to total SOC from 5 % to &gt;30 %. At 5-15 cm soil depth, SOC stocks decreased with drought under F. sylvatica but not under P. abies. With drought, carbon in the free light fraction (fLF) increased under F. sylvatica but declined marginally under P. abies. Results from density fractionation and beta values suggest decreased soil organic matter stability under F. sylvatica and increased stability under P. abies. Greater SOC accumulation suggests that the belowground carbon sink strength of drought-stressed forests increases, which contrasts with reduced ecosystem carbon uptake under drought.</p>

<h3 id="regional-scale-assessment-of-soil-functions-and-resilience-indicators-accounting-for-change-of-support-to-estimate-primary-soil-properties-and-their-uncertainty">Regional-scale assessment of soil functions and resilience indicators: Accounting for change of support to estimate primary soil properties and their uncertainty</h3>

<p>Researchers and stakeholders are increasingly interested in evaluating soil functions and their relationships with soil physical resilience to prevent and mitigate natural and anthropogenic threats. This study aims to assess the effect of changing spatial support on estimating primary soil properties that are then used to map compound indicators of soil functions. The specific objectives are to determine the epistemic uncertainty associated with the estimates and assess the impact of accounting for the change-of-support when scaling up from the point-to the block-resolution. The study area is the southern Italian region of Campania, which is renowned for its high-quality agricultural and dairy products but is increasingly subject to soil disturbance and degradation. Seven primary soil properties (sand and clay contents, oven-dry soil bulk density, calcium carbonate, rock fragment, soil organic matter, and pH) were estimated over 75-m x 75-m blocks by jointly analyzing more than 3,000 point-based soil measure-ments with gridded terrain attributes by using multi-collocated block cokriging. Two compound soil indicators were then assessed from the maps of these soil properties: 1) the soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) in the entire region of Campania, and 2) the recharge transit time in the Sele alluvial plain where information about the mean annual depth to groundwater is available. The change-of-support proved to affect the total variance and the assessment of the extremes in the probability distributions of the primary soil variables. Our results emphasize that negative consequences occur when the change-of-support problem, upscaling in particular, is overlooked as happens when analyzing environmental data, especially for planning purposes and in the case of environmental risk assessment.</p>

<h3 id="multi-level-monte-carlo-models-for-flood-inundation-uncertainty-quantification">Multi-Level Monte Carlo Models for Flood Inundation Uncertainty Quantification</h3>

<p>Flood events are the most commonly occurring natural disaster, with over 5 million properties at risk in the UK alone. Changes in the global climate are expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of flood events. Flood hazard assessments, using climate projections as input, guide policy decisions and engineering projects to reduce the impact of large return period events. Probabilistic flood modeling is required to take into account uncertainties in climate model projections. However, the dichotomous relationship between probabilistic modeling, computational cost and model resolution limits the applicability of such techniques. This paper examines improvements to traditional Monte Carlo methods using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) to quantify the uncertainty in flood extent resulting from input hydrograph uncertainty. The results demonstrate that MLMC is a more efficient modeling strategy than current methods (i.e., traditional Monte Carlo) with high resolution outputs produced in less time than previously possible. The novel application of MLMC technique to three Scottish case studies, demonstrating a variety of river characteristics, domain sizes and computational costs, using a high resolution 5 m grid resulted in a 99.2% reduction in computational cost compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods and up to 2.3 times speedup over Latin Hypercube Sampling.</p>

<h3 id="microplastics-effects-on-soil-biota-are-dependent-on-their-properties-a-meta-analysis">Microplastics effects on soil biota are dependent on their properties: A meta-analysis</h3>

<p>Microplastics (MPs) pollution is identified as an important new global change factor potentially influencing ecosystem functions and services. MPs have been shown to strongly affect soil biota. However, whether soil biota respond differently to biodegradable and conventional MPs, and the generalizable pattern of responses of soil biota to MPs size, dose and the time of exposure to MPs remain poorly understood. Here we conducted a global-scale meta-analysis of 781 observations from 92 publications to investigate the effects of MPs on soil biota (i.e., microbiota and fauna). We also explored how soil biota respond to different experimental conditions (e.g., MPs properties and experimental duration). Results showed that MPs significantly increased soil microbial biomass, while decreased the growth and reproduction of soil fauna (nematodes, springtails and earthworms). However, MPs significantly decreased soil bacterial diversity (Shannon index) and shifted microbial community structure, and the effect of MPs on soil bacteria was more intense than that on soil fungi. The responses of soil biota were dependent on MPs types, sizes, concentrations and experimental duration. For example, biodegradable MPs had stronger impacts on soil microbial community, while had weaker negative impacts on soil fauna than conventional MPs. Likewise, smaller size of MPs appeared to have more adverse impacts on soil bacterial diversity, and the growth and reproduction of nematodes, but this trend was opposite in the reproduction of earthworms. Furthermore, the response of soil microbial community and fauna significantly correlated with the MPs concentration and experimental duration, suggesting that soil biota exposed to MPs for high concentrations and long periods were more vulnerable. Regardless of specific experimental conditions, these results highlight that prolonged MPs pollution may have considerable negative effects on the structure and function of soil biota and consequently affect the ability of soil ecosystems to provide ecosystem services and sustain human societies.</p>

<h3 id="isotopic-approach-to-linking-landscape-and-catchment-storage-across-multiple-spatial-scales">Isotopic approach to linking landscape and catchment storage across multiple spatial scales</h3>

<p>Catchment heterogeneity leads to uncertainty about estimating timescales of storage and difficulty in extrapolating to larger scales. A heterogeneity-independent storage index (SI) was employed to build a connection with catchment characteristics, especially for landscapes, over six humid, forestry catchments. The SI is derived from the amplitudes of tracer cycles in precipitation and ephemeral/intermittent streamflow. The SI was significantly correlated with landscape metric (R2 = 0.81 and p = 0.014), specifically the fractal dimension index (FRAC) indicating the shape complexity of the landscape. Meanwhile, the topographic wetness index (TWI) (R2 = 0.77, p = 0.021) showed a close connection with the storage index as well. Close correlations suggested that the FRAC and TWI regulate the timescale of storage over the range of spatial scales, in particular the young water fraction in streams, because the SI is a heterogeneity-independent metric derived from seasonal tracer cycle amplitudes, which has a close relation to young water fraction. This also indicated the SI can be treated as an alternative travel-time metric and a reflection of the hydrological nature. Moreover, the findings implied the possibility of hydrological modeling over multiple spatial scales. The linkage between SI and landscape and topography provides insight into the mechanism of streamflow generation. Based on ephemeral streams, the crucial control of landscape and topography on the timescale of storage contributes to available water assessment and sustainable ecosystem management.</p>

<h3 id="development-and-application-of-new-transfer-functions-between-climate-and-soil-weathering-indices-for-paleoclimatic-reconstructions-from-chinese-loess-paleosol-sections">Development and application of new transfer functions between climate and soil weathering indices for paleoclimatic reconstructions from Chinese loess-paleosol sections</h3>

<p>The degree of weathering and soil formation under similar conditions with respect to parent material, relief position, vegetation, and age mainly depends on the climatic conditions. Therefore, various weathering indices have been used successfully to reconstruct past mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) based on the expression of these weathering indices in paleosols. Yet, no specific soil-climate transfer function has been established to reconstruct paleoclimates based on paleosols in Chinese loess profiles. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between several weathering indices and present climatic conditions for 49 soils throughout different climate zones in China (21°42′–47°54′ N), which were all developed in loess or similar Quaternary silty sediments. We aimed to establish soil-climate transfer functions that can be widely applied to paleosol-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions in Chinese loess archives and to apply them to a pedosedimentary record in northeastern China, where paleoclimatic information is still scarce.</p>

<p>Overall, MAT showed the strongest relationship with the weathering index ba1 ((K2O + Na2O)/Al2O3), with MAT = –29.887 ba1 + 22.361 (R2 = 0.788), and MAP showed the closest relationship with the Chemical Proxy of Alteration (CPA: Al2O3 × 100/(Al2O3 + Na2O)), with MAP = 0.0843 CPA3 – 20.143 CPA2 + 1630.7 CPA – 44,244 (R2 = 0.898). We applied these two transfer functions to a Late-Pleistocene pedosedimentary record in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, to reconstruct MAT and MAP from the onset of the Last Glacial Period until the Last Glacial Maximum. Our reconstruction yielded a warm-humid climate until the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5/4 transition and a trend towards a cooler and drier climate thereafter, interrupted by a somewhat warmer and more humid period during MIS 3. Despite several limitations, the newly established transfer functions can be applied to paleosols in loess-paleosol sections across the Chinese monsoon region and other regions around the world whose climates and parent materials are within the range covered by this study, because of the large supra-regional distribution of the soils included in this study. Thus, the new functions provide a new valuable tool for obtaining a substantial set of new paleoclimatic proxy data for various loess regions.</p>
