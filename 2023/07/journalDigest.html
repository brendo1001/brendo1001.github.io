<h3 id="bridging-structural-and-functional-hydrological-connectivity-in-dryland-ecosystems">Bridging structural and functional hydrological connectivity in dryland ecosystems</h3>

<p>On dryland hillslopes, vegetation water availability is often subsidized by the redistribution of rainfall runoff from bare soil (sources) to vegetation patches (sinks). In regions where rainfall volumes are too low to support spatially continuous plant growth, such functional connectivity between bare soil and vegetated areas enables the establishment and persistence of dryland ecosystems. Increasing the connectivity within bare soil areas can intensify runoff and increase water losses from hillslopes, disrupting this redistribution and reducing the water available to sustain ecosystem function. Inferring functional connectivity (from bare to vegetated, or within bare areas) from structural landscape features is an attractive approach to enable rapid, scalable characterization of dryland ecosystem function from remote observations. Such inference, however, would rely on metrics of structural connectivity, which describe the contiguity of bare soil areas. Several studies have observed non-stationarity in the relations between functional and structural connectivity metrics as rainfall conditions vary. Consequently, the suitability of using structural connectivity to provide a reliable proxy for functional connectivity remains uncertain and motivates the work here.</p>

<p>Relations between structural and functional connectivity metrics are established based on model simulations of rainfall-runoff on hillslopes with varying soil properties and vegetation patterns. These relations vary between two hydrologic limits – a ‘local’ (patch-scale) limit, in which functional connectivity is related to structural connectivity, and a ‘global’ (hillslope-scale) limit, in which functional connectivity is most related to the hillslope vegetation fraction regardless of the structural connectivity of bare soil areas. The transition between these limits within the simulations depends on rainfall intensity and duration, and soil permeability. While the local limit may strengthen positive feedbacks between vegetation and water availability, the implications of these limits for dryland functioning need further exploration, particularly considering the timescale separation between storm runoff production and vegetation growth.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-factors-and-spatial-dependence-explain-half-of-the-inherent-variation-in-carbon-pools-of-tropical-paddy-soils">Environmental factors and spatial dependence explain half of the inherent variation in carbon pools of tropical paddy soils</h3>

<p>The current study examined macro-environmental (climate and topography), micro-environmental (soil chemical properties) drivers, and spatially derived parameters that are significantly associated with soil carbon pools (0–15 cm) across tropical paddy-growing areas in Sri Lanka using the data from 987 sampling sites across the country. Redundancy analysis was performed to identify the relationships between the explanatory variables and the variation in different soil carbon pools i.e., total carbon (TC), Microbial Biomass Carbon (MBC), Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon (POXC), and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC). The spatial patterns in soil carbon pools were evaluated using Moran’s eigenvector maps. Results indicated that macro, micro-environmental drivers and spatial variables explained 47% of the inherent variation of the TC, MBC, POXC and DOC. Micro-environmental drivers had a larger unique fraction relative to macro-environmental drivers (4% and 1% of the total variation, respectively). Most of the variation explained by macro-environmental drivers was shared by micro-environmental drivers (11% out of 15%). Among macro-environmental drivers, rainfall and enhanced vegetation index were more strongly related to the soil carbon pools compared to the topography-related factors. In terms of micro-environmental drivers, total N, available K, Ca, and soil pH (H2O) were the best explanatory variables of soil carbon pools. Spatial patterns in soil carbon pools were largely induced by the environmental predictors that are spatially structured. Our findings provide insights into improving the reliability of spatial estimation of the soil carbon by incorporating important soil carbon preditors and quantifying the impacts of environmental changes on soil carbon pools.</p>

<h3 id="filling-the-maize-yield-gap-based-on-precision-agriculture--a-maxent-approach">Filling the maize yield gap based on precision agriculture – A MaxEnt approach</h3>

<p>Precision agriculture (PA) and yield gap (Yg) analysis are promising strategies to achieve the desired sustainable intensification of agricultural production systems. Current crop Yg approaches do not consider the internal field yield variability caused by soil properties. Topographic and edaphic characteristics causing consistent high and low yield patterns in time and space can be interpreted as an ecological niche and used as proxies for potential yield (Yp) and Yg. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are statistical models originally developed to forecast a species’ niche. However, its application to analyse crop yield spatio-temporal variability has never been made. This study aimed to fill this void by developing a novel approach: i) to quantify the magnitude and spatio-temporal distribution of Yp and Yg, ii) to identify the main factors that cause the Yg, and iii) to provide statistical and agronomical interpretation of the data to reduce the Yg. We performed this work using high-resolution maize yield maps from three seasons, with an ancillary dataset composed of soil electrical conductivity, soil properties and digital elevation models provided by “Quinta da Cholda”, Portugal. The yield maps were averaged, resulting in a standardised multiyear yield map. The 90th and 10th yield percentiles were interpreted as proxies for Yp and Yg, and analysed by an ENM machine learning algorithm – maximum entropy (MaxEnt). The average Yg and Yp were quantified as 1.5 and 19.1 ton/ha. Yp was characterised by having silty, richer soils and lower elevations, with several nutritional factors above the critical limits to maintain higher yields. Yg had loam soils coupled with higher relative elevations and lower nutrition content. This innovative modelling approach can efficiently manage high-dimensional spatio-temporal data to support advanced PA solutions, allowing detailed support for narrowing the Yg.</p>

<h3 id="the-enmap-imaging-spectroscopy-mission-towards-operations">The EnMAP imaging spectroscopy mission towards operations</h3>

<p>EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) is a high-resolution imaging spectroscopy remote sensing mission that was successfully launched on April 1st, 2022. Equipped with a prism-based dual-spectrometer, EnMAP performs observations in the spectral range between 418.2
 and 2445.5
 with 224 bands and a high radiometric and spectral accuracy and stability. EnMAP products, with a ground instantaneous field-of-view of 
 at a swath width of 30
, allow for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of surface variables from frequently and consistently acquired observations on a global scale. This article presents the EnMAP mission and details the activities and results of the Launch and Early Orbit and Commissioning Phases until November 1st, 2022. The mission capabilities and expected performances for the operational Routine Phase are provided for existing and future EnMAP users.</p>

<h3 id="measurement-of-lime-movement-and-dissolution-in-acidic-soils-using-mid-infrared-spectroscopy">Measurement of lime movement and dissolution in acidic soils using mid-infrared spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Acidification of surface and sub-surface soils limits agricultural production globally. Conventional surface application of lime is the most common amelioration approach for surface acidity. However, amelioration of sub-surface acidity is challenging to achieve using this approach. Testing the efficacy of liming to treat acidity through the soil profile via the measurement of lime movement requires high throughput information about soil properties at a high spatial resolution, which can be time consuming and expensive using traditional laboratory analysis. Here, we investigated the potential of Mid Infrared (MIR) spectroscopy as a tool to monitor lime dissolution and vertical movement through soils at high spatial resolution. Soil samples were collected at 2.5 cm intervals to 20 cm depth at three trial sites in South Australia, with various lime treatments applied either 6 years or 1 year prior to sampling. MIR Partial least squares regression (PLSR) predictions were undertaken to measure lime dissolution and alkalinity movement via soil pH, and undissolved lime presence via soil carbonate concentrations. Lime balance calculations were then performed to determine the fate of applied lime and assess efficacy of various rates of lime products applied at the surface only or via incorporation. MIR-PLSR prediction model performance was strong for both soil pH (R2 = 0.923 and RMSE = 0.202) and carbonate (R2 =0.829 and RMSE=0.042 CO3%). Results indicated the movement of alkalinity at all sites was limited, and revealed increased movement at the longer-term (∼6 years) vs shorter-term (∼1 year) sites where lime was surface applied. Lime balance calculations indicated that residual lime remained in the top 7.5 cm of the soil profile while soils remained acidic below this depth. Findings suggest that incorporation of residual lime and additional lime applications may be necessary to remediate sub-surface acidity. A decision tree was developed to inform management of surface and sub-surface soil acidity. The study validates the potential of MIR spectroscopy to measure and monitor the effectiveness and movement of lime with improved resolution in acidic soils.</p>

<h3 id="downscaling-legacy-soil-information-for-hydrological-soil-mapping-using-multinomial-logistic-regression">Downscaling legacy soil information for hydrological soil mapping using multinomial logistic regression</h3>

<p>In South Africa, there is a growing demand for large scale detailed hydrological soil maps for modelling and management purposes. However, imbalanced legacy soil information often impedes the accurate creation of such maps by not being representative of the environmental complexity of large-scale catchments and containing imbalanced soil class distributions, often resulting in the loss of minority soil classes, which are often of great hydrological importance (e.g., wetland and riparian soils). In this study, we proposed a new downscaling approach to handle spatially localised legacy soil data within a larger low resolution legacy soil dataset to create an accurate hydrological soil map of the macro-scale (5790 km2) Sabie-Sand catchment using multinomial logistic regression (MNLR). The spatially localised legacy data was downscaled using k-means clustering and added to the broader legacy dataset. Five levels of legacy soil data were analysed in their representation of environmental covariates using QQ-plots and a Welsh’s t-test and their mapping accuracy using confusion matrix’s and Kappa coefficient statistics. However, MNLR also requires balanced soil classes. The value of the best performing legacy soil dataset was also compared to using all available soil information after both had their soil class distributions fully balanced using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The 500 ha/observation-SMOTE dataset resulted in the most accurate hydrological soil map with a validation point accuracy of 73% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.60, substantially outperforming the other downscaled soil maps as well as the SMOTE balanced dataset using all available soil information. This was due to the decreased variation between observations and catchment means, where the 500 ha/observation dataset yielded the least variation between soil observation and catchment datasets and well as reducing the class imbalance within the legacy soil data. Downscaling spatially localised legacy soil data for environmental representation is an effective tool to improve digital soil mapping accuracy using MNLR.</p>
