&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-field-evaluation-of-the-soilvue10-soil-moisture-sensor&quot;&gt;A field evaluation of the SoilVUE10 soil moisture sensor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) has been engaged in ground-based soil water and soil temperature observations since 2009. As a nationwide climate network, the network stations are distributed across vast complex terrains. Due to the expansive distribution of the network and the related variability in soil properties, obtaining site-specific calibrations for sensors is a significant and costly endeavor. Presented here are three commercial-grade electromagnetic sensors, with built-in thermistors to measure both soil water and soil temperature, including the SoilVUE10 Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probe (hereafter called SP) (Campbell Scientific, Inc.), 50 MHz coaxial impedance dielectric sensor (model HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring Systems, Inc.) (hereafter called HP), and the TDR-315L Probe (model TDR-315L, Acclima, Inc.) (hereafter called AP), which were evaluated in a relatively nonconductive loam soil in Oak Ridge, TN, from 2021 to 2022. The HP manufacturer-supplied calibration equation for loam soils was used in this study. While volumetric water content data from HP and AP were 82-99% of respective gravimetric observations at 10 cm, data from SP were only 65-81% of respective gravimetric observations in the top 20-cm soil horizon, where soil water showed relatively large spatial variability. The poor performance of the SP is likely due to poor contact between SP sensor electrodes and soil and the presence of soil voids caused by the installation method used, which itself may have caused soil disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upscaling-soil-moisture-from-point-scale-to-field-scale-toward-a-general-model&quot;&gt;Upscaling soil moisture from point scale to field scale: Toward a general model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Field-scale soil moisture measurements are valuable but rarely available because the resolution of most satellite soil moisture products is too coarse, while most in situ sensors provide only point-scale data. Previous upscaling approaches for such data are mostly site-specific, and none are suitable to upscale data from the thousands of stations in existing monitoring networks. To help fill this gap, this research aims to develop a more broadly applicable upscaling approach using data from the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed and a cosmic-ray neutron rover. Rover survey data were used to measure average soil moisture for the similar to 64-ha field on 12 dates in 2019-2020. Statistical modeling was used to identify the soil, terrain, and vegetation properties influencing the relationships between the field-scale rover data and point-scale in situ data from six monitoring sites. Site-specific linear upscaling models estimated the field average soil moisture with root mean squared error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.007 to 0.017 cm(3) cm(-3), but such models are not transferrable between sites. To create a more general model, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression was used with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach to identify the key predictors for upscaling. The resulting parsimonious model required only the point-scale observations and sand content data and achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.006 to 0.031 cm(3) cm(-3) for the six monitoring sites. The texture-based model demonstrated reasonable accuracy and is a promising step toward a general model that could be broadly applied for upscaling point-scale in situ monitoring stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-lime-requirements-for-tropical-soils-model-comparison-and-development&quot;&gt;Estimating lime requirements for tropical soils: Model comparison and development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acid tropical soils may become more productive when treated with agricultural lime, but optimal lime rates have yet to be determined in many tropical regions. In these regions, lime rates can be estimated with lime requirement models based on widely available soil data. We reviewed seven of these models and introduced a new model (LiTAS). We evaluated the models’ ability to predict the amount of lime needed to reach a target change in soil chemical properties with data from four soil incubation studies covering 31 soil types. Two foundational models, one targeting acidity saturation and the other targeting base saturation, were more accurate than the five models that were derived from them, while the LiTAS model was the most accurate. The models were used to estimate lime requirements for 303 African soil samples. We found large differences in the estimated lime rates depending on the target soil chemical property of the model. Therefore, an important first step in formulating liming recommendations is to clearly identify the soil property of interest and the target value that needs to be reached. While the LiTAS model can be useful for strategic research, more information on acidity-related problems other than aluminum toxicity is needed to comprehensively assess the benefits of liming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revisiting-laboratory-methods-for-measuring-soil-water-retention-curves&quot;&gt;Revisiting laboratory methods for measuring soil water retention curves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional laboratory methods for measuring soil water retention curves (SWRCs) typically consist of suction tables, pressure cells, and pressure plate apparatus (i.e., traditional methods). However, technological advancement has resulted in newer methods based on precision mini-tensiometers and dew point water potential meters (i.e., modern methods). This study investigated the discrepancy between SWRCs measured using traditional and modern methods in three soil textures. Our results showed that SWRCs from both traditional and modern methods were similar at the wet end (i.e., matric potentials 0 to -10 kPa) and at the dry end (-500 to -1,500 kPa) of the SWRC, with an average mean absolute difference (MAD) across all three soils of 0.033 and 0.017 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The largest discrepancy between methods was consistently observed at moderate tensions of -33 and -70 kPa for the three soils, with an average MAD of 0.059 cm(3) cm(-3) for -33 kPa and a MAD of 0.083 cm(3) cm(-3) for -70 kPa. Plant available water capacity differed by up to 20% between the traditional and modern methods in a clay loam soil. While previous studies have mostly focused on the dry end of the SWRC, our study suggests that additional research comparing traditional and modern methods is required at moderate (-70 and -500 kPa) tension levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-identified-agronomic-interpretation-for-potassium-permanganate-oxidizable-carbon&quot;&gt;An identified agronomic interpretation for potassium permanganate oxidizable carbon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of clear empirical relationships between soil health and agronomic outcomes remains an obstacle to widespread adoption of soil health assessments in row crop systems. The objectives of this research were to (1) determine whether soil health indicators are connected to corn (Zea mays L.) productivity and (2) establish interpretive benchmarks for soil health indicators in Missouri. The objectives were accomplished by collecting corn grain yield at 446 monitoring sites (37 m(2)) in 84 commercial production fields in 2018-2020. Soil health and soil fertility samples were collected prior to planting at each site. These data, along with site-specific soil and weather data, were modeled using traditional stepwise regression and nonparametric random forest (RF) and conditional inference forest (CIF) approaches. Root-mean-square errors were similar (1.4-1.5 Mg ha(-1)) with distinct R-2 improvements over stepwise regression for both CIF (R-2 = 0.45) and RF (R-2 = 0.46) algorithms. Only seasonal rainfall and potassium permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) were included as top factors governing grain productivity in each model approach, thus demonstrating a regionally robust empirical relationship between POXC and grain productivity. Partial dependency analysis and two decision tree approaches identified 415 mg POXC kg(-1) as a threshold for maximum grain productivity, providing a framework for regional interpretation of on-farm soil health assessments. Little evidence was found connecting grain productivity with autoclaved citrate extractable protein and soil respiration. These findings underscore the power of POXC as an emerging soil health indicator to assess and quantify soil management effects on grain productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-simple-method-to-determine-the-reactivity-of-calcium-carbonate-in-soils&quot;&gt;A simple method to determine the reactivity of calcium carbonate in soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determination of soil carbonate is important for numerous chemical and physical soil processes in arid and semi-arid zones. Here, we modify a conventional method to more easily determine active CaCO3 (ACC) fraction in soils. Unlike the conventional method where the oxalate used up after reaction with carbonate is determined by titration with KMnO4, the proposed method uses the difference between total carbonate analyzed before and after reaction with oxalate to determine ACC. The method compared well to the conventional approach; the procedure was faster, did not require KMnO4, and appeared to be unaffected by exchangeable Ca. The proposed method is well-suited for samples across a wide range of total carbonate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-multivariate-approach-for-mapping-a-soil-quality-index-and-its-uncertainty-in-southern-france&quot;&gt;A multivariate approach for mapping a soil quality index and its uncertainty in southern France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedometricians have spent a lot of effort on mapping soil types and basic soil properties. However, end-users typically need a more elaborate soil quality index for land management. Soil quality indices are typically derived from multiple individual soil properties by evaluating whether specific criteria are met. If this is based on individually mapped soil properties, then an important consequence is that cross-correlations between soil properties are ignored. This makes it impossible to quantify the uncertainties associated with the mapped indices. The objective of this study was to map a soil potential multifunctionality index for agriculture (Agri-SPMI) over a 12,125 km(2) study region located along the French Mediterranean coast to help urban planners preserve soils of the highest quality. The index considered the ability of soils to fulfil four functions under five land use scenarios. A binary map represented each soil function fulfilment for a given scenario. The final soil quality index map was the sum of the 20 binary maps. A regression cokriging model was developed to map the basic soil properties first individually from legacy soil data and spatial soil covariates using a random forest algorithm, and next, interpolate the residuals using cokriging and the linear model of coregionalisation. The mapping uncertainties of soil properties were propagated by calculating the soil quality index over 300 stochastic simulations of soil properties derived from the linear models of coregionalisation. Results showed a poor prediction accuracy of the quality index, mainly because some soil properties were poorly predicted (notably available water capacity and coarse fragments) and used in combination with extreme thresholds that defined land suitability. Overall, the uncertainty was correctly quantified because the stochastic simulations reproduced the width of the observed distribution well, but the shapes of the distributions differed considerably from those of the observations. We envisage some ways for improvement, such as creating probability maps instead of the mean from simulations, and changing the prediction support from point to area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-large-scale-soil-moisture-monitoring-using-rail-based-cosmic-ray-neutron-sensing&quot;&gt;Toward Large-Scale Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Rail-Based Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil water content (SWC) monitoring. Stationary CRNS offers hectare-scale average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance-free and continuous in time, while car-borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail-borne system as the first of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an similar to 9 km railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train, supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric methods), car-borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail-borne CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC monitoring for larger scales (&amp;lt;= 10-km), with the additional benefit of providing root-zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub-daily resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-novel-physics-aware-machine-learning-based-dynamic-error-correction-model-for-improving-streamflow-forecast-accuracy&quot;&gt;A Novel Physics-Aware Machine Learning-Based Dynamic Error Correction Model for Improving Streamflow Forecast Accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occurrences of extreme events, especially floods, have become more frequent and severe in the recent past due to the global impacts of climate change. In this context, possibilities for generating a near-accurate streamflow forecast at higher lead times, which could be utilized for developing a reliable flood warning system to minimize the effects of extreme events, are highly important. This paper aims to investigate the potential of a novel hybrid modeling framework that couples the random forest algorithm, particle filter, and the HBV model for improving the overall accuracy of forecasts at higher lead times through the dynamic error correction schematic. The new framework simulates an ensemble of streamflow for estimating uncertainty associated with the predictions and is applied across two snow-fed Himalayan rivers: the Beas River in India and the Sunkoshi River in Nepal. Several statistical indices along with graphical performance indicators were used for assessing the accuracy of the model performance and associated uncertainty. The modeling framework achieved the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.94 and 0.98 in calibration and 0.95 and 0.99 in validation for the Beas and Sunkoshi river basin respectively for a 7-day ahead forecast. Thus, the proposed framework can be considered as a promising tool having reasonably good performance in forecasting streamflow at a higher lead time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spatially-explicit-linkages-between-redox-potential-cycles-and-soil-moisture-fluctuations&quot;&gt;Spatially Explicit Linkages Between Redox Potential Cycles and Soil Moisture Fluctuations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduction-oxidation cycles measured through soil redox potential (E-h) are associated with dynamic soil microbial activity. Understanding changes in the composition of, and resource use by, soil microbial communities requires E-h predictability under shifting hydrologic drivers. Here, 50-cm soil column installations are manipulated to vary hydrologic and geochemical conditions, and are extensively monitored by a dense instrumental deployment to record the depth-time variation of physical and biogeochemical conditions. We contrast measurements of E-h, soil saturation and key compounds in water samples (probing the majority of soil microbial metabolisms) with computations of the relevant state variables, to investigate the interplay between soil moisture and redox potential dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of joint spatially resolved hydrologic flow/transport and redox processes, the worth of contrasting experiments and computations for a sufficient understanding of the E-h dynamics, and the minimum amount of biogeochemistry needed to characterize the dynamics of electron donors/acceptors that are responsible for the patterns of E-h not directly explained by physical oxic/anoxic transitions. As an example, measured concentrations of sulfate, ammonium and iron II suggest coexistence of both oxic and anoxic conditions. We find that the local saturation velocity (a threshold value of the time derivative of soil saturation) exerts a significant hysteretic control on oxygen intrusion and on the cycling of redox potentials, in contrast with approaches using a single threshold saturation level as the determinant of anoxic conditions. Our findings improve our ability to target how and where hotspots of activity develop within soil microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-warming-from-global-food-consumption&quot;&gt;Future warming from global food consumption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food consumption is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and evaluating its future warming impact is crucial for guiding climate mitigation action. However, the lack of granularity in reporting food item emissions and the widespread use of oversimplified metrics such as CO2 equivalents have complicated interpretation. We resolve these challenges by developing a global food consumption GHG emissions inventory separated by individual gas species and employing a reduced-complexity climate model, evaluating the associated future warming contribution and potential benefits from certain mitigation measures. We find that global food consumption alone could add nearly 1 degrees C to warming by 2100. Seventy five percent of this warming is driven by foods that are high sources of methane (ruminant meat, dairy and rice). However, over 55% of anticipated warming can be avoided from simultaneous improvements to production practices, the universal adoption of a healthy diet and consumer- and retail-level food waste reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the role of the human diet in climate change has been widely acknowledged, current practices fail to capture its realistic effect on warming. In this Analysis, Ivanovich et al. develop a global food consumption emission inventory and estimate the associated future climate impact using a reduced-complexity climate model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods-for-reducing-the-tillage-force-of-subsoiling-tools-a-review&quot;&gt;Methods for reducing the tillage force of subsoiling tools: A review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation tillage technology (CTT) is a promising and efficient method for farmland protection and utiliza-tion. As one of the core technologies of CTT, mechanical subsoiling has been identified as an effective practice to disrupt hardpans and reduce soil bulk density to promote better water infiltration and crop root development. The tillage force during subsoiling (TFDS) is extremely high and methods for reducing the TFDS have been developed. A comprehensive summary about typical subsoiling tools and corresponding tool characteristics and current methods for TFDS reduction were reported in this review. The TFDS reduction methods were introduced in five aspects: biomimetic, oscillatory, lubrication, experimental, and others (i.e., line element design, layered subsoiling, crop straw and root anti-blocking, high-pressure gas splitting, rotary subsoiling, and selection of working depth and time). The mechanisms and limitations of current methods were analysed. The effect of various methods on draught forces of subsoiling tools with similar working parameters were quantitatively investigated and compared using statistical analyses. This review also recommends four future research di-rections about further reduction of TFDS to promote the development of TFDS reduction technology and CTT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interpreting-ramped-combustion-thermograms-using-13c-nmr-spectroscopy-to-characterize-soil-organic-matter-composition&quot;&gt;Interpreting ramped combustion thermograms using 13C NMR spectroscopy to characterize soil organic matter composition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many advanced analytical methods have been applied to soil organic matter (SOM), its highly complex and heterogeneous chemical composition still eludes complete characterization. Analytical thermal analysis has been proposed as a relatively rapid, inexpensive method for SOM characterization that requires no pre-treatment, but is challenging due to a lack of direct information about chemical composition. The goal of this study was to inform the interpretation of coupled differential scanning calorimetry and evolved gas analyses (DSC, CO2-EGA) using spectral correlations with solid phase 13C NMR data. We used a subset of soils collected as part of the Australian National Soil Carbon Research Program (SCaRP), which were physically fractionated and charac-terized using conventional analytical methods. Correlating the well-understood NMR spectra with the less -understood DSC and CO2-EGA thermograms provided some indications of which chemical compounds combust at which temperatures. Overall, the EGA data generated stronger correlations compared to correlations with DSC data, which was attributable to greater variability in DSC data due thermal reactions associated with minerals. Direct comparison of NMR and thermal data for the mineral associated organic matter in the fine (&amp;lt;50 mu m) fraction was not possible due to the need to demineralize samples prior to NMR analyses. Thermal analyses showed substantial differences in samples pre-and post-HF pretreatment, and the NMR data for HF treated samples showed scattered and weak correlation patterns with DSC and EGA data for untreated samples. While precise chemical compositions cannot be gleaned directly from thermal analyses results, thermal approaches provide an avenue of investigation into SOM reactivity based on bioenergetics that may be a quantitative rep-resentation of SOM persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regolith-or-soil-an-ongoing-debate&quot;&gt;Regolith or soil? An ongoing debate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitions of soil and regolith abound, the traditional view seeing soil as the top part of the regolith. Leighton (1958) claimed that soil and regolith are the same thing. Definitions of soil arising from research on soil and regolith in extraterrestrial, Precambrian, and some human-made settings tends to reinforce this view. Over the last two decades, the work of some researchers, including whole-regolith pedologists, has reinforced the case for Leighton’s claim, suggesting that soil and regolith are indeed the same and form pedo-weathering profiles. This view partly reflects a growing realization that the substratum plays an important role in some soil-forming processes, and should be included in soil classification schemes. The regolith-or-soil debate also applies when looking at soil in the contexts of the Earth System and the Critical Zone, both of which stress the connections between unweathered rock, weathered rock, fluid flows, and biological activity at local, regional, and global scales. It is unlikely that the debate will end: realistically, research on the whole-regolith pedological studies, including those that tackle wider links with the Earth System, will accompany pedological studies that focus on the solum and soil-forming processes within it, although they will assuredly inform each other; and, even though a case is made for regolith and soil being the same thing, it is will doubtless spark disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-many-bootstrap-replications-are-necessary-for-estimating-remote-sensing-assisted-model-based-standard-errors&quot;&gt;How many bootstrap replications are necessary for estimating remote sensing-assisted, model-based standard errors?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When probability samples are not available, the model-based framework may be the only option for constructing inferences in the form of prediction intervals for population means. Further, for machine learning and some non-parametric and nonlinear regression prediction techniques, resampling methods such as the bootstrap may be the only option for obtaining the standard errors necessary for constructing those prediction intervals.All bootstrap approaches entail repeatedly sampling from the original sample, estimating the parameter of interest for each replication, and estimating the standard error of the estimate of the parameter as the standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates over replications. The objective of the study was to develop a procedure for terminating resampling such that the resulting number of replications assures, at least in probability, that the estimate of the standard error stabilizes to the standard error corresponding to one million replications. The analyses used a variety of datasets: five forest inventory datasets with either volume or aboveground biomass as the dependent variable and metrics from either airborne laser scanning or Landsat as independent variables, three from Europe, one from Southwest Asia, and one from Africa; and two forest/non-forest versus Landsat datasets, one from Minnesota and one from Wisconsin, both in the USA. The primary contribution of the study was development and demonstration of a procedure that specifies criteria for terminating resampling that assure in probability that the bootstrap estimate of the standard error stabilizes to the estimate obtained with one million replications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;controls-on-the-presence-and-storage-of-soil-inorganic-carbon-in-a-semi-arid-watershed&quot;&gt;Controls on the presence and storage of soil inorganic carbon in a semi-arid watershed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) constitutes-40-50% of the terrestrial soil carbon and is an integral part of the global carbon cycle. Rainfall is a primary factor controlling SIC accumulation; however, the distribution and hierarchy of controls on SIC development in arid and semi-arid regions is poorly understood. The Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwestern Idaho is an ideal location to study factors influencing SIC because it spans a wide mean annual precipitation range (235 mm to 900 mm) along a 1,425 to 2,111 m elevation gradient and has soils derived from a wide variety of parent materials (granite, basalt, dust, and al-luvium). We collected soil samples along this elevational gradient to understand local controls on SIC distri-butions. SIC content was quantified at 71 soil pits and/or augered cores collected between approximately 0-1 m depth or until refusal. Consistent with previous studies, we found variations in precipitation governed the presence or absence of SIC; field measurements of the top 1 m of soils confirm little or no SIC in soils receiving &amp;gt; 500 mm in mean annual precipitation. Below this 500 mm threshold, SIC pools varied substantially and significantly between sites. Results showed that 90% of sites (64 sites) contained less than 10 kg m- 2 SIC, 7% (5 sites) contained 10-20 kg m- 2, and 3% (2 sites) contain between 24 and 29 kg m- 2 SIC. The total SIC within RCEW was estimated at-5.17 x 105 Mg. After precipitation, slope consistently ranked as the second most important predictor of SIC accumulation in random forest analysis. Wind-blown dust likely contributed to SIC accumulation; prior work indicates an average dust flux rate in RCEW of about 11 +/- 4.9 g m- 2 year -1. This study provides an initial model predicting SIC distribution and accumulation in a shrub-dominated dryland watershed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;environmental-microbiome-engineering-for-the-mitigation-of-climate-change&quot;&gt;Environmental microbiome engineering for the mitigation of climate change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental microbiome engineering is emerging as a potential avenue for climate change mitigation. In this process, microbial inocula are introduced to natural microbial communities to tune activities that regulate the long-term stabilization of carbon in ecosystems. In this review, we outline the process of environmental engineering and synthesize key considerations about ecosystem functions to target, means of sourcing microorganisms, strategies for designing microbial inocula, methods to deliver inocula, and the factors that enable inocula to establish within a resident community and modify an ecosystem function target. Recent work, enabled by high-throughput technologies and modeling approaches, indicate that microbial inocula designed from the top-down, particularly through directed evolution, may generally have a higher chance of establishing within existing microbial communities than other historical approaches to microbiome engineering. We address outstanding questions about the determinants of inocula establishment and provide suggestions for further research about the possibilities and challenges of environmental microbiome engineering as a tool to combat climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-based-explainable-ai-and-its-application-for-remote-sensing-image-classification&quot;&gt;Example-based explainable AI and its application for remote sensing image classification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present a method of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), “What I Know (WIK)”, to provide additional information to verify the reliability of a deep learning model by showing an example of an instance in a training dataset that is similar to the input data to be inferred and demonstrate it in a remote sensing image classification task. One of the expected roles of XAI methods is verifying whether inferences of a trained machine learning model are valid for an application, and it is an important factor that what datasets are used for training the model as well as the model architecture. Our data-centric approach can help determine whether the training dataset is sufficient for each inference by checking the selected example data. If the selected example looks similar to the input data, we can confirm that the model was not trained on a dataset with a feature distribution far from the feature of the input data. With this method, the criteria for selecting an example are not merely data similarity with the input data but also data similarity in the context of the model task. Using a remote sensing image dataset from the Sentinel-2 satellite, the concept was successfully demonstrated with reasonably selected examples. This method can be applied to various machine-learning tasks, including classification and regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-of-artificial-step-pools-in-natural-hazard-mitigation&quot;&gt;Application of artificial step-pools in natural hazard mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The step-pool is a representative riverbed structure that is highly effective in increasing flow resistance and dissipating flow energy. Well-designed artificial step-pools can control channel incision, improve riverbed sta-bility, and further mitigate natural hazards. In this study, step-pools following the characteristics of natural step -pools in terms of their geomorphology and energy dissipation are designed and applied to mitigate channel incision and debris flow, in a small watershed where riverbed structures are poorly developed and landslides and massive debris flow have occurred frequently as a result of channel incision. The jamming ratio of the step-pools is mostly less than 6.0, and the SP values, i.e., the development degree of riverbed are over 0.1, and these values are increased significantly compared with the original values, guaranteeing the stability of the constructed steps. Field investigation indicated that the artificial step-pools experienced little adjustment and generally remained stable during the flood season. The constructed steps caused a decreasing trend in deposition downstream, and achieved the expected effects in natural hazard mitigation effects by reducing and transferring the debris flows to hyper-concentrated flows and eventually to normal flood flows. Therefore, the stable step-pools effectively suppressed massive sediment movements, with 69.3% of the loose sediment eroded from the water erosion zone being trapped in the step-pool reach, which promoted uplift of the channel bed. Numerical simulation of debris flows reveals that the maximum kinetic energy of debris flow was reduced by about 27 % with the artificial step -pools compared to the pre-construction condition. The scientific findings and practical applications concerning the use of artificial step-pools could provide guidance for natural hazard mitigation in mountainous areas at the small watershed scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognition-of-potential-outliers-in-soil-datasets-from-the-perspective-of-geographical-context-for-improving-farm-level-soil-mapping-accuracies&quot;&gt;Recognition of potential outliers in soil datasets from the perspective of geographical context for improving farm-level soil mapping accuracies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil datasets with outliers lead to inaccurate farm-level digital soil mapping (DSM) results. Existing methods identify potential outliers in soil datasets based on expert experience or simple statistics that neglect the geographical characteristics of soil. In this paper, a novel potential outlier recognition method was developed from the perspective of geographical context. First, spatial search distance was automatically determined by the spatial distance among soil samples. Second, similarities of adjacent soil samples and the local spatial variation level were comprehensively considered to calculate outlier scores. Finally, a frequency histogram of outlier scores was generated to determine a suitable threshold for recognizing potential abnormal samples. To validate the proposed method, it was compared to Lambda and Box-Plot methods, and the ordinary kriging method was used to map five soil properties, including pH, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium, in an agricultural region. Then, a synthetic study using artificially contaminated DEM data was also conducted. The comparative experiment shows that the proposed method is better able to recognize potential outliers by mining the local spatial structure, as indicated by lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values. It can be concluded that consideration of local spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity is helpful in recognizing potential outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-rill-soil-erosion-in-agricultural-fields-with-uav-borne-remote-sensing-data&quot;&gt;Mapping rill soil erosion in agricultural fields with UAV-borne remote sensing data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil erosion by water is a main form of land degradation worldwide. The problem has been addressed, among others, in the United Nations Sustainability Goals. However, for mitigation of erosion consequences and adequate management of affected areas, reliable information on the magnitude and spatial patterns of erosion is needed. Although such need is often addressed by erosion modelling, precise erosion monitoring is necessary for the calibration and validation of erosion models and to study erosion patterns in landscapes. Conventional methods for quantification of rill erosion are based on labour-intensive field measurements. In contrast, remote sensing techniques promise fast, non-invasive, systematic and larger-scale surveying. Thus, the main objective of this study was to develop and evaluate automated and transferable methodologies for mapping the spatial extent of erosion rills from a single acquisition of remote sensing data. Data collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle was used to deliver a highly detailed digital elevation model (DEM) of the analysed area. Rills were classified by two methods with different settings. One approach was based on a series of decision rules applied on DEM-derived geomorphological terrain attributes. The second approach utilized the random forest machine learning algorithm. The methods were tested on three agricultural fields representing different erosion patterns and vegetation covers. Our study showed that the proposed methods can ensure recognition of rills with accuracies between 80 and 90% depending on rill characteristics. In some cases, however, the methods were sensitive to very small rill incisions and to similar geometry of rills to other features. Additionally, their performance was influenced by the vegetation structure and cover. Besides these challenges, the introduced approach was capable of mapping rills fully automatically at the field scale and can, therefore, support a fast and flexible assessment of erosion magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimizing-nitrogen-fertilizer-application-to-improve-nitrogen-use-efficiency-and-grain-yield-of-rainfed-spring-maize-under-ridge-furrow-plastic-film-mulching-planting&quot;&gt;Optimizing nitrogen fertilizer application to improve nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield of rainfed spring maize under ridge-furrow plastic film mulching planting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efficient nitrogen (N) fertilizer management strategies are integral components of rational farmland cropping systems. Ridge-furrow plastic film mulching (RFPM) is a widely used micro-catchment planting system in the rain-fed farming area of the Loess Plateau in China, there are still problems of excessive N fertilizer application and unreasonable application method under this system. In this study, we conducted a two-year field experiment with traditional flat planting (FP) as a control, to determine the effect of N application rate (180 kg ha–1, 240 kg ha–1, and 300 kg ha–1) on soil nitrate N, total N, grain yield and N fertilizer partial factor productivity (NFPF) of spring maize under RFPM with three ridge–furrow ratios (RF40–70 = 40 cm:70 cm; RF55–55 = 55 cm:55 cm; RF70–40 = 70 cm:40 cm). In addition, under N application rate of 240 kg ha−1, a micro-plot experiment was conducted to determine the fate of fertilizer N by applying N15-labeled urea on ridges and in furrows under RFPM, respectively. The results showed that compared with flat planting (FP), RFPM reduced the residue of NO3–-N (0–200 cm soil layer) and accumulation total N (0–100 cm soil layer) in the soil under three N application rates, especially under RF70–40. Reducing the N application rate decreased the accumulation of NO3–-N and total N under each ridge-furrow ratio. Compared with FP, RFPM increased the N accumulation, grain yield, NFPF for spring maize under all three N application rates. However, the N harvest index decreased as the N application rate increased under RFPM, thereby suggesting that the targeted N production could be improved for plants by optimizing the N application rate. By balancing the grain yield and NFPF, the optimal N application rates under FP, RF40–70, RF55–55, and RF70–40 were determined as 223 kg ha–1, 204 kg ha–1, 228 kg ha–1, and 207 kg ha–1, respectively, and these results also suggest that RFPM can lower the N input threshold compared with FP. In addition, N isotope tracing was used to clarify the fate of fertilizer N under RFPM, which showed that the contribution of fertilizer N to plants increased when N fertilizer was applied in furrows, and reduced the residual proportion of fertilizer N in soil. Therefore, our findings suggest that N fertilizer should be applied in the furrows after forming the ridges and furrows under RFPM.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Estimating nutrient transport associated with water and wind erosion across New South Wales, Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-nutrient-transport-associated-with-water-and-wind-erosion-across-new-south-wales-australia&quot;&gt;Estimating nutrient transport associated with water and wind erosion across New South Wales, Australia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutrient transported from soils to water bodies not only threatens agricultural productivity and food security but also causes the degradation of water quality and the environment in many parts of the world. However, nutrient transport through soil erosion is often ignored in nutrient cycle studies; there is little understanding of how much nutrient is lost through water and wind erosion. In this study, we attempted to assess soil nutrient transport due to both water and wind erosion and its spatial and temporal variability across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We estimated the mass fraction (%) of total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the eroded soil, and the total nutrient stock of the soil layer down to 200 cm using water and wind erosion models and digital soil mapping. The estimated average N, P and SOC stocks in NSW topsoils (0-5 cm) are 160, 43, and 2970 kg ha(-1) respectively. There are great variations in the transport of nutrients by erosion in space and time, ranging from near zero in the Western region to 395 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the North Coast region. The average total nutrient transport rate is about 2.4 % of the surface soil (0-5 cm) total stock in NSW due to both water and wind erosion. The total cost of nutrient transport is estimated at 4.2 billion Australian dollars for the entire state of NSW and 0.2 billion dollars from the cropping lands per year. The areas with the highest nutrient transport rates are the North Coast and Hunter regions due to the relatively high water erosion and nutrient content of the soils. On average, water erosion contributes up to 98 % of the total nutrient transport across the state as a whole, but wind erosion can contribute up to 12 % of the total transport in Spring (i.e., September). This study is the first attempt to investigate nutrient transport from both water and wind erosion in Australia. The methodology and findings contribute to the knowledge of nutrient transport due to erosion in broad nutrient cycle studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-structural-vulnerability-critical-review-and-conceptual-development&quot;&gt;Soil structural vulnerability: Critical review and conceptual development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil structure affects a range of soil functions (e.g., water, air, heat, and nutrient transport) and ecosystem services (e.g., production, climate regulation). Agricultural intensification is a dominant factor in global soil structural degradation. Understanding the vulnerability of soils to structural degradation may be important to land use planning and identifying management practices that mitigate the risk of degradation. We review the current methods for assessing soil structural vulnerability and the influencing factors, focussing on soil compaction and aggregate breakdown as two key measures of structural degradation. Methods for assessing risk of soil structural degradation and management practices affecting the risk are also discussed. Critical research gaps are identified, including the lack of studies that demonstrate the link between soil structural vulnerability and loss of soil functions or ecosystem services. Our review of the literature identified that the terms suscepti-bility, vulnerability, and risk are often used interchangeably. We propose definitions that can be used to distinguish these terms. Soil properties (relatively static), soil wetness, and land use stress (e.g., climate and management practices) are progressively included in the assessments of soil structural susceptibility, vulnera-bility, and risk. Existing indicators for assessing soil structural vulnerability may not be suitable to predict po-tential effects on ecosystem services. We highlight that soil structural vulnerability assessments should focus on key soil structural indicators (e.g., pore network-based hydraulic properties) affecting soil functions and ecosystem services. Both the state (i.e., condition) of soil structure and its vulnerability should be included for assessing soil structural degradation. To overcome the limitations of previous assessments, we developed a conceptual model linking soil structural vulnerability assessment to loss of soil functions and ecosystem services. Our review provides insights on assessment metrics and frameworks to develop management practices that improve soil structure and delivery of ecosystem services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparing-the-prediction-performance-uncertainty-quantification-and-extrapolation-potential-of-regression-kriging-and-random-forest-while-accounting-for-soil-measurement-errors&quot;&gt;Comparing the prediction performance, uncertainty quantification and extrapolation potential of regression kriging and random forest while accounting for soil measurement errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geostatistics and machine learning have been extensively applied for modelling and predicting the spatial distribution of continuous soil variables. In addition to providing predictions, both techniques quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions, although geostatistics is more developed in this respect. Despite the increased use of these techniques, most algorithms ignore that the soil measurements are not error-free. Recently, concern has also arisen about the extrapolation risk of these techniques, be it in geographic space, feature space, or both. In this paper, regression kriging (RK) and random forest (RF) were compared with respect to their ability to deliver accurate predictions and quantify prediction uncertainties, while accounting for measurement errors in the soil data. The sensitivity of results of both models to soil measurement errors was also evaluated, as well as their spatial extrapolation potential. This was done for a case study in Cameroon where soil pH, clay and organic carbon were mapped from measurements obtained using both conventional and proximal soil sensing methods. The results showed that both models produced comparable ranges and maps of predicted values for the soil properties of interest. Compared to RF, RK outperformed RF by presenting generally a higher Model Efficiency Coefficient (MEC), lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values and better extrapolation performance. The improvement in RMSE was about 10, 12 and 2 % while the improvement in MEC was on average 5, 22 and 1 % for pH, clay and SOC, respectively Overestimation of the local uncertainty observed for RK was larger than that of RF as shown by accuracy plots, indicating that prediction uncertainties were better quantified by the RF model. Better extrapolation performance was obtained with RK that derived better predictions than RF at unsampled locations as shown by cross-validation metrics and scatter plots, particularly when RK and RF were used for spatial extrapolation. The effects of incorporating measurement errors were not significant both for the predictions and for the prediction uncertainties due to the fact that most calibration data had the same measurement error variance. Model comparison should go beyond common validation metrics that only evaluate prediction accuracy but must also account for the ability to quantify prediction uncertainty at unsampled locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multivariate-random-forest-for-digital-soil-mapping&quot;&gt;Multivariate random forest for digital soil mapping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In digital soil mapping (DSM), soil maps are usually produced in a univariate manner, that is, each soil map is produced independently and therefore, when multiple soil properties are mapped the underlying dependence structure between these soil properties is ignored. This may lead to inconsistent predictions and simulations. For example, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) maps produced independently may show unrealistic carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratios. In the last decade the production of soil maps with machine learning models has become increasingly popular as these models are able to capture complex non-linear relationships between soil properties and environmental covariates. However, producing soil maps with multivariate machine learning models is still lacking and requires much investigation in DSM. In this paper we present the combined modelling of multiple soil properties with a multivariate random forest (MRF) model. We applied this model to mapping SOC and TN, and we compared it with results of two separate univariate random forest (RF) models. The comparison was done by means of stochastic simulations determined by sampling from the conditional distributions of the soil properties, given the covariates, as estimated by quantile regression forest. The results show that the MRF model is superior in terms of maintaining the dependence structure between SOC and TN, and consequently, is also able to produce more realistic C:N ratios. The models were also compared on the basis of prediction accuracy using commonly used accuracy metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE). We found that the accuracy of the MRF model (RMSE-SOC = 40.04, RMSE-TN = 2.26, RMSE-CN = 3.58) is comparable to that of the univariate RF models (RMSE-SOC = 39.76, RMSE-TN = 2.26, RMSE-CN = 3.65). We performed the same comparisons between a regression co-kriging model and two separate regression kriging models, and made similar conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-soil-an-organic-carbon-sink-or-source-upon-erosion-transport-and-deposition&quot;&gt;Is soil an organic carbon sink or source upon erosion, transport and deposition?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil may be a carbon source or sink under the effect of sediment and soil organic carbon (SOC) erosion, transport and deposition. Partial SOC processes to determine whether soil subjected to water erosion is a carbon sink or source have not been clarified but are essential for increasing and predicting SOC storage. In this review, the associations between SOC mineralization, stability and stock at erosion sites, in transported sediments and at deposition sites are clarified. An overview is given for possible determination standards that define soil carbon sinks and sources. Methods for enhancing SOC sequestration and suggestions for improving SOC prediction are also presented. Particle transport is an important intermediate process that determines the material base for SOC stability and sequestration in each erosion and deposition element. When subject to water erosion, a high probability of SOC physical stabilization and a thick soil layer are essential for soil to function as a SOC sink. Sediment transport weakens SOC physical protection in eroded areas but can promote aggregation factors at deposition sites in some cases while increasing the depth of SOC in the soil. In this circumstance, a good soil environment for plant growth facilitates the occurrence of carbon sinks. A concept for critical erosion intensity is proposed to understand SOC sink determination; the concept is presented as the volume of soil erosion per square kilometre (m(3) km(-2)) for which the maximum reduction in vegetation cover or plant biomass still permits plants to provide enough organic matter to compensate for erosion-induced SOC loss. If erosion intensity is higher than critical erosion intensity at the erosion site, soil degradation is obvious, and soil is presented as an OC source, and vice versa. Finally, the SOC burial method for increasing the soil carbon storage amounts in regions with thick soil layers is presented to explore the SOC sequestration potential in deep soil. The factors considered for SOC prediction should vary with research scale. We hope our review will have direct implications for the modelling of SOC dynamics under water erosion on both slopes and at large scales. HighlightsChanges in soil texture and soil thickness greatly affect the amount of SOC storage at erosion and deposition sites.Selective transport of soil materials or chemical elements promotes soil aggregation.Possible standards that define soil carbon sinks and sources and suggestions for improving SOC prediction are presented.SOC burial may be a good method for increasing C storage amounts in regions with thick layers of fine soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the effects of radio frequency interference and the limitations of algorithms under specific conditions, most of the currently available microwave-based soil moisture (SM) products are spatially discontinuous and have coarse spatial resolution, whereas optical observations also reveal various data gaps due to cloud contamination. Hence, the prediction of SM over invalid pixels and disaggregation from coarse to high scales are two main processes for obtaining SM at fine spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., daily/1-km). In the present study, two methods with respect to disaggregation-first or prediction-first were investigated from the synergetic use of the widely recognized European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) SM product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region. Specifically, the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) algorithm and the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) were implemented in the disaggregation and prediction, respectively. In DisPATCh, spatially complete land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM) were provided as essential inputs to downscale the microwave-based ESA-CCI to a spatial resolution of 1 km, whereas MODIS-derived LST, NDVI, land surface albedo and DEM were considered in the GRNN prediction. Following the two methods, the daily/1-km SM dataset over a period of three years was finally estimated. Assessments with ground in-situ SM measurements over the TP region reveal an acceptable accuracy with unbiased root mean square errors of similar to 0.06 m3/m3, indicating the potential to obtain operational daily/1-km spatially continuous SM products in future developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-soil-nitrogen-cycle-pattern-and-nitrogen-enrichment-effects-tropical-versus-subtropical-forests&quot;&gt;Global soil nitrogen cycle pattern and nitrogen enrichment effects: Tropical versus subtropical forests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tropical and subtropical forest biomes are a main hotspot for the global nitrogen (N) cycle. Yet, our understanding of global soil N cycle patterns and drivers and their response to N deposition in these biomes remains elusive.  Dominant tree species can also influence soil N cycle pattern, which has changed from conservative in deciduous forests to leaky in coniferous forests. We provide global evidence that tropical, but not subtropical, forests are characterized by soil N dynamics sustaining N availability and that N deposition inhibits soil N retention and stimulates N losses in these biomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ecosystem-wilting-point-defines-drought-response-and-recovery-of-a-quercus-carya-forest&quot;&gt;The ecosystem wilting point defines drought response and recovery of a Quercus-Carya forest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil and atmospheric droughts increasingly threaten plant survival and productivity around the world. Yet, conceptual gaps constrain our ability to predict ecosystem-scale drought impacts under climate change. Here, we introduce the ecosystem wilting point (psi(EWP)), a property that integrates the drought response of an ecosystem’s plant community across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Specifically, psi(EWP) defines a threshold below which the capacity of the root system to extract soil water and the ability of the leaves to maintain stomatal function are strongly diminished. We combined ecosystem flux and leaf water potential measurements to derive the psi(EWP) of a Quercus-Carya forest from an “ecosystem pressure-volume (PV) curve,” which is analogous to the tissue-level technique. When community predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) was above psi(EWP) (=-2.0 MPa), the forest was highly responsive to environmental dynamics. When psi(pd) fell below psi(EWP), the forest became insensitive to environmental variation and was a net source of carbon dioxide for nearly 2 months. Thus, psi(EWP) is a threshold defining marked shifts in ecosystem functional state. Though there was rainfall-induced recovery of ecosystem gas exchange following soaking rains, a legacy of structural and physiological damage inhibited canopy photosynthetic capacity. Although over 16 growing seasons, only 10% of psi(pd) observations fell below psi(EWP), the forest is commonly only 2-4 weeks of intense drought away from reaching psi(EWP), and thus highly reliant on frequent rainfall to replenish the soil water supply. We propose, based on a bottom-up analysis of root density profiles and soil moisture characteristic curves, that soil water acquisition capacity is the major determinant of psi(EWP), and species in an ecosystem require compatible leaf-level traits such as turgor loss point so that leaf wilting is coordinated with the inability to extract further water from the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automatic-regionalization-of-model-parameters-for-hydrological-models&quot;&gt;Automatic Regionalization of Model Parameters for Hydrological Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parameter estimation is one of the most challenging tasks in large-scale distributed modeling, because of the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Relating model parameters to catchment/landscape characteristics reduces the number of parameters, enhances physical realism, and allows the transfer of hydrological model parameters in time and space. This study presents the first large-scale application of automatic parameter transfer function (TF) estimation for a complex hydrological model. The Function Space Optimization (FSO) method can automatically estimate TF structures and coefficients for distributed models. We apply FSO to the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM, mhm-ufz.og), which is the only available distributed model that includes a priori defined TFs for all its parameters. FSO is used to estimate new TFs for the parameters “saturated hydraulic conductivity “ and “field capacity, “ which both influence a range of hydrological processes. The setup of mHM from a previous study serves as a benchmark. The estimated TFs resulted in predictions in 222 validation basins with a median NSE of 0.68, showing that even with 5 years of calibration data, high performance in ungauged basins can be achieved. The performance is similar to the benchmark results, showing that the automatic TFs can achieve comparable results to TFs that were developed over years using expert knowledge. In summary, the findings present a step toward automatic TF estimation of model parameters for distributed models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;differential-soil-acidification-caused-by-parent-materials-and-land-use-changes-in-the-pearl-river-delta-region&quot;&gt;Differential soil acidification caused by parent materials and land-use changes in the Pearl River Delta region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil acidification occurs widely across the world, which has been partly attributed to land-use change. However, measureable effect of land-use change as well as parent materials on soil acidification remains poorly understood. Here, a typical area with intensive land-use change in the Pearl River Delta of China was chosen for this study. Topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm) samples (n = 169) under different land uses (paddy fields, vegetable lands and orchards) and parent materials (granite and alluvial sediment) were collected in 2020. Soil pH, exchangeable base cations, exchangeable acidity and pH buffering capacity were measured to evaluate the status of soil acidification. The change of soil pH over the last 15 years was evaluated via comparing with historical data (n = 329) in 2005. The results showed a higher exchangeable acidity and lower pH buffering capacity and exchangeable base cations of soils derived from granite compared with soils derived from alluvial sediment in 2020. In the last 15 years, significant soil acidification under different parent materials was observed under vegetable lands and orchards but not paddy fields. Faster pH decline was found under land-use change from paddy fields compared with the unchanged vegetable lands or orchards. Furthermore, stronger acidification under the same land-use change was observed for soils derived from granite compared with soils derived from alluvial sediment. These results indicate that land-use change induced soil acidification is dependent on parent materials. This study implies that cropping management such as suitable rotation operation may slow soil acidification, and measures including straw returning may ameliorate acidified soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-user-oriented-pedotransfer-functions-to-estimate-soil-bulk-density-and-available-water-capacity-at-horizon-and-profile-scales&quot;&gt;End-user-oriented pedotransfer functions to estimate soil bulk density and available water capacity at horizon and profile scales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil available water capacity (AWC) and bulk density (BD) are key properties for understanding water flows in soils, land-use planning and irrigation management. As measuring these properties is costly and time-consuming, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are commonly used to predict BD and soil moisture at a specific matric potential and then estimate AWC. Currently, operational tools to estimate AWC at the soil profile scale from data easily available are lacking. In this study, new PTFs based on the regression-tree method Cubist were developed at a regional scale to predict soil water contents at -10 kPa (field capacity) and -1585 kPa (permanent wilting point), and BD. A first PTF (PC model) required commonly measured soil properties (sand, silt, clay, organic carbon contents), while the second (PM model) required four additional predictors: qualitative information deriving from description of the soil profile. The models were validated with an independent dataset. Both models outperformed existing PTFs. AWC was then estimated at the horizon scale, soil-profile scale and in the upper 30 cm of soil. The PM model performed better than the PC model with the training dataset at the profile scale (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.87 and 0.60; RMSE = 0.186 and 0.326 mm cm(-1), respectively). Independent validation of AWC estimates at the profile scale by the PM and PC models yielded RMSE of 0.192-0.204 and 0.229-0.244 mm cm(-1), respectively. The sensitivity of AWC to estimates of soil depth and coarse-fragment content was tested. Results confirmed the importance of these variables resulting in soil observation to estimate AWC accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;potential-accumulation-of-toxic-trace-elements-in-soils-during-enhanced-rock-weathering&quot;&gt;Potential accumulation of toxic trace elements in soils during enhanced rock weathering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a carbon dioxide removal technology that aims at accelerating one of the most powerful negative feedbacks on Earth’s climate, the chemical weathering of silicates. To achieve this, ERW proposes to spread ground silicate rock on agricultural soils. According to many models, global application rates of 40 tonnes of ground basaltic rock per hectare and per year would be necessary to sequester a significant amount of CO2, representing up to 24% of the current net annual increase in atmospheric CO2. When assessing the viability of ERW as a global geo-engineering strategy, a pivotal but overlooked question to address is whether ERW may lead to toxic trace element accumulation in soils at unauthorized and potentially harmful levels. This study evaluates the legal sustainability of ERW with regard to trace element contents in soils. We compare different trace element accumulation scenarios considering a range of rock sources, application rates and national regulatory limits. The results indicate that, at the suggested annual application rate of 40 tonnes per hectare, the first regulatory limits would be exceeded after 6 and 10 years for copper and nickel, respectively. This study argues in favour of close tailoring of ERW deployment to local conditions in order to tap into its climate mitigation potential while preserving long-term soil uses.Highlights:center dot Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a carbon sequestration technology that consists in applying rock powder to soils.center dot This study evaluates whether rock powder application can lead to trace metals accumulation in soils beyond regulatory limits.center dot ERW can lead to the overrun of some environmental regulatory limits within less than a decade.center dot Specific site and rock selection will be necessary for this method to preserve long-term soil uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warming-to-increase-cropland-carbon-sink&quot;&gt;Warming to increase cropland carbon sink&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperature affects both erosion and carbon cycling in the soil. Research now shows that under warming, the replacement of soil organic carbon lost by erosion increases but the preservation of deposited carbon decreases, with an overall rise in the cropland carbon sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;experimental-drought-increased-the-belowground-sink-strength-towards-higher-topsoil-organic-carbon-stocks-in-a-temperate-mature-forest&quot;&gt;Experimental drought increased the belowground sink strength towards higher topsoil organic carbon stocks in a temperate mature forest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduced carbon assimilation by trees is often considered to lower the overall carbon sink function of drought-stressed forests. However, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks may respond differently to drought than ecosystem carbon flux dynamics, leading to imprecise predictions of soil carbon sequestration when one value is inferred from the other. As a major component of soil organic matter, SOC is the largest actively cycling terrestrial carbon reservoir, and thus fulfills various important ecosystem services. Yet, there is uncertainty about how SOC quantity and quality respond to drought in temperate forests. This study addressed the depth distri-bution of SOC stocks and soil organic matter stability in a forest exposed to artificial drought for five consecutive growing seasons below clusters of temperate mature deciduous beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and coniferous spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). In addition to SOC stock determination, we measured concentrations of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), performed density fractionation, and determined beta values of SOC (slopes of linear regressions between delta 13C of soil and log-transformed SOC content throughout soil depth profiles). Following drought, SOC stocks down to 30 cm depth increased by a factor of 1.5 under P. abies while they did not change with drought under F. sylvatica. Under both species, SOC stocks in the mineral topsoil (0-5 cm soil depth) increased by &amp;gt;80 % with drought, increasing the relative contribution of this thin depth section to total SOC from 5 % to &amp;gt;30 %. At 5-15 cm soil depth, SOC stocks decreased with drought under F. sylvatica but not under P. abies. With drought, carbon in the free light fraction (fLF) increased under F. sylvatica but declined marginally under P. abies. Results from density fractionation and beta values suggest decreased soil organic matter stability under F. sylvatica and increased stability under P. abies. Greater SOC accumulation suggests that the belowground carbon sink strength of drought-stressed forests increases, which contrasts with reduced ecosystem carbon uptake under drought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regional-scale-assessment-of-soil-functions-and-resilience-indicators-accounting-for-change-of-support-to-estimate-primary-soil-properties-and-their-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Regional-scale assessment of soil functions and resilience indicators: Accounting for change of support to estimate primary soil properties and their uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers and stakeholders are increasingly interested in evaluating soil functions and their relationships with soil physical resilience to prevent and mitigate natural and anthropogenic threats. This study aims to assess the effect of changing spatial support on estimating primary soil properties that are then used to map compound indicators of soil functions. The specific objectives are to determine the epistemic uncertainty associated with the estimates and assess the impact of accounting for the change-of-support when scaling up from the point-to the block-resolution. The study area is the southern Italian region of Campania, which is renowned for its high-quality agricultural and dairy products but is increasingly subject to soil disturbance and degradation. Seven primary soil properties (sand and clay contents, oven-dry soil bulk density, calcium carbonate, rock fragment, soil organic matter, and pH) were estimated over 75-m x 75-m blocks by jointly analyzing more than 3,000 point-based soil measure-ments with gridded terrain attributes by using multi-collocated block cokriging. Two compound soil indicators were then assessed from the maps of these soil properties: 1) the soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) in the entire region of Campania, and 2) the recharge transit time in the Sele alluvial plain where information about the mean annual depth to groundwater is available. The change-of-support proved to affect the total variance and the assessment of the extremes in the probability distributions of the primary soil variables. Our results emphasize that negative consequences occur when the change-of-support problem, upscaling in particular, is overlooked as happens when analyzing environmental data, especially for planning purposes and in the case of environmental risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-level-monte-carlo-models-for-flood-inundation-uncertainty-quantification&quot;&gt;Multi-Level Monte Carlo Models for Flood Inundation Uncertainty Quantification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flood events are the most commonly occurring natural disaster, with over 5 million properties at risk in the UK alone. Changes in the global climate are expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of flood events. Flood hazard assessments, using climate projections as input, guide policy decisions and engineering projects to reduce the impact of large return period events. Probabilistic flood modeling is required to take into account uncertainties in climate model projections. However, the dichotomous relationship between probabilistic modeling, computational cost and model resolution limits the applicability of such techniques. This paper examines improvements to traditional Monte Carlo methods using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) to quantify the uncertainty in flood extent resulting from input hydrograph uncertainty. The results demonstrate that MLMC is a more efficient modeling strategy than current methods (i.e., traditional Monte Carlo) with high resolution outputs produced in less time than previously possible. The novel application of MLMC technique to three Scottish case studies, demonstrating a variety of river characteristics, domain sizes and computational costs, using a high resolution 5 m grid resulted in a 99.2% reduction in computational cost compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods and up to 2.3 times speedup over Latin Hypercube Sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microplastics-effects-on-soil-biota-are-dependent-on-their-properties-a-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;Microplastics effects on soil biota are dependent on their properties: A meta-analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microplastics (MPs) pollution is identified as an important new global change factor potentially influencing ecosystem functions and services. MPs have been shown to strongly affect soil biota. However, whether soil biota respond differently to biodegradable and conventional MPs, and the generalizable pattern of responses of soil biota to MPs size, dose and the time of exposure to MPs remain poorly understood. Here we conducted a global-scale meta-analysis of 781 observations from 92 publications to investigate the effects of MPs on soil biota (i.e., microbiota and fauna). We also explored how soil biota respond to different experimental conditions (e.g., MPs properties and experimental duration). Results showed that MPs significantly increased soil microbial biomass, while decreased the growth and reproduction of soil fauna (nematodes, springtails and earthworms). However, MPs significantly decreased soil bacterial diversity (Shannon index) and shifted microbial community structure, and the effect of MPs on soil bacteria was more intense than that on soil fungi. The responses of soil biota were dependent on MPs types, sizes, concentrations and experimental duration. For example, biodegradable MPs had stronger impacts on soil microbial community, while had weaker negative impacts on soil fauna than conventional MPs. Likewise, smaller size of MPs appeared to have more adverse impacts on soil bacterial diversity, and the growth and reproduction of nematodes, but this trend was opposite in the reproduction of earthworms. Furthermore, the response of soil microbial community and fauna significantly correlated with the MPs concentration and experimental duration, suggesting that soil biota exposed to MPs for high concentrations and long periods were more vulnerable. Regardless of specific experimental conditions, these results highlight that prolonged MPs pollution may have considerable negative effects on the structure and function of soil biota and consequently affect the ability of soil ecosystems to provide ecosystem services and sustain human societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;isotopic-approach-to-linking-landscape-and-catchment-storage-across-multiple-spatial-scales&quot;&gt;Isotopic approach to linking landscape and catchment storage across multiple spatial scales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catchment heterogeneity leads to uncertainty about estimating timescales of storage and difficulty in extrapolating to larger scales. A heterogeneity-independent storage index (SI) was employed to build a connection with catchment characteristics, especially for landscapes, over six humid, forestry catchments. The SI is derived from the amplitudes of tracer cycles in precipitation and ephemeral/intermittent streamflow. The SI was significantly correlated with landscape metric (R2 = 0.81 and p = 0.014), specifically the fractal dimension index (FRAC) indicating the shape complexity of the landscape. Meanwhile, the topographic wetness index (TWI) (R2 = 0.77, p = 0.021) showed a close connection with the storage index as well. Close correlations suggested that the FRAC and TWI regulate the timescale of storage over the range of spatial scales, in particular the young water fraction in streams, because the SI is a heterogeneity-independent metric derived from seasonal tracer cycle amplitudes, which has a close relation to young water fraction. This also indicated the SI can be treated as an alternative travel-time metric and a reflection of the hydrological nature. Moreover, the findings implied the possibility of hydrological modeling over multiple spatial scales. The linkage between SI and landscape and topography provides insight into the mechanism of streamflow generation. Based on ephemeral streams, the crucial control of landscape and topography on the timescale of storage contributes to available water assessment and sustainable ecosystem management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development-and-application-of-new-transfer-functions-between-climate-and-soil-weathering-indices-for-paleoclimatic-reconstructions-from-chinese-loess-paleosol-sections&quot;&gt;Development and application of new transfer functions between climate and soil weathering indices for paleoclimatic reconstructions from Chinese loess-paleosol sections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree of weathering and soil formation under similar conditions with respect to parent material, relief position, vegetation, and age mainly depends on the climatic conditions. Therefore, various weathering indices have been used successfully to reconstruct past mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) based on the expression of these weathering indices in paleosols. Yet, no specific soil-climate transfer function has been established to reconstruct paleoclimates based on paleosols in Chinese loess profiles. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between several weathering indices and present climatic conditions for 49 soils throughout different climate zones in China (21°42′–47°54′ N), which were all developed in loess or similar Quaternary silty sediments. We aimed to establish soil-climate transfer functions that can be widely applied to paleosol-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions in Chinese loess archives and to apply them to a pedosedimentary record in northeastern China, where paleoclimatic information is still scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, MAT showed the strongest relationship with the weathering index ba1 ((K2O + Na2O)/Al2O3), with MAT = –29.887 ba1 + 22.361 (R2 = 0.788), and MAP showed the closest relationship with the Chemical Proxy of Alteration (CPA: Al2O3 × 100/(Al2O3 + Na2O)), with MAP = 0.0843 CPA3 – 20.143 CPA2 + 1630.7 CPA – 44,244 (R2 = 0.898). We applied these two transfer functions to a Late-Pleistocene pedosedimentary record in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, to reconstruct MAT and MAP from the onset of the Last Glacial Period until the Last Glacial Maximum. Our reconstruction yielded a warm-humid climate until the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5/4 transition and a trend towards a cooler and drier climate thereafter, interrupted by a somewhat warmer and more humid period during MIS 3. Despite several limitations, the newly established transfer functions can be applied to paleosols in loess-paleosol sections across the Chinese monsoon region and other regions around the world whose climates and parent materials are within the range covered by this study, because of the large supra-regional distribution of the soils included in this study. Thus, the new functions provide a new valuable tool for obtaining a substantial set of new paleoclimatic proxy data for various loess regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparing-satellites-and-vegetation-indices-for-cover-crop-biomass-estimation&quot;&gt;Comparing satellites and vegetation indices for cover crop biomass estimation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost-share programs based on measures of participation rather than performance are available to farmers who plant cover crops. However, cover crops only provide significant ecological benefits like reduced nutrient loss when adequate biomass is established. The purpose of this study was to determine whether satellite imagery can effectively estimate cover crop biomass in fields with diverse species composition, and whether increased spatial resolution and satellite imaging frequency can increase biomass estimation accuracy. Aboveground biomass samples of 1 m(2) were collected for 86 sites within 26 agricultural fields containing unique cover crop species composition to assess biomass production. In-field sensors were used to measure normalized difference vege-tation index (NDVI) and groundcover percentage. Three satellites (Landsat-8 [30 m resolution], Sentinel-2 [10 m resolution], and PlanetScope [3 m resolution]) were used to calculate eight vegetation indices (VIs) for com-parison with cover crop biomass. Multiple linear regression, correlation coefficients, and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to perform hierarchical clustering to rank VIs calculated from each satellite for biomass estimation accuracy. Satellites predicted cover crop biomass at the field level very accurately (r(2) up to 0.79), demonstrating the potential of large-scale biomass estimation at relatively low cost compared to in-field sam-pling. All satellite-VI pairs estimated biomass more accurately than the in-field sensors. Performance of VIs varied by satellite, but each satellite had at least one VI that performed very well for both site-level and field-averaged data. When using PlanetScope or Landsat-8 imagery, the perpendicular vegetation index provided the most accurate cover crop biomass estimation on a per-site basis and ratio vegetation index performed best using Sentinel-2 imagery. PlanetScope was the only satellite to provide useable imagery for every site due to increased revisit period; however, its increased spatial resolution did not increase estimation accuracy overall compared to Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-criteria-for-greenhouse-gas-flux-estimation-with-automatic-and-manual-chambers-a-case-study-for-n2o&quot;&gt;Identifying criteria for greenhouse gas flux estimation with automatic and manual chambers: A case study for N2O&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluxes of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) are mainly quantified using manually operated or automatic non-steady-state chambers. With both systems, fluxes are calculated as the change in N2O concentration over time using linear or non-linear regression, but the type of regression selected can have a strong influence on the N2O flux magnitude. The HMR package, a regression-based implementation of the Hutchinson &amp;amp; Mosier Regression, is a widely used software for trace gas flux calculation that provides a recommendation on the most appropriate regression method based on several criteria. New parameters were recently introduced which allow for pre-filtering based on sample variance (pfvar and pfalpha), and for constraining the curvilinearity of concentration-time series(SatPct and SatTimeMin). Currently, there are no guidelines on how to choose the best parameters for specific user conditions. Here we address this knowledge gap using datasets from manual and automatic chambers, and sensitivity analyses. We found that the effect of parameter settings on the cumulative fluxes was greater for manual chamber data compared to the automatic chamber data, with ranges of up to 67.3% and 1.5%, respectively. The parameter pfvar was identified as highly sensitive for both manual and automatic chambers; it is, therefore, critical to select a threshold for when to allow for non-linear flux calculation that accurately represents the given measurement precision. This can be estimated from the variance of N2O measurements at ambient concentration levels. The parameter SatTimeMin was critical for manual chamber data where the curvature is much less constrained due to the lower number of observations. The parameter pfalpha was the least sensitive and can be set at a p-value equal to 0.05 following common statistical practice. Parameter values depend on the expected flux characteristics with a given chamber design and are currently best selected based on visual inspection of the data. This study identifies where and how specific care should be taken for the selection of parameters in the HMR package, which may contribute to standardizing the methodologies used worldwide for N2O flux calculations, supporting initiatives in which data from many studies need to be combined. Highlights The HMR package, an implementation of the Hutchinson &amp;amp; Mosier Regression, is a widely used software for trace gas flux calculation that provides a recommendation on the most appropriate regression method based on several criteria. New parameters in the updated HMR package constrains the use of nonlinear flux calculation and inclusion of outliers. The new parameters affect the cumulative emissions of N2O obtained with manual and automated chambers differently. We found that the choice of parameter values led to differences in cumulative N2O emissions of up to 67.3% This study identifies where and how specific care should be taken for the selection of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microorganisms play pivotal roles in soil processes. Metabolically related microorganisms constitute functional groups, and diverse microbial functional groups control nutrient cycling in soils. This study explored environmental (i.e., rainfall, temperature) and soil factors driving the distribution of bacterial functional groups involved in soil carbon (C) cycling in paired natural and agricultural ecosystems. Soil samples were collected at a regional scale covering gradients of temperature and rainfall across two orthogonal transects (similar to 1000 km) in New South Wales, Australia. Putative functions of bacteria were linked to two soil C fractions: particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC). We found: (i) temperature and rainfall were important drivers of bacterial functional groups, while soil properties, such as pH, soil C and nitrogen (N), also presented significant contributions; (ii) community structure of bacteria involved in C cycling was mainly related to POC content but not to MAOC; (iii) paired sampling showed that agricultural practices had significant impacts on the composition and responses of soil bacterial functional groups. This study demonstrated the environmental regulation (e.g., temperature and rainfall) of soil microbial functional groups at large scales, which was altered by agricultural practices.HighlightsSoil bacteria involved in C cycling were investigated across two similar to 1000 km transects.Temperature and rainfall were important drivers of bacterial functional groups at large scale.Paired sampling showed that agriculture led to a significant shift in bacterial functional groups.Community structure of bacterial functional groups were correlated with soil POC but not MAOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simulating-water-and-nitrogen-runoff-with-apsim&quot;&gt;Simulating water and nitrogen runoff with APSIM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the impact of potential reductions of terrain-targeted nitrogen (N) fertilisation rates on N losses a simulation study was carried out using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). To simulate N runoff a simple approach was used, in which runoff is based on the N concentration in the soil solution and an extraction coefficient. Firstly, APSIM parameters that have the largest effect on runoff of water and N were determined for terrains with different slopes for a poorly drained silt loam. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to assess the effect of soil hydraulic properties and soil organic carbon content on runoff losses. Finally, APSIM was set up to simulate pasture production and water and N dynamics (including pasture N uptake, leaching and N runoff) for a farm on rolling hills in South Canterbury, New Zealand. Two different fertilisation approaches were used, either scheduled or based on the aboveground N concentration of the pasture. For the poorly drained silt loam, the rainfall intensity and the surface conductance had the highest effect on the amount of water lost by runoff. Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation and field capacity, as well as plant available water content also controlled runoff of water and N, while the organic carbon content of the topsoil had less effect on N runoff. Both the extraction coefficient and the depth considered to exchange N with the runoff water affected the amount of N lost via runoff. Using the aboveground pasture N concentration prior to fertilisation had positive effects on pasture yield and reduced N runoff losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-empirical-model-for-prediction-of-topsoil-deformation-in-field-traffic&quot;&gt;An empirical model for prediction of topsoil deformation in field traffic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural topsoils are characterized by a heterogeneous mixture of structural units with a considerable difference in soil mechanical properties. Mechanistic modeling of compaction for this layer is challenging because of the need to parameterize model input parameters. This study quantified soil deformation during loading in semi-confined conditions and searched for drivers decisive for observed strains with no a priori assumptions of material properties. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in the plough layer of eleven sandy and loamy soils in Denmark. The samples were adjusted to either of the following matric potentials: -30, -50, -75, -100, -160 and -300 hPa (pF from-1.5 to-2.5). Cores at each water condition were loaded with an annulus covering one third of the soil surface at either of the following normal loads: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 kPa. Multiple regression was performed to estimate the best model describing the variation in soil compressibility. Measured strain, epsilon, decreased with increase in soil organic matter, bulk density and pF, but the effect of pF was affected by soil clay content. The model explained-84 % of the variation in data and predicted well measured strain for two independent data sets. The regression model is suggested for prediction of soil deformation of arable topsoils in field traffic. A procedure is described for the prediction, including calculation of the relevant stress based on loading characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reduced-co2-uptake-and-growing-nutrient-sequestration-from-slowing-overturning-circulation&quot;&gt;Reduced CO2 uptake and growing nutrient sequestration from slowing overturning circulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current Earth system models (ESMs) project dramatic slowing (28-42% by 2100) of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Southern Meridional Overturning Circulation (SMOC) across a range of climate scenarios, with a complete shutdown of SMOC possible by year 2300. Slowing meridional overturning circulation (MOC) differentially impacts the ocean biological and solubility carbon pumps, leaving the net impact on ocean carbon uptake uncertain. Here using a suite of ESMs, we show that slowing MOC reduces anthropogenic carbon uptake by the solubility pump but increases deep-ocean storage of carbon and nutrients by the biological pump. The net effect reduces ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2. The deep-ocean nutrient sequestration will increasingly depress global-scale, marine net primary production over time. MOC slowdown represents a positive feedback that could extend or intensify peak-warmth climate conditions on multi-century timescales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perspective-what-might-it-cost-to-reconfigure-food-systems&quot;&gt;Perspective: What might it cost to reconfigure food systems?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even an approximate estimate of the amount of investment required globally to reconfigure food systems for resilience and sustainability in the face of climate change could help to catalyse the urgent action that is needed. A report published in 2020 set out eleven actions that were identified as being needed to reconfigure food systems. Here we estimate the annual cost of implementing these eleven actions to be USD 1.3 +/- 0.1 trillion. Half of this is needed to halt conversion of forests and peatlands for agriculture, with the remainder used to reduce producer risk, lower emissions and strengthen the policy, finance and innovation enablers of change. This cost, though large, is equivalent to less than 7 percent of the negative externalities generated annually by current food systems. The costs of inaction will far outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financials-threaten-to-undermine-the-functioning-of-emissions-markets&quot;&gt;Financials threaten to undermine the functioning of emissions markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participation of financial actors is a key design issue in all emissions allowance markets. Although financials perform several necessary market functions, excessive speculation may undermine market functioning. The potential for harm is gaining prominence as tighter emission limits increasingly attract speculators and investors into allowance markets worldwide. However, adequate warning systems and tools to appraise the beneficial and detrimental facets of financial trading are wanting. We develop preliminary elements of a diagnostic toolbox to assess the scale and impacts of speculation and apply it to the EU emissions trading system. This Perspective seeks to inform current policy debates and invites further research to establish speculation-monitoring systems for allowance markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-incorporating-soil-in-the-life-cycle-assessment-procedure-to-improve-the-sustainability-of-agricultural-management&quot;&gt;The importance of incorporating soil in the life cycle assessment procedure to improve the sustainability of agricultural management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formidable ability of soil to store carbon has attracted an increasing number of studies, but few of them included soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration as part of a carbon balance assessment in the agroecosystem. This raises some interesting questions: 1) how orchards conversion increase soil capacity to mitigate the green-house gases (GHG) emissions by storing C? 2) can it be considered in life cycle assessment (LCA)? 3) can SOC pools and soil biochemical properties determination improve LCA interpretation? To answer these questions, this study selected a ten- and fifteen-years-old peach orchards, a twenty-years-old pear orchard, a thirty-years-old kiwi orchard in south-east part of Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), and a cereals’ field as reference. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 and 15-30 cm depths, and the SOC pool amounts (i.e., labile and recalcitrant) determined. LCA was used to estimate the GHG emissions (CO(2)eq) from the orchards. Results showed that the conversion from cereals to orchard production increased OC stock (+82 % on average) suggesting that orchards cultivation systems have the capacity to enrich soil organic matter. Fertilization had the greatest impact on CO(2)eq emission accounting for at least 40 % of total CO(2)eq emissions. Kiwi cultivation had the highest impact on GHG emissions mainly due to the high water and nutrient demand (0.045 and 0.149 kg CO(2)eq kg 1 fruit yr 1, respectively). When taking into account the C-CO(2)eq loss by fruit cultivation and C storage in soils, results would indicate that peach and pear orchard agroecosystems promote C sequestration. Conversely, kiwi cultivation showed large CO(2)eq emissions only partly counterbalanced by SOC sequestration. This study highlights the importance of including soils in LCA: if made mandatory this would allow a wider, yet more detailed, picture of the impact of agricultural practices on C budget. This simple step could help optimise resource management and at the same time improve agroecosystem sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-model-simulation-to-evaluate-soil-loss-potential-in-diversified-agricultural-landscapes&quot;&gt;Using model simulation to evaluate soil loss potential in diversified agricultural landscapes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural production is facing a challenging transition through changing political framework conditions and climate change. Innovative field use and land management through temporal and spatial diversification measures support the political efforts to achieve the European Green Deal. However, increasing precipitation intensities through climate change are leading to an increased risk of soil erosion by water. To mitigate such risk, soil erosion should be taken into account when redesigning fields and landscapes. This paper aims to assess the present erosion risk situation in the innovative on-farm field experiment “patchCROP “ with several implemented spatio-temporal crop diversification measures (field size, flower strips, crop rotation), using the physically-based Erosion 3D simulation model at the field scale. The modelling results showed that field reshaping from one large field into smaller field segments had the potential to reduce soil erosion. Flower strips reduced the sediment discharge to approximately half of that of small field segments without flower strips. However, as model results indicated, heterogeneous landscapes showed complex erosion and deposition patterns. To identify these, making use of physically based soil erosion models in new field arrangements is a critical future task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-texture-and-ph-affect-soil-co2-efflux-in-hardwood-floodplain-forests-of-the-lower-middle-elbe-river&quot;&gt;Soil texture and pH affect soil CO2 efflux in hardwood floodplain forests of the lower middle Elbe River&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floodplain ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon (C) cycle, particularly due to their C sink potential in hardwood floodplain forests. However, in these forests, interactions between a heterogeneous micro-relief and anthropogenic landscape changes make estimating C loss through soil CO2 efflux difficult. To determine the drivers of soil CO2 efflux, we selected six hardwood floodplain forests at the lower middle Elbe River, which were distributed among different relief positions (low-lying or high-elevated) in the active and former flooding zone. We measured soil CO2 effluxes over a full year using the closed-chamber method. Based on the response of soil CO2 efflux to soil moisture and temperature, annual efflux rates were determined, which were then related to soil properties, such as pH, texture, soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) content. Soil CO2 efflux ranged between 1006 (&amp;amp; PLUSMN;99) and 2214 (&amp;amp; PLUSMN;118) gC m(-2) year(-1). Maximum efflux occurred in a former floodplain forest that was disconnected from Elbe River water table fluctuations. SOC-specific soil CO2 efflux (gC gSOC(-1) year(-1)) was smallest in low-lying forests of the active flooding zone and reflected by the appearance of redoximorphic mottling close to the soil surface. Fine texture (&amp;lt; 6.3 mu m), SOC and N were related positively and electric conductivity, C/N and pH negatively to total soil CO2 efflux. Soil pH and fine texture were the strongest univariate predictors for total soil CO2 efflux (both R-2 = 0.59). Fine texture, pH and C/N ratio explained 66% of the variance in total soil CO2 efflux according to multiple linear regression. We conclude that, in hardwood floodplain forests, soil CO2 efflux is mainly controlled by fine texture and soil pH. Fine texture can be related to soil moisture and nutrient availability and may have a positive effect on the activity of microorganisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-bacterial-and-fungal-communities-show-within-field-heterogeneity-that-varies-by-land-management-and-distance-metric&quot;&gt;Soil bacterial and fungal communities show within field heterogeneity that varies by land management and distance metric&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing interest in the use of microbial metrics to evaluate soil health raises the issue of how fine-scale het-erogeneity can affect microbial community measurements. Here we analyse bacterial and fungal communities of over 100 soil samples across 17 pasture farms and evaluate beta diversity at different scales. We find large variation in microbial communities between different points in the same field, and if Aitchison distance is used we find that within-field variation is as high as between-farm variation. However, if Bray-Curtis or Jaccard distance are used this variation is partially explained by differences in soil pH and vegetation and is higher under mob grazing for fungi. Hence, field scale variation in microbial communities can impact the evaluation of soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-physical-method-for-downscaling-land-surface-temperatures-using-surface-energy-balance-theory&quot;&gt;A physical method for downscaling land surface temperatures using surface energy balance theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine-resolution land surface temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared remote sensing images is a good indicator of surface water status and plays an essential role in the exchange of energy and water between land and atmosphere. A physical surface energy balance (SEB)-based LST downscaling method (DTsEB) is developed to downscale coarse remotely sensed thermal infrared LST products with fine-resolution visible and near-infrared data. The DTsEB method is advantageous for its ability to mechanically interrelate surface variables contributing to the spatial variation of LST, to quantitatively weigh the contributions of each related variable within a physical framework, and to efficaciously avoid the subjective selection of scaling factors and the establishment of statistical regression relationships. The applicability of the DTsEB method was tested by downscaling 12 scenes of 990 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and aggregated Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LST products to 90 m resolution at six overpass times between 2005 and 2015 over three 9.9 km by 9.9 km cropland (mixed by grass, tree, and built-up land) study areas. Three typical LST downscaling methods, namely the widely applied TsHARP, the later developed least median square regression downscaling (LMS) and the geographically weighted regression (GWR), were introduced for inter comparison. The results showed that the DTsEB method could more effectively reconstruct the subpixel spatial variations in LST within the coarse-resolution pixels and achieve a better downscaling accuracy than the TsHARP, LMS and GWR methods. The DTsEB method yielded, on average, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.01 K and 1.42 K when applied to the MODIS datasets and aggregated ASTER datasets, respectively, which were lower than those obtained with the TsHARP method, with average RMSEs of 2.41 K and 1.71 K, the LMS method, with average RMSEs of 2.35 K and 1.63 K, and the GWR method, with average RMSEs of 2.38 K and 1.64 K, respectively. The contributions of the related surface variables to the subpixel spatial variation in the LST varied both spatially and temporally and were different from each other. In summary, the DTsEB method was demonstrated to outperform the TsHARP, LMS, and GWR methods and could be used as a good alternative for downscaling LST products from coarse to fine resolution with high robustness and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-alteration-of-soil-quality-degradation-and-resistance-indices-under-different-land-uses-through-network-and-factor-analysis&quot;&gt;Assessing alteration of soil quality, degradation, and resistance indices under different land uses through network and factor analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-increasing population and their needs necessitate sustainable use of soil and the other natural resources. In these circumstances land use changes may occur for supplying the food and settlement requirements of the increased population. Therefore, it is needed to evaluate and monitor quality and degradation of the soils. Recently, identification of appropriate soil quality (SQI) and degradation (SDI) indices for assessing sustainable use of soil resources has received increased attention. However, evaluation of quality, degradation, and resistance indices through various new approaches (e.g., network, NA and factor, FA analysis) particularly under different land uses to determine their susceptibility have been rarely conducted. The present study aimed to i) determine SQI, SDI, and resistance (SRI) indices NA and FA approaches under different land uses; ii) investigate the most influential attributes to soil quality (SQ); and iii) to compare SQIs obtained using two different Integrated (IQI) and Nemoro (NQI) Quality Indices, and indicator selection (Minimum Data Set, MDS and Total Data Set, TDS) approaches. Composite soil samples of cropland, forestland, and rangeland were collected and twentyone soil physicochemical and fertility indicators were measured. MDS was determined using principal component analysis (PCA). The SDI and SRI were computed and compared. Results revealed that the SDI was -13.8% and -4.6% for the cropland and rangeland, respectively indicating inappropriate soil managerial practices in cropland. SRI was 0.01 and 0.41 for the cropland and rangeland, respectively. The lowest SRI values were obtained for critical level of organic matter (CLOM), organic matter (OM), zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) showing that these properties, compared with the others, are more sensitive to land use change. Regression equations between SDI and SRI revealed that these substantial relationships show similar trends indicating that these are useful indices to determine SQ and evaluate the effect of land use change and managerial practices. Soils in cropland had a significantly lower deterioration index (DI) (-66.70) than that of the other land uses. SQI in the cropland was the lowest, especially when screened with the NA method. Furthermore, SQI showed the highest correlation with clay and CLOM. The linear SQI value derived from correlation-based-NA method showed greater max/min ratios than that of the FA. Therefore, the NA-based-SQI, as a novel statistical approach, would be more effective than the SQI-derived-FA for evaluating the effects of land use changes and managerial practices. In general, the mentioned technique is a relatively comprehensive approach integrating different influential soil indicators with various weights showing their contributions to soil quality or degradation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-soil-moisture-interface-of-multi-depth-change-over-time&quot;&gt;Interactive soil moisture interface of multi-depth change over time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimation of soil moisture throughout a crop root zone (nowcasting) is prone to spatial error, even when the time variable (forecasting) is removed. Measurement at discrete points in the field is now common using multi -depth sensors reporting at high temporal resolution, e.g.; every 15 or 60 min. The agricultural industry standard for data representation is suitable for prescriptive applications such as irrigation scheduling but is inadequate for descriptive applications such as reviewing change through a rainfed growing season. We developed an inter-active interface for animating past data and tested it on 61 EnviroPro (R) capacitance probes for up to 24 months starting mid 2019. Probes were installed in grey vertisol cropping soils of northern NSW, Australia, which contract when dry to produce deep cracks. When static, the interface highlights change in moisture at each level to the present date, with a default value of seven days. The interface shows these values against historical ex-tremes for the installation duration. When animated, the interface enables exploration of soil moisture change over one or more seasons by depth and crop phenology. We believe this descriptive use of data improves un-derstanding of crop-water relations, particularly for dryland crop production systems where management de-cisions are reliant on longer-term projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land-use-legacy-footprint-in-mediterranean-forest-soils-an-infrared-spectroscopy-approach&quot;&gt;Land use legacy footprint in Mediterranean forest soils: An infrared spectroscopy approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemical properties of forest soils can strongly influence this compartment vulnerability to climate change ef-fects. Past human activities can play a major role in structuring soil chemical properties. In the Mediterranean region, abandonment of terrace agriculture since 1860 induced the coexistence of forests with different ages. Here, soil chemical signature (SCS) was compared between very recent, recent and ancient forests using Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy and other chemical properties (total C and N, CaCO3 percentages). Land Use Legacy (LUL) effects were analysed depending on soil depths and on contrasted climate conditions (humid vs subhumid Mediterranean climates). Statistic treatments, Linear Mixed-Effect and Anova COMmon DIMension models, were used to highlight the influence of depth’s soil, climate and LUL effects. Interestingly, the soil depth did not influence LUL effect on soil spectra. The effect of climate, LUL and their interactions were observed on the SCS. Higher available N was observed in soils from ancient forests than in soils from very recent forests. Moreover, mineral fraction discriminated soils with different LUL (very recent vs recent and ancient forests) and this depended on climate. Under subhumid climate, soils from very recent forests were indeed negatively correlated with the mineral fraction, while under humid climate, they were positively correlated to it. Finally, a recovery of soils chemical properties was observed in recent forests under humid climate, while under subhumid climate, SCS of post agricultural forests was different from that of ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliable manipulation of soil organic matter (SOM) - a necessity for optimal land management - is constrained by our limited mechanistic understanding of SOM formation. Here we propose a novel mechanistic element that may contribute to SOM dynamics, supplementing existing frameworks, based on evolutionary-ecological rather than chemical or physical limitations to decomposition. We argue that decomposition of some substrates may be constrained by spatial competition from opportunists. We describe and test a mathematical model based on our framework, providing a proof-of-concept that substrate can, in principle, be spared decomposition and accumulate even when it is physically and chemically accessible. Our framework can help explain a variety of SOM dynamics, including priming and the suppression of decomposition by nitrogen addition, as well as the typical composition of SOM. An augmented mechanistic framework for understanding SOM dynamics can help guide targeted empirical study, which in turn can contribute to more optimised land management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;knowledge-is-power-where-digital-soil-mapping-needs-geopedology&quot;&gt;Knowledge Is Power: Where Digital Soil Mapping Needs Geopedology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of current digital soil mapping (DSM) practice relies on terrain, climate and remote sensing-derived covariates. These are easy to obtain and can serve as proxies to soil forming factors and from these to soil properties or classes. However, mapping of soil bodies, not properties in isolation, is what gives insight into the soil landscape. A naïve attempt at correlating environmental covariates will not succeed in the presence of unmapped variations in parent material, soil bodies and landforms inherited from past environments. It also takes no account of spatial relations among soil bodies. Geopedology integrates an understanding of the geomorphic conditions under which soils evolve with field observations. Examples where simplistic DSM would fail but geopedology would succeed in mapping and, even better, explaining the soil distribution are shown: exhumed paleosols, low-relief depositional environments, inverted landscapes, and recent post-glacial landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-soil-structure-affect-water-infiltration-a-meta-data-systematic-review&quot;&gt;How does soil structure affect water infiltration? A meta-data systematic review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil structure is a key attribute of soil quality and health that significantly impacts water infiltration. Structure can be significantly altered by natural or anthropogenic drivers including soil management practices and can in turn impact soil infiltration. Those changes in soil structure are often complex to quantify and can lead to conflicting impacts on water infiltration into soils. Here, we present a narrative systematic review (SR) of the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as defined methods for literature search and data extraction, our systematic review led to a total of 153 papers divided into two sets: experimental (131) and theoretical (22) papers. That implied a significant number of in-situ and field experiments that were conducted to assess the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration under the influence of different land uses and soil practices. Analysis of the metadata extracted from the collected papers revealed significant impacts of soil structure on water infiltration. Those effects were further attributed to land use and management, where we demonstrate the impact of three unique categories: soil amendments, crop management and tillage. Furthermore, significant correlations were established between infiltration rate and soil structural properties, with R2 values ranging from 0.51 to 0.80 and for saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil structural properties, with R2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.78. Finally, our review highlighted the significant absence of and the need for theoretical frameworks studying the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-modelling-predictions-show-high-uncertainty-of-required-carbon-input-changes-to-reach-a-4-parts-per-thousand-target&quot;&gt;Multi-modelling predictions show high uncertainty of required carbon input changes to reach a 4 parts per thousand target&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils store vast amounts of carbon (C) on land, and increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in already managed soils such as croplands may be one way to remove C from the atmosphere, thereby limiting subsequent warming. The main objective of this study was to estimate the amount of additional C input needed to annually increase SOC stocks by 4%(0) at 16 long-term agricultural experiments in Europe, including exogenous organic matter (EOM) additions. We used an ensemble of six SOC models and ran them under two configurations: (1) with default parametrization and (2) with parameters calibrated site-by-site to fit the evolution of SOC stocks in the control treatments (without EOM). We compared model simulations and analysed the factors generating variability across models. The calibrated ensemble was able to reproduce the SOC stock evolution in the unfertilised control treatments. We found that, on average, the experimental sites needed an additional 1.5 +/- 1.2 Mg C ha(-)(1) year(-1) to increase SOC stocks by 4%(0) per year over 30 years, compared to the C input in the control treatments (multi-model median +/- median standard deviation across sites). That is, a 119% increase compared to the control. While mean annual temperature, initial SOC stocks and initial C input had a significant effect on the variability of the predicted C input in the default configuration (i.e., the relative standard deviation of the predicted C input from the mean), only water-related variables (i.e., mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) explained the divergence between models when calibrated. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks in agriculture and accentuates the need to increasingly lean on multi-model ensembles when predicting SOC stock trends and related processes. To increase the reliability of SOC models under future climate change, we suggest model developers to better constrain the effect of water-related variables on SOC decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applications-of-computed-tomography-ct-in-environmental-soil-and-plant-sciences&quot;&gt;Applications of Computed Tomography (CT) in environmental soil and plant sciences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computed tomography (CT) in combination with advanced image processing can be used to non-invasively and non-destructively visualize complex interiors of living and non-living media in 2 and 3-dimensional space. In addition to medical applications, CT has also been widely used in soil and plant science for visual and quanti-tative descriptions of physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes. The technique has been used successfully on numerous applications. However, with a rapidly evolving CT technologies and expanding ap-plications, a renewed review is desirable. Only a few attempts have been made to collate and review examples of CT applications involving the integrated field of soil and plant research in recent years. Therefore, the objectives of this work were to: (1) briefly introduce the basic principles of CT and image processing; (2) identify the research status and hot spots of CT using bibliometric analysis based on Web of Science literature over the past three decades; (3) provide an overall review of CT applications in soil science for measuring soil properties (e.g., porous soil structure, soil components, soil biology, heat transfer, water flow, and solute transport); and (4) give an overview of applications of CT in plant science to detect morphological structures, plant material properties, and root-soil interaction. Moreover, the limitations of CT and image processing are discussed and future per-spectives are given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soils-in-warmer-and-less-developed-countries-have-less-micronutrients-globally&quot;&gt;Soils in warmer and less developed countries have less micronutrients globally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil micronutrients are capital for the delivery of ecosystem functioning and food provision worldwide. Yet, despite their importance, the global biogeography and ecological drivers of soil micronutrients remain virtually unknown, limiting our capacity to anticipate abrupt unexpected changes in soil micronutrients in the face of climate change. Here, we analyzed &amp;gt;1300 topsoil samples to examine the global distribution of six metallic micronutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Co and Ni) across all continents, climates and vegetation types. We found that warmer arid and tropical ecosystems, present in the least developed countries, sustain the lowest contents of multiple soil micronutrients. We further provide evidence that temperature increases may potentially result in abrupt and simultaneous reductions in the content of multiple soil micronutrients when a temperature threshold of 12-14 degrees C is crossed, which may be occurring on 3% of the planet over the next century. Altogether, our findings provide fundamental understanding of the global distribution of soil micronutrients, with direct implications for the maintenance of ecosystem functioning, rangeland management and food production in the warmest and poorest regions of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effects-of-land-clearing-for-agriculture-on-soil-organic-carbon-stocks-in-drylands-a-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;Effects of land clearing for agriculture on soil organic carbon stocks in drylands: A meta-analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural activities have been expanding globally with the pressure to provide food security to the earth’s growing population. These agricultural activities have profoundly impacted soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in global drylands. However, the effects of clearing natural ecosystems for cropland (CNEC) on SOC are uncertain. To improve our understanding of carbon emissions and sequestration under different land uses, it is necessary to characterize the response patterns of SOC stocks to different types of CNEC. We conducted a meta-analysis with mixed-effect model based on 873 paired observations of SOC in croplands and adjacent natural ecosystems from 159 individual studies in global drylands. Our results indicate that CNEC significantly (p &amp;lt; .05) affects SOC stocks, resulting from a combination of natural land clearing, cropland management practices (fertilizer application, crop species, cultivation duration) and the significant negative effects of initial SOC stocks. Increases in SOC stocks (in 1 m depth) were found in croplands which previously natural land (deserts and shrublands) had low SOC stocks, and the increases were 278.86% (95% confidence interval, 196.43%-361.29%) and 45.38% (26.53%-62.23%), respectively. In contrast, SOC stocks (in 1 m depth) decreased by 24.11% (18.38%-29.85%) and 10.70% (1.80%-19.59%) in clearing forests and grasslands for cropland, respectively. We also established the general response curves of SOC stocks change to increasing cultivation duration, which is crucial for accurately estimating regional carbon dynamics following CNEC. SOC stocks increased significantly (p &amp;lt; .05) with high long-term fertilizer consumption in cleared grasslands with low initial SOC stocks (about 27.2 Mg ha(-1)). The results derived from our meta-analysis could be used for refining the estimation of dryland carbon dynamics and developing SOC sequestration strategies to achieve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-effects-of-global-change-drivers-as-determinants-of-the-link-between-soil-biodiversity-and-ecosystem-functioning&quot;&gt;Interactive effects of global change drivers as determinants of the link between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biodiversity, both aboveground and belowground, is negatively affected by global changes such as drought or warming. This loss of biodiversity impacts Earth’s ecosystems, as there is a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF). Even though soils host a large fraction of biodiversity that underlies major ecosystem functions, studies exploring the relationship between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (sBEF) as influenced by global change drivers (GCDs) remain scarce. Here we highlight the need to decipher sBEF relationships under the effect of interactive GCDs that are intimately connected in a changing world. We first state that sBEF relationships depend on the type of function (e.g., C cycling or decomposition) and biodiversity facet (e.g., abundance, species richness, or biomass) considered. Then, we shed light on the impact of single and interactive GCDs on soil biodiversity and sBEF and show that results from scarce studies studying interactive effects range from antagonistic to additive to synergistic when two individual GCDs cooccur. This indicates the need for studies quantitatively accounting for the impacts of interactive GCDs on sBEF relationships. Finally, we provide guidelines for optimized methodological and experimental approaches to study sBEF in a changing world that will provide more valuable information on the real impact of (interactive) GCDs on sBEF. Together, we highlight the need to decipher the sBEF relationship in soils to better understand soil functioning under ongoing global changes, as changes in sBEF are of immediate importance for ecosystem functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-acidity-amelioration-improves-n-and-c-cycles-in-the-short-term-in-a-system-with-soybean-followed-by-maize-guinea-grass-intercropping&quot;&gt;Soil acidity amelioration improves N and C cycles in the short term in a system with soybean followed by maize-guinea grass intercropping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lime application has been associated with N and C losses from agricultural systems through NO3- leaching, N2O and CO2 emissions. However, we hypothesized that in an intensive crop system where soybean is grown in rotation with maize intercropped with a forage grass, liming associated with the application of gypsum to ameliorate the subsoil, and N fertilization increase soil N and C by improving root and crop growth. To evaluate the interaction of lime, gypsum and N fertilizer on soil and N and C partial balances, an experiment was carried out under no-till, where soybean was grown in rotation with maize intercropped with Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv Tanzania) as relay crop. Lime and gypsum were applied before soybean planting in October 2016 and October 2017. Two N rates (0 and 160 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of N as ammonium sulphate) were applied to maize annually. Outputs through N-NO3- leaching, N-N2O emission and N-NH3 volatilization did not exceed 30 kg ha(-1) of N in two years. The N exported in grains consisted in 96% of the N output and was greater with fertilizer and lime. Soil acidity amelioration and N-fertilization favoured soil C fixation with high plant biomass production (C in plant residue, roots, and grains), while soil C-CO2 emission was not affected, and soil C increased. Although the partial N balance was negative, there was an increase in soil N, probably due to biological N fixation by soybean, which was not considered in the partial balance. We concluded that lime and gypsum application, along with an adequate N fertilization, to a tropical highly-weathered soil with soybean cropped in rotation with maize-guinea grass intercropping benefit N and C cycles and the environment in the short-term, increasing soil N and C stocks and reducing GHG emitted to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feasibility-assessment-on-use-of-proximal-geophysical-sensors-to-support-precision-management&quot;&gt;Feasibility assessment on use of proximal geophysical sensors to support precision management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study was conducted at three sites in North Dakota to strengthen understanding of the usefulness of different proximal geophysical data types in agricultural contexts of varying pedology. This study hypothesizes that electromagnetic induction (EMI), gamma-ray sensor (GRS), cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS), and elevation data layers are all useful in multiple linear regression (MLR) predictions of soil properties that meet expert criteria at three agricultural sites. In addition to geophysical data collection with vehicle-mounted sensors, 15 soil samples were collected at each site and analyzed for nine soil properties of interest. A set of model training data was compiled by pairing the sampled soil property measurements with the nearest geophysical data. Eleven models passed expert-defined uncertainty criteria at Site 1, 16 passed at Site 2, and 14 passed at Site 3. Electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM), available water holding capacity, silt, and clay were predicted at Site 1 with an R-squared of prediction (Rpred2)$(R_{pred}&amp;lt;^&amp;gt;2)$ &amp;gt; .50 and acceptable root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). Bulk density (BD), OM, available water capacity, silt, and clay were predicted with Rpred2$R_{pred}&amp;lt;^&amp;gt;2$ &amp;gt; .50 and acceptable RMSEP at Site 2. At Site 3, no soil properties were predicted with acceptable RMSEP and an Rpred2$R_{pred}&amp;lt;^&amp;gt;2$ &amp;gt; .50. These results confirm feasibility of our method, and the authors recommend the prioritization of EMI data collection if geophysical data collection is limited to a single mapping effort and calibration soil samples are few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods-for-downhole-soil-water-sensor-calibration-complications-of-bulk-density-and-water-content-variations&quot;&gt;Methods for downhole soil water sensor calibration-Complications of bulk density and water content variations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downhole soil volumetric water content (VWC) sensors are used in access tubes to assess the soil water content at multiple depths. If sensor readings are spaced closely enough vertically and are accurate enough, then accurate soil profile water content storage and change in storage can be determined over the depth range of readings, leading to accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) if readings extend to well below the root zone. Even if sensing only covers the active root zone, soil water depletion may be determined well enough to inform irrigation scheduling. While sensor accuracy is dependent on many factors, including the sensor’s physical principle of operation, soil-specific calibration is typically required for good accuracy. In soils with multiple horizons (layers) of different texture, bulk density (BD), or chemical composition, horizon-specific calibrations may be necessary. We describe methods and equipment used for downhole sensor calibration to typical accuracy of &amp;lt;0.01 m(3) m(-3) with specific reference to calibration of 10 neutron scattering meters in a soil that required three different horizon-specific calibrations. Our results contrast with the factory calibration, which would result in a 38-mm error in water stored in a 1.5-m deep profile of our soil. We describe variability of measured VWC and BD with depth, distance, and water content and the errors that result from using BD to convert mass basis (g g(-1)) water content data to VWC data, which can be as much as 35 mm (7.26% underestimation) for soil water storage in a 1.5-m deep profile of our soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-carbon-isotopic-composition-delta-c-13-as-a-proxy-of-organic-matter-dynamics-in-soils-on-the-western-shore-of-lake-baikal&quot;&gt;Stable Carbon Isotopic Composition (delta C-13) as a Proxy of Organic Matter Dynamics in Soils on the Western Shore of Lake Baikal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the main factors that control carbon dynamics in soils is an urgent problem in the context of modern climate change. The analysis of stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) composition is one of the approaches to understanding this dynamics. The study was carried out in the landscapes of the southeastern slope and foothills of the Primorskii Range, characterized by contrasting physico-geographical conditions. Climatic parameters, spatial variations in the composition of stable carbon isotopes and their distribution in soil profiles, and soil physicochemical properties controlling carbon dynamics have been analyzed. The soil humus horizons formed in mountainous tundra and steppe landscapes manifest the highest delta C-13 values (-24.72 and -23.97 … -24.75 parts per thousand ); whereas the lowest (-25.61 … -27.18 parts per thousand ) values are registered in the mountainous taiga soils. Based on the calculation of linear dependence between delta C-13 values and the total carbon content in soil, which varies with the depth, the carbon turnover intensity was determined using the slope of linear regression. It was revealed that under the contrasting conditions of mountainous tundra and steppe landscapes, the climate (deficiency of heat and moisture) has a significant impact on the intensity of organic matter transformation, blocking the effect of edaphic (soil profile) factors. Under more favorable climatic conditions of mountainous taiga landscapes, the dynamics of organic matter in soils is controlled mainly by edaphic factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fraser-island-kgari-and-initiation-of-the-great-barrier-reef-linked-by-middle-pleistocene-sea-level-change&quot;&gt;Fraser Island (K’gari) and initiation of the Great Barrier Reef linked by Middle Pleistocene sea-level change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eastern Australia coastline is characterized by impressive coastal landforms and an extensive northward-moving longshore drift system that have been influenced by a stable, long-term tectonic history over the Quaternary period. However, the timing and drivers of the formation of two conspicuous landscape features-Fraser Island (K’gari) and the Great Barrier Reef-remain poorly understood. Here we use optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating to constrain the formation of the extensive dunes that make up Fraser Island, the world’s largest sand island, and adjacent Cooloola Sand Mass in southeastern Queensland. We find that both formed between 1.2 Ma and 0.7 Ma, during a global climate reconfiguration across the Middle Pleistocene transition. They formed as a direct result of increased amplitude of sea-level fluctuations associated with increasing global ice volume that redistributed previously stored sediment across the continental shelf. The development of Fraser Island dramatically reduced sediment supply to the continental shelf north of the island. This facilitated widespread coral reef formation in the southern and central Great Barrier Reef and was a necessary precondition for its development. This major reorganization of the coastal sedimentary system is probably not unique to eastern Australia and should be investigated in other passive-margin coastlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption of sediment flows along the eastern Australia coast due to the Middle Pleistocene formation of Fraser Island set the stage for Great Barrier Reef initiation, according to optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating of sand dunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variability-of-phosphorus-sorption-properties-in-hydromorphic-soils-consequences-for-p-losses-in-agricultural-landscapes&quot;&gt;Variability of phosphorus sorption properties in hydromorphic soils: Consequences for P losses in agricultural landscapes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing concerns over water eutrophication due to agricultural phosphorus (P) loss have led to the development of indicators to assess the risk of P release from agricultural soils. Recently, a logarithmic equation linking the degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS) to the simple water-soluble P (WSP) content of soils has been proposed as a universal method to assess this risk based, however, mainly on the analysis of well-drained soils. Here, we studied the P sorption properties and DPS values of 69 hydromorphic soils from cultivated and uncultivated wetland zones located in Brittany, Western France, to test whether the method could also apply to poorly-drained soils. The bulk soil analysis showed that P contents of the studied hydromorphic soils were 30% to 80% higher than P contents normally found in Brittany soils, evidencing a possible P enrichment process. Adsorption isotherms revealed a surprisingly high variability in the P sorption properties as a function of the location of the soil (maximum P adsorption capacity ranging from 500 to 1850 mg kg(-1)), which is caused by variations in the phases controlling P sorption in soil (from clay to organic matter and/or iron and aluminium oxides, depending on the soil location). Distinct relationships between DPS and WSP values were also obtained depending on the location of the soils. The obtained DPS versus WSP relationships showed that the P saturation threshold above which the risk of dissolved P release increases markedly is 30% lower on average for hydromorphic soils than for well-drained soils. Hydromorphic soils appear to be more at risk of releasing dissolved P at the same DPS values than well-drained soils. The present study indicates an underestimation of the P release risk from hydromorphic soils by the existing method developed for well-drained soils and calls for the development of specific risk assessment tools for hydromorphic soils, especially given on the strong spatial heterogeneity of their P sorption properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-web-based-system-for-satellite-based-high-resolution-global-soil-moisture-maps&quot;&gt;A web-based system for satellite-based high-resolution global soil moisture maps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, a wide range of applications require near-real-time Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) data at high spatial resolution. However, operational passive microwave systems like SMOS and SMAP can only acquire such information at a relatively coarser resolution. Therefore, several downscaling algorithms have been developed to address this issue and provide SSM maps at a finer spatial scale. Users may, however, find it difficult to implement the downscaling algorithm due to the complexity of integrating various data sources. Disaggregation based on Physical and Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) is one of the algorithms that is widely accepted to downscale passive microwave SSM observations. But the complexity of modeling, the variety of data sources and formats of input data make it very difficult for users to implement the algorithm. Thus, we developed a Satellitebased Hydrological Monitoring System (SHMS), which facilitates this gap through the implementation of the DisPATCh algorithm to generate large-scale SSM maps with high resolution, which is achieved by combining SMAP and MODIS products. The System Usability Scale (SUS) method was used to evaluate the system’s strengths and weaknesses. The SUS evaluation results show that 74.75% of SHMS users are satisfied with the system’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benchmarking-downscaled-satellite-based-soil-moisture-products-using-sparse-point-scale-ground-observations&quot;&gt;Benchmarking downscaled satellite-based soil moisture products using sparse, point-scale ground observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While strides have been made in their accuracy and availability, the overall utility of satellite-derived surface soil moisture (SM) datasets derived from passive microwave radiometry is still reduced by their relatively coarse spatial resolution (typically &amp;gt;30 km). In response to this shortcoming, many independent satellite-based SM downscaling approaches have been introduced recently. However, owing to limitations in the spatial sampling characteristics of existing SM ground-monitoring networks, it has proven difficult to obtain reliable reference SM observations at the target downscaling resolution for these approaches (typically 1 to 10 km). As a result, the objective evaluation of SM downscaling approaches is often challenging and/or limited to very localized conditions. Here, we introduce and evaluate a point-scale downscaling (PSD) benchmarking strategy whereby spatially sparse, long-term, point-scale SM observations available from existing ground-based SM networks are utilized for the objective benchmarking of downscaled satellite-based SM products. First, we define criteria that must be met for a given SM downscaling strategy to add either temporal accuracy or spatial skill relative to its coarse-resolution SM baseline. Next, we illustrate, both analytically and numerically, that such criteria can be accurately evaluated using sparse, point-scale SM observations available from existing ground-based SM networks. Finally, we apply our new PSD benchmarking approach to evaluate existing fine-scale SM products. Results demonstrate that the PSD approach, in concert with existing ground-based network data, can be leveraged to robustly evaluate SM downscaling approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warming-reduces-global-agricultural-production-by-decreasing-cropping-frequency-and-yields&quot;&gt;Warming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual food caloric production is the product of caloric yield, cropping frequency (CF, number of production seasons per year) and cropland area. Existing studies have largely focused on crop yield, whereas how CF responds to climate change remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the global climate sensitivity of caloric yields and CF at national scale. We find a robust negative association between warming and both caloric yield and CF. By the 2050s, projected CF increases in cold regions are offset by larger decreases in warm regions, resulting in a net global CF reduction (-4.2 +/- 2.5% in high emission scenario), suggesting that climate-driven decline in CF will exacerbate crop production loss and not provide climate adaptation alone. Although irrigation is effective in offsetting the projected production loss, irrigation areas have to be expanded by &amp;gt;5% in warm regions to fully offset climate-induced production losses by the 2050s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change will impact agriculture, and this study shows cropping frequency and caloric yield are negatively impacted on the global scale by warming. While cold regions will increase cropping frequency, warm regions will see greater decreases, resulting in an overall decline in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tipping-points-of-marine-phytoplankton-to-multiple-environmental-stressors&quot;&gt;Tipping points of marine phytoplankton to multiple environmental stressors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors establish machine learning models to identify multifactor tipping points of global marine phytoplankton. They show that temperature and carbon dioxide dominate risks, and project crossing tipping points in tropical area production (50%) and resistance (41%) by 2100 under high emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, anthropogenic climate change is threatening marine species. However, whether and how global marine phytoplankton, which represent the base of marine food webs, will exceed their tipping points under multiple climate factors remain unclear. Here, by establishing machine learning models, we identified the tipping points of global marine phytoplankton production and resistance under eight environmental stressors. Phytoplankton production and resistance are affected by multiple factors and the temperature and partial pressure of carbon dioxide dominate the risks for reaching their tipping points. If the current emission scenario continues, 50% (40-61% at 90% confidence) and 41% (2-80% at 90% confidence) of tropical areas would reach the tipping points of ongoing phytoplankton production and resistance decline, respectively, in 2100. Compared with single- or few-factor studies, machine learning (for example, ensemble machine learning) provides a powerful and realistic solution for policy-makers facing large-scale ecological responses to global climate changes under multiple environmental stressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fusion-of-gamma-rays-and-portable-x-ray-fluorescence-spectral-data-to-measure-extractable-potassium-in-soils&quot;&gt;Fusion of Gamma-rays and portable X-ray fluorescence spectral data to measure extractable potassium in soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detection and mapping of plant-extractable potassium (K-a) using proximal soil sensing and data fusion (DF) techniques are essential to optimise K2O fertiliser application, improve crop yield, and minimise environmental and financial costs. This work evaluates the potential of combined use of portable gamma ray and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy for in field detection and mapping of K-a. After subjected to various pre-processing methods, spectral data were split into calibration (75%) and validation (25%) sets, and single sensor and DF models were developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR). Maps of Ka were used to present spatial variability of potassium across an 8.4 ha Voor de Hoeves target field, in Flanders, Belgium. Results showed that the gamma-ray PLSR model using wet soils had greater predictive ability with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.71, ratio of performance deviation (RPD) = 1.89, root mean square error (RMSE) = 31.7 mg kg(-1), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) = 2.36 than the corresponding wet-XRF PLSR model (R-2 = 0.61, RPD = 1.64, RMSE = 48.8 mg kg(-1) and RPIQ = 1.84). The DF PLSR model on wet soils, resulted in a more accurate Ka predictive ability (R-2 = 0.75, RPD = 2.03, RMSE = 31.3 mg kg(-1) and RPIQ = 2.79), compared to the individual gamma ray or XRF sensors in wet soils. The best accuracy was obtained with XRF spectrometer using dry samples (R-2 = 0.77, RPD = 2.14, RMSE = 26.5 mg kg(-1) and RPIQ = 3.39). All Ka prediction maps showed spatial similarity to the corresponding measured maps in the target field. In conclusion, since DF increased the Ka prediction accuracy compared to the single sensor models using wet soils, it is recommended to be adopted in future studies as a potential solution for Ka measurement, mapping, and ultimately for site-specific K2O fertilisation management. The XRF analysis of dry spectra is recommended as the best method for accurate measurement of K-a.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-driving-factors-and-buffering-mechanism-regulating-cropland-soil-acidification-across-the-sichuan-basin-of-china&quot;&gt;The driving factors and buffering mechanism regulating cropland soil acidification across the Sichuan Basin of China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cropland soil has a higher acidification risk, with the driving factors and the soil buffering capacity controlling the degree of soil acidification. However, the relative importance of the main driving factors at broad geographic scales remains unclear, and the evidence on the acid-buffering process is rarely examined by large-scale observations. Using 4101 soil samples obtained in 1980s and 4348 soil samples collected in 2010s, this study explored topsoil pH changes of cropland across the Sichuan Basin of China and identified the relative importance of the main affecting factors. The results showed that topsoil pH (20 cm) has decreased by an average of 0.30 units (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Spatially, soil pH decline mainly occurred in the periphery of the Sichuan Basin where the initial pH (1980s) were less than 7.5. The magnitudes of soil pH decline were positively correlated with precipitation, base cation removal by crops and nitrogen fertilizer rates. Precipitation was identified as the most important factor in driving soil acidification. Moreover, the soil pH decrease was primarily buffered by soil carbonates and secondarily by soil CEC, and this study identified a critical level of 36.76 g kg(-1) for soil carbonates, above which the acid-buffering capacity was mainly provided by soil carbonates, otherwise by soil CEC. These findings emphasize the importance of formulating precipitation-based optimizing agronomic management practices for preventing or mitigating cropland soil acidification, and also provide a regional observation-dependent evidence for the changing acid-buffering process during the soil acidification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-microbiome-signatures-are-associated-with-pesticide-residues-in-arable-landscapes&quot;&gt;Soil microbiome signatures are associated with pesticide residues in arable landscapes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pesticides are widely applied in agriculture to combat disease, pests, and weeds, leading to long-lasting contamination of agricultural soils with pesticide residues. While classical risk assessment experiments have repeatedly addressed immediate pesticide effects, we employ an ecological approach to investigate how pesticide residues persisting in soils influence the soil microbiome under realistic agricultural conditions. We assessed a wide range of soil characteristics, including the occurrence of 48 widely-used pesticides in 60 fields under conventional, no-tillage and organic management. We then tested which factors best explain soil microbiome traits. Environmental factors, including climate, geography, and soil characteristics, were the soil microbiome’s leading drivers. Remarkably, of all management factors, pesticide residues showed the strongest associations with soil microbiome traits, which were even more pronounced than the effects of cropping systems. Pesticide residues were almost exclusively positively associated with the relative abundance of 113 bacterial and 130 fungal taxa, many of them being assigned to taxa of known pesticide degraders. While fungal diversity and abundance were primarily positively associated with pesticide residues, bacterial diversity and abundance of the gene nifH -essential for biological nitrogen fixation -were negatively linked to the concentration of individual pesticide residues. Our results suggest that pesticide residues alter the soil microbiome, with potential long-term implications for the functioning of agricultural soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrating-scientific-knowledge-into-machine-learning-using-interactive-decision-trees&quot;&gt;Integrating scientific knowledge into machine learning using interactive decision trees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision Trees (DT) describe a type of machine learning method that has been widely used in the geosciences to automatically extract patterns from complex and high dimensional data. However, like any data-based method, the application of DT is hindered by data limitations, such as significant biases, leading to potentially physically unrealistic results. We develop interactive DT (iDT) that put humans in the loop to integrate the power of experts’ scientific knowledge with the power of the algorithms to automatically learn patterns from large datasets. We created an open-source Python toolbox that implements the iDT framework. Users can interactively create new composite variables, change the variable and threshold to split, prune and group variables based on their physical meaning. We demonstrate with three case studies how iDT overcomes problems with current DT thus achieving higher interpretability and robustness of the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enigmatic-annular-landform-on-a-miocene-planar-karst-surface-nullarbor-plain-australia&quot;&gt;Enigmatic annular landform on a Miocene planar karst surface, Nullarbor Plain, Australia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nullarbor Plain is a similar to 200,000 km(2) planar karst surface in southern Australia, underlain by Cenozoic shallow-water limestones. During the Miocene the area was uplifted, and although the plain is generally considered extremely flat, locally, the geomorphology of the Nullarbor Plain retains evidence of earth surface processes across a long, middle Miocene-to-present time span. The accessibility of the recent 0.4 arc-second TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) by the German Aerospace Centre motivated the search for other possible fine-scale landforms that would previously have been unresolvable. The analysis of DEM images revealed an enigmatic annular landform with an outer diameter between 1200 m and 1300 m. It consists of a circular elevated rim and a central dome. Its morphology is distinct from other landforms observed on the plain, and cannot be readily explained as a part of known active or inferred/expected processes on the plain (e.g., fluvial, aeolian, karst, tectonic or extra-terrestrial impact processes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent karst processes (dayas formation) overprinting the landform indicates the presence of the annular structure prior to dayas formation. A unique microbial boundstone facies sampled from the bed-rock of the annular structure supports an interpretation of long-lived, at least partial retention of a primary depositional structure. Differential carbonate deposition, especially bioherm growth, was a likely origin of the annular topographical expression of the present-day landform and is comparable to biogenic structures in the modern day deeper Great Barrier Reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-carbon-storage-in-urban-vegetation-progress-challenges-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;Modeling carbon storage in urban vegetation: Progress, challenges, and opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urban vegetation (UV) and its carbon storage capacity are critical for terrestrial carbon cycling and global sustainable development goals (SDGs). With complex spatial distribution, composition and ecological functions, UV is essential for global carbon cycling and climate change. Therefore, improving UV carbon storage capacity modeling is a research hotspot that deserves extensive investigation. However, the uniqueness of UV lead to great challenges in carbon storage modeling, including (1) limitations in data and algorithms due to complex and sensitive urban environments; (2) the severe scarcity of in-city field observation data (e.g., EC towers and field surveys); (3) difficulty in parameter inversion (e.g., canopy height, LAI, etc.); (4) poor transferability when migrating estimation models from natural vegetation to urban scenarios. The progress in carbon storage modeling in urban settings is reviewed, with detailed discussions on carbon storage modeling methods and major challenges. We then propose strategies to overcome existing challenges, including (1) implementing novel and improved remote sensing (RS) techniques (e.g., hyper-spectral, LiDAR, carbon satellites, etc.) to obtain enhanced structural and functional information on UV; (2) improving critical nodes of the earth observation sensor network, especially the distribution of EC towers in urban settings; (3) leveraging “Model-Data Fusion” tech-nology by integrating big earth data with carbon estimation models to reduce the uncertainty in UV carbon storage estimations. This review provides new insights for modeling UV carbon storage and is expected to help the research community to achieve a better understanding of UV towards carbon neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-radiometric-accuracy-of-the-8-band-multi-spectral-surface-reflectance-from-the-planet-superdove-constellation&quot;&gt;The radiometric accuracy of the 8-band multi-spectral surface reflectance from the planet SuperDove constellation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in the capabilities of commercial CubeSat constellations have enabled the retrieval of multi-spectral surface reflectance data over the Earth’s terrestrial surfaces on an almost daily basis. For example, while the earliest versions of Planet’s CubeSats provided tri-band and then quad-band optical image data, the most recent iterations deliver imaging capabilities with eight unique spectral bands for Earth system monitoring. To determine the utility of these rich geospatial data collections for a range of applications, it is necessary to characterise their radiometric accuracy. Leveraging on-ground spectroradiometer measurements of radiometrically pseudoinvariant features, we assess the absolute accuracy of an annual sequence of Planet SuperDove surface reflectance data. Date-coincident and spectrally overlapping Sentinel-2 image data were also used to assess the relative radiometric accuracy of the CubeSat reflectance data. Additionally, confidence levels for acquiring consistent SuperDove surface reflectance data were calculated, and the multi-temporal patterns of surface reflectance between the SuperDove and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products were evaluated by examining their rank correlation. Our findings demonstrate that (1) the average accuracy of the Coastal-Blue, Blue, Green I, and Green II SuperDove surface reflectance bands was 5% higher than for the Yellow, Red, Red-Edge, and Near-Infrared bands; (2) the SuperDove surface reflectance data was on average almost identical to the surface reflectance derived from the coincident Sentinel-2 data; and (3) the radiometric accuracies (i.e., mean errors) can be improved by using band combinations (e.g. normalised difference vegetation index). However, due to the different radiometric performance between the spectral bands, some vegetation indices (e.g. the Yellowness Index) did not provide a linear relationship between the SuperDove and reference data. The probability of acquiring surface reflectance data with less than 5% reflectance variation was approximately 90% for the annual multi-satellite dataset. On average, 68% of the data derived from a single satellite had at least 95% probability of acquiring surface reflectance with less than 5% variation. The time series patterns of the SuperDove reflectance data had an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.67 for all types of surface units and 0.77 for vegetated surfaces when compared with the spectrally overlapping bands of the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. In addition to providing confidence levels for users to directly assess the radiometric accuracies of SuperDove surface reflectance products, we also provide suggestions to improve the data quality from an end-user’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-conceptual-framework-to-integrate-biodiversity-ecosystem-function-and-ecosystem-service-models&quot;&gt;A Conceptual Framework to Integrate Biodiversity, Ecosystem Function, and Ecosystem Service Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global biodiversity and ecosystem service models typically operate independently. Ecosystem service projections may therefore be overly optimistic because they do not always account for the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecological functions. We review models used in recent global model intercomparison projects and develop a novel model integration framework to more fully account for the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function, a key gap for linking biodiversity changes to ecosystem services. We propose two integration pathways. The first uses empirical data on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to bridge biodiversity and ecosystem function models and could currently be implemented globally for systems and taxa with sufficient data. We also propose a trait-based approach involving greater incorporation of biodiversity into ecosystem function models. Pursuing both approaches will provide greater insight into biodiversity and ecosystem services projections. Integrating biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem service modeling will enhance policy development to meet global sustainability goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-the-fusion-of-global-soil-moisture-datasets-from-smap-smos-ascat-and-merra2-by-considering-the-non-zero-error-covariance&quot;&gt;Improving the fusion of global soil moisture datasets from SMAP, SMOS, ASCAT, and MERRA2 by considering the non-zero error covariance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates from different sources have distinct error characteristics. Multi-source data combination is an efficient way to obtain improved SSM data with reduced uncertainties. Previous data merging studies based on the linear weight averaging scheme rarely considered the impacts of data error covariance (EC) and usually needed a reference dataset, which can lead to suboptimal merging weights. This study applied the quadruple collocation (QC) to estimate EC and combine four SSM datasets simultaneously without the need for a reference. Specifically, two passive microwave satellite datasets (the L3 Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-V7 and the L3 Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity-INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC)-V2), one active microwave dataset from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and one model dataset from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA2) were combined. Generally, QC-based data combination reduced SSM data uncertainties with significantly reduced unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) scores against in situ observations and globally decreased fMSE scores. Moreover, in situ evaluation showed that the QC-based fusion products exhibited better skills than the Tripe Collocation (TC)-based products without considering EC. There were statistically significant differences in Pearson correlation coefficients and ubRMSE metric between the QC and TC-based products. Ignoring the EC between SMAPV7 and SMOS-ICV2 caused overestimations in their relative contributions to fusion data and degraded fusion accuracy. Specifically, the QC-based merging weight was reduced averagely by 0.27 (0.28) for SMAP (IC) when their error cross-correlation increased roughly from-0.42 to 0.9. This study can provide guidance for the generation of improved merged datasets at a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-nature-of-spatial-variability-of-four-soil-chemical-properties-and-the-implications-for-soil-sampling&quot;&gt;The nature of spatial variability of four soil chemical properties and the implications for soil sampling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose A poor understanding of the nature of variation of soil properties within a field can lead to management decisions that reduce productivity or increase off-site environmental risks. Methods The variability in total C%, total N%, plant-available (Colwell) P, and pH in CaCl2 at multiple depths is examined from two sites near Wagga Wagga and Yerong Creek in the mixed farming zone of southern New South Wales, Australia. The minimum number of cores required to estimate the mean for each soil property with a given level of precision (1%, 5%, and 10%) was determined and the distribution of the sample data was described by calculating the skewness and kurtosis. Results The number of cores (42 mm diameter) required to estimate the mean was least for soil pH (3 cores) at both sites and greatest for Colwell P (25 and 58 cores) at a 10% precision in the surface 0.1 m of soil at the Wagga Wagga and Yerong Creek sites, respectively. The distributions of soil chemical properties were greatly varied with skewness and kurtosis both influencing the data. The mean value of the pH distributions sometimes exceeded the mode, leading to an underestimation of the extent of soil acidity. The mean value for Colwell P also often exceeded the mode, indicating an overestimate of the P status of the soil from a productivity perspective but concurrently underestimating the risk of off-site losses, associated with high P values at some locations. There was also an overestimation of the organic C fractions at these sites. Noteworthy in our data was a broad distribution across a large range in all soil parameters at the soil surface which, despite a generally normal distribution at that depth, gave a mean value that represents a relatively constrained approximation of the true fertility status of the soil. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the variability in soil properties for interpreting soil test results appropriately for agronomic and environmental purposes. Due to its highly variable nature, Colwell P could not be reliably measured within the level of precision assumed under existing soil sampling guidelines used in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-overview-of-natural-soil-amendments-in-agriculture&quot;&gt;An overview of natural soil amendments in agriculture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manuscript describes the natural soil amendments used in agriculture, which are divided into three groups: organic, organic-mineral, and mineral amendments. It also describes less popular agents, such as clay minerals, sewage sludge, and amendments based on slaughterhouse wastes. A specific group of organic amendments are algae-base amendments which are becoming more and more popular. The soils most improved with natural amendments include sandy loam and clay soils. Natural organic amendments are best used on light soils that are poor in organic matter and nutrients (NPK). Whereas mineral amendments can be used as fertilizers (provide mainly Si, Ca and Al) or to restore degraded soils. Based on the analyzed literature, natural soil amendments may well be considered as an alternative to synthetic agricultural agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-bayesian-compressed-sensing-and-sparse-dictionaries-to-interpolate-soil-properties&quot;&gt;Using Bayesian compressed sensing and sparse dictionaries to interpolate soil properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capturing the spatial variations of soil properties through interpolation is an important aspect of soil mapping, usually conducted via geostatistics. Compressed sensing (CS) is an advanced signal processing theory that has been introduced in recent years for interpolating spatial data. Existing CS interpolation methods based on pre -constructed bases require regularization parameters and can produce only smooth interpolation results. To avoid the influence of artificially regularization parameters and to obtain more realistic maps of soil properties, an interpolation method based on Bayesian compressed sensing and sparse dictionaries (BCS-D) is proposed. The results of applications to two examples confirm its feasibility for mapping soil properties and show that BCS-D can provide kriging-like maps with global and local variability, reducing the risk of over-or under-estimation of soil properties over large areas. The greater prediction accuracy of BCS-D over geostatistical simulation is another advantage. A strategy for employing small and multisource training datasets is also developed for dic-tionary learning. Generally, BCS-D can be adopted as an interpolation method to meet the demand for realistic and accurate soil maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;role-of-fertilization-regime-on-soil-carbon-sequestration-and-crop-yield-in-a-maize-cowpea-intercropping-system-on-low-fertility-soils&quot;&gt;Role of fertilization regime on soil carbon sequestration and crop yield in a maize-cowpea intercropping system on low fertility soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving food security through intensive agricultural practices on low fertility soils is challenging as crop productivity is increasingly curtailed by the loss of soil structural stability and rapid depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC). As such, the conversion from traditional mono-cropping to legume-cereal intercropping, especially with integrated fertilization, may increase crop yields with the least ecological footprint. We set up a 2-year field experiment in a split-plot design with cowpea-maize monoculture and intercropping under different organic-inorganic fertilization regimes, including no fertilization (control), organic input only (compost), chemical input only (NPK), and multi-nutrient enriched compost (NPKEC). We observed that intercropped maize had a significantly higher biomass yield compared to the corresponding monoculture when fertilized with NPKEC fertilizer. However, cowpea biomass yield differences between monoculture and intercropped plots were comparable under all fertilization regimes. In contrast, the grain yield advantage of both maize and cowpea was significantly enhanced under the intercropping system compared to monoculture, with NPKEC showing the most significant effect among all fertilization regimes. When comparing the relative contribution of the fertilization regime to SOC, the NPKEC fertilizer provided the highest SOC-sequestration (0.30 Mg C/ha yr(-1)). At the same time, the effect of the cropping system on C-sequestration showed that intercropping provided the highest C-sequestration (0.17 Mg C/ha yr(-1)) compared to monocultures of both crops. Although compost application significantly increased mineral associated (MAOC) and particulate associated organic carbon (PAOC) concentrations compared to unfertilized control plots, NPKEC fertilization with intercropping system was the most effective combination causing the greatest increase of both soil C pools over time. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), the positive association of MAOC and PAOC with C-sequestration suggests the importance of both organic fractions as primary C reservoirs conducting SOC storage. Importantly, although compost alone in association with intercropping had a lower C-sequestration, it was associated to a better soil structure as confirmed by its positive relationship with macro-and micro-aggregation, water stable aggregates (WSA), and mean weight diameter (MDA). Overall, our results indicate the importance of restoring soil structure in degraded soils through appropriate land management solutions, such as stoichiometrically balanced fertilization practices (NPKEC) and crop diversification (intercropping), in order to achieve significant gains in SOC storage and, ultimately, improve crop productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;constraintid-an-online-software-tool-to-assist-grain-growers-in-australia-identify-areas-affected-by-soil-constraints&quot;&gt;ConstraintID: An online software tool to assist grain growers in Australia identify areas affected by soil constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil constraints, such as soil sodicity, salinity and acidity, are one cause of yield loss for grain growers globally. A first step towards reducing the associated yield gap is the identification of the area affected and the soil constraint/s responsible for the yield loss. Within a single field, persistent spatial variation of crop growth that repeats year after year is likely due to some form of soil constraint. Vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery can provide a valuable alternative to yield maps for assessing these persistent patterns. The variation identified from remote-sensing data can be compared with soil data from the field to help identify which soil constraints are potentially causing yield differences. This application note describes ConstraintID (www. constraintid.com.au), a web-based software tool that makes it easy for growers to use and interact with remote-sensing data to (1) reveal the persistent long-term variation of crop growth within their fields, (2) devise targeted soil sampling plans and (3) interpret the resulting soil data in view of critical values for certain soil constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-well-do-recently-reconstructed-solar-induced-fluorescence-datasets-model-gross-primary-productivity&quot;&gt;How well do recently reconstructed solar-induced fluorescence datasets model gross primary productivity?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection of various long-term reconstructed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) datasets derived at a range of spatio-temporal scales provides new opportunities for modelling vegetation dynamics, in particular, gross pri-mary productivity (GPP). Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007-2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees), namely - CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) -at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope -GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices - NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relation-ships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual vari-abilities across a wide range of climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dutch-soil-physical-units-map-bofek&quot;&gt;The Dutch soil physical units map: BOFEK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils and their properties play an important role in land evaluation studies. Often such studies focus on larger scales ranging from watersheds up to the national scale or even larger. Soil properties are often known at smaller scales, sometimes at the level of individual soil samples. The aim of this study is to show how point information on soil hydraulic properties, i.e., water retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics, can be upscaled via soil textural classes to a soil physical units map of a region or nation. Base information is the Dutch soil map (1:50,000) and the hydraulic properties of individual soil samples. All individual soil samples for which hy-draulic properties were measured were divided based on their texture into eighteen top-soils and eighteen sub-soils. For each of these thirty-six groups geometric average water retention and hydraulic conductivity charac-teristics were derived. In total 368 derived soil profiles are distinguished in the Dutch soil map consisting of soil layers that are linked to the thirty-six texture groups. For each soil profile eight static hydraulic properties were calculated. The soil profiles were then clustered based on these properties into seventy-nine clusters or units, which then make up a soil physical units map for the Netherlands. It has been demonstrated that dynamically simulated transpiration reduction for the clustered situation is similar to obtained for all individual soil profiles. At the Dutch national scale, the difference in simulated transpiration reduction between runs using all 368 soil profiles or the 79 soil physical units was less than 2.5 % percentage-points in 96 % of all plots or less than 5 % percentage-points in 99 % of all plots. Similar good correspondence was obtained for other water balance terms as well, including actual transpiration, actual evaporation at the soil surface, degree of saturation at 15 and 30 cm depth, the integrated water flux at 100 cm depth and surface runoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-sensing-of-land-change-a-multifaceted-perspective&quot;&gt;Remote sensing of land change: A multifaceted perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discipline of land change science has been evolving rapidly in the past decades. Remote sensing played a major role in one of the essential components of land change science, which includes observation, monitoring, and characterization of land change. In this paper, we proposed a new framework of the multifaceted view of land change through the lens of remote sensing and recommended five facets of land change including change location, time, target, metric, and agent. We also evaluated the impacts of spatial, spectral, temporal, angular, and data-integration domains of the remotely sensed data on observing, monitoring, and characterization of different facets of land change, as well as discussed some of the current land change products. We recommend clarifying the specific land change facet being studied in remote sensing of land change, reporting multiple or all facets of land change in remote sensing products, shifting the focus from land cover change to specific change metric and agent, integrating social science data and multi-sensor datasets for a deeper and fuller understanding of land change, and recognizing limitations and weaknesses of remote sensing in land change studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-geological-reports-based-on-knowledge-graphs-using-a-deep-learning-approach&quot;&gt;Understanding geological reports based on knowledge graphs using a deep learning approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geological reports aid in understanding exploration by providing valuable information on rock formation , evolution and the geological environment in which deposits formed. Querying and extracting the critical information from these enormous historical geological report data helps in understanding the exploration risks in different geological settings. However, large amounts of unstructured text data occur in geological reports; therefore, it is challenging to obtain valuable information from them without performing information extraction and processing. This study proposed an automated method for extracting information from geological reports through triple extraction, then automatically constructs a geological knowledge graph from the extracted entities and relations. Simultaneously, due to the lack of samples, this study used multiple geological reports to construct a corpus of jointly extracted geological entities and relations. The proposed model reached an F1-score of 90.05% in the experimental results on the constructed corpus. Finally, a knowledge graph was constructed based on the extracted results to demonstrate the application value of the proposed method. The results showed that the structured information helps better represent the content of the source report and matches well with the geological domain knowledge. The proposed method can quickly and robustly convert textual data into a structured form that is convenient for reasoning and querying geological entities and relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-probability-based-granular-field-of-vegetated-soils&quot;&gt;The probability-based granular field of vegetated soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils in vegetation-covered areas are of high variability in space and time, and the variability is crucial for hydro-geophysical processes at small and large scales. Conventionally, the spatial heterogeneity at large scale is visualized as a regional division map of soil properties by extrapolating sample measurements. No formalized method is available for assigning parameters for soils at the resolution of a small grid cell. This study formulates a method of establishing parameter space for vegetated soil by a single index (mu) derived from the unified grain size distribution (GSD). The index mu varies in space as a random variable and defines soil as a granular field. The mu-division represents the concentration of fine grains in response to root-soil interactions. Coupling mu-division with moisture distribution suggests that the gradient of mu plays a potential role in rooted soil hydraulics. It is further found that mu satisfies the Weibull distribution, which makes it possible to establish the mu-field for a soil space at large scale using the random dataset of mu. A case study is conducted in two vegetated slopes based on high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) derived from unmanned aerial vehicle survey to create the field and illustrate its implications in morphology and hydrology. It is expected that the mu-field may derive parameter fields of various soil properties as functions of the GSD parameters and thus equip DEM with a complete dataset of soil. The paradigm proposed in the study fills the gap of establishing high-resolution data space for soil at large scale for dynamics of surface processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although agricultural colluvial soils are important storage for soil organic carbon (SOC), the mechanisms underlying colluvial (cumulative soils) SOC stability have received little attention so far. In this study, we aim to understand to what extent the main controls on colluvial SOC stability differ from those observed in non-colluvial soils. Paired soil profiles (non-colluvial versus colluvial) were collected from five sites which differ in climate, soil geochemical background and cultivation history. Topsoil (0-10 cm) and subsoil (30-50 cm) were analysed for SOC fractions, mineral composition, potential soil respiration and radiocarbon content. Our analysis showed that for non-colluvial soils, climate, cultivation history and weathering degree have significant effects on potential soil respiration. In contrast, for colluvial soils, the most influential factor for potential soil respiration was the rate of accretion and this was independent of climatic and geochemical context. Furthermore, accretion rates indirectly affected potential soil respiration by interacting with the degree of weathering of deposited soil. This changed the mineral matrix of colluvial soil settings and thereby may enhance soil mineral-related SOC stabilisation mechanisms. Together, these results suggest that the dominant controls on SOC stability in colluvial soils differ from those in non-colluvial soils, and the soil accretion rate is the most important control on colluvial SOC stability in agricultural systems. Highlights The dominant controls on SOC stability in colluvial and non-colluvial soils were compared. Climate and mineral weathering predominantly control SOC stability in non-colluvial soils. In contrast, the accretion rate is the key factor controlling colluvial SOC stability. Accretion rate drives the role of mineral weathering in colluvial SOC stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dynamic-changes-of-soil-air-filled-porosity-associated-with-soil-shrinkage-in-a-vertisol&quot;&gt;The dynamic changes of soil air-filled porosity associated with soil shrinkage in a Vertisol&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil aeration is critical for crop growth, which is generally assessed by air-filled porosity (AFP). In non-rigid soils with high shrinkage and swelling, the AFP is not only related to the total porosity and soil moisture, but also to the soil shrinkage behaviour. However, the relationship between AFP and soil shrinkage has not been clarified. The objectives of this study were to (1) establish a mathematical equation to describe the behaviours of AFP associated with soil shrinkage (AFP(sh)); and (2) to evaluate the influence of tillage practice on the AFP(sh). Undisturbed soil core samples were collected from the 0-10 cm to 10-20 cm layers in a Vertisol under four tillage treatments (No tillage, NT; Rotary tillage, RT; Subsoiling, SS; Deep ploughing, DP) to measure the changes in the volumes of soil core, soil water and air at different soil matric potentials. Our results showed that an equation of AFP(sh) as a function of moisture ratio (&amp;amp; thetasym;) was well established based on the developed soil shrinkage model (R-2 &amp;gt; 0.990, RMSE &amp;lt;0.012). Compared with the AFP under a constant pore assumption (AFP(c)), the AFP(sh) was significantly decreased by 10.6% to 60.3% as soil water matric potentials were at &amp;lt;-33 kPa in the 0-10 cm layer or at &amp;lt;-10 kPa in the 10-20 cm layer (p &amp;lt; 0.05). According to the AFP(sh) curve of the Vertisol, soil moisture content (theta) was approximately 68%-80% of the field capacity when AFP(sh) reached non-limiting status (0.10 cm(3) cm(-3)), where the soil matric potential was close to the wilting point (-1500 kPa). Deep tillage treatment (SS and DP) increased AFP(sh), showing good performance in decreasing the risk of soil aeration deficit relative to the NT and RT treatment. Our results demonstrate that neglecting the porosity variations during shrinkage may lead to a high bias in the AFP prediction. Highlights An equation of AFP associated with soil shrinkage was established. AFP was significantly decreased when soil shrinkage was considered for a Vertisol. The Vertisol was easily subjected to both water and air stress due to soil shrinkage. Deep tillage practises improved soil aeration in the Vertisol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;differentiable-learnable-regionalized-process-based-models-with-multiphysical-outputs-can-approach-state-of-the-art-hydrologic-prediction-accuracy&quot;&gt;Differentiable, Learnable, Regionalized Process-Based Models With Multiphysical Outputs can Approach State-Of-The-Art Hydrologic Prediction Accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictions of hydrologic variables across the entire water cycle have significant value for water resources management as well as downstream applications such as ecosystem and water quality modeling. Recently, purely data-driven deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) showed seemingly insurmountable performance in modeling rainfall runoff and other geoscientific variables, yet they cannot predict untrained physical variables and remain challenging to interpret. Here, we show that differentiable, learnable, process-based models (called delta models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM for the intensively observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, enhance, or replace the process-based model’s modules. Without using an ensemble or post-processor, delta models can obtain a median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.732 for 671 basins across the USA for the Daymet forcing data set, compared to 0.748 from a state-of-the-art LSTM model with the same setup. For another forcing data set, the difference is even smaller: 0.715 versus 0.722. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can output a full set of untrained variables, for example, soil and groundwater storage, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and baseflow, and can later be constrained by their observations. Both simulated evapotranspiration and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with alternative estimates. The general framework can work with models with various process complexity and opens up the path for learning physics from big data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-sensing-of-groundwater-current-capabilities-and-future-directions&quot;&gt;Remote Sensing of Groundwater: Current Capabilities and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, groundwater represents a critical natural resource that is affected by changes in natural supply and renewal, as well as by increasing human demand and consumption. However, despite its critical role, groundwater is difficult to accurately quantify as it is beneath the Earth surface. Here, we review several state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques useful for local- to global-scale groundwater monitoring and assessment, including proxies for groundwater extraction. These include inferring changes in subsurface water from mass changes using gravitational measurements, and analyzing changes in the Earth surface height using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, Light Detection and Ranging, Airborne Electromagnetic Systems, and satellite altimetry. Remote sensing information is often used in tandem with ground-based observations such as hydraulic head in wells, Global Navigational Satellite System monitoring, and numerical modeling to complement the space-based approaches. In the future, fusing different remote sensing techniques capable of operating in various environments will yield additional insight on the state and rate of use for groundwater across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-organic-matter-storage-in-temperate-lowland-arable-grassland-and-woodland-topsoil-and-subsoil&quot;&gt;Soil organic matter storage in temperate lowland arable, grassland and woodland topsoil and subsoil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils are the largest terrestrial pool of organic carbon, with up to 50% of soil organic carbon (SOC) stored below 30 cm. Knowledge of the impact of land use on the mechanisms by which SOC is stored in subsoils is critical to developing and delivering strategies to mitigate climate change. We characterized SOC under arable, grassland, and deciduous woodland land uses in lowland England to determine how land use affects the mechanisms by which topsoil and subsoil SOC are protected. Soil organic matter (SOM) physical fractionation and ammonium oxalate extractable Al, Fe and Mn were analysed to elucidate protection mechanisms. Results revealed that the mineral-free particulate organic matter (fPOM) fraction was significantly greater in both the topsoil and subsoil under woodland than under grassland or arable. The mineral-associated organic carbon (MinOC) fraction was proportionally greater in the subsoil compared with topsoil under all land uses, with arable &amp;gt;grassland &amp;gt; woodland. These findings indicate that land use affects the extent to which SOC is protected, with woodlands containing a higher proportion of carbon that has less protection from decomposition. Subsoil SOC is protected from decomposition by organo-mineral interactions with amorphous Al, Fe and Mn, and may be susceptible to future pH shifts as a result of land use change. This study highlights the need to consider the impact of land use change on SOC, given policy and public interest in woodland planting for climate change mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-assessment-of-soil-structural-quality-across-soil-textures-and-compaction-levels---part-i-examination-of-intact-soil-cores&quot;&gt;Visual assessment of soil structural quality across soil textures and compaction levels - Part I: Examination of intact soil cores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil structural degradation has become very common and leads to a serious decline in soil health. Improving or maintaining soil structure is key to build resilience against drought and flooding, and thus contributes to assuring food and water security. Quantification of soil structural quality is usually accomplished by traditional laboratory-based methods, which are time-, labour-and money-consuming. Visual soil evaluation and exami-nation methods comprise rapid and simple tests that offer a numeric semi-quantitative assessment of soil structure. The common criteria are aggregate size and shape, ease of break or rupture resistance, and inter-or intra-aggregate porosity. In this study, the CoreVESS method, a variant of the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method originally developed for topsoil assessment, was applied on 250 cm(3) undisturbed soil core samples. Resulting soil quality scores (Sq, ranging between 1, good, and 5, poor) were compared with soil quality indicators (SQi) derived from traditional quantitative methods of soil structure analysis. Tested SQi’s included penetration resistance, bulk density, soil hydraulic properties, soil organic carbon and texture (percentage of clay, silt and sand). The objective of the study was to assess and quantify the state of soil structural degradation induced by agricultural operations using a suite of methods of analysis at a regional scale, with a special focus on CoreVESS. Soil core samples were taken in Belgium from 42 cropped fields, at two positions (headland and in-field zone) and from three layers, notably the ploughed topsoil (TOP, 10-20 cm), the compacted subsoil (CSUB, 30-40 cm) and the deeper subsoil (SUB, 60-70 cm), totalling the sample horizons to 252. Test and sampling sites comprised all major soil texture classes within the Belgian soil textural triangle and varied from sand to heavy clay. In-field positions (IN-FIELD) showed significantly better coreVESS-based Sq scores as compared to headland positions (HEAD), with the CSUB layers always exhibiting significantly lower quality than the other two layers. Laboratory-derived soil quality indicator (SQi) values portrayed the same trend, with CSUB layers always indicating the poorest soil quality. Significant differences in SQi’s were also found between soils of acceptable (Sq &amp;amp; LE; 3) and degraded (Sq &amp;gt; 3) structure. Likewise, grouping soils into the same categories resulted in significant differences in the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves in their wet ranges. There were good significant relationships between the SQi values and CoreVESS-based Sq scores, with for example Pearson R correlation coefficients of 0.64 for both penetration resistance and bulk density. Also, Sq scores related well with an SQi-based soil quality index (SQI) value averaged per layer and texture class (Pearson R of 0.60). The study confirmed that agricultural operations and their intensity clearly affect soil structural quality across various soil textures, with CoreVESS being as responsive to variation in soil structure quality as traditional quantitative methods, even when applied in the subsoil. VESS methods thus have a potential for monitoring soil structural quality over a variety of textures in a rapid, intuitive, practical and cheap way, as an alternative for or being complementary to more expensive labour-intensive traditional quantitative methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information regarding the spatial distribution of soil water content is key in many disciplines and applications including soil and atmospheric sciences, hydrology, and agricultural engineering. Thus, within the past decades various experimental methods and strategies have been developed to map spatial variations in soil moisture distribution and to monitor temporal changes. Our study examines the combination of electrical resistivity mapping and point observations of soil moisture to infer the spatial and the temporal variability of soil moisture. Over a period of around two years, we performed field measurements on six days to collect repeated electrical resistivity mapping data for a nine-hectare test site south-east of Berlin, Germany. Permanently installed TDR probes, temporary TDR measurements within permanently installed tubes, and gravimetric measurements using soil samples provided soil moisture data at various selected points. In addition, soil analysis and classification results are available for 132 regularly distributed positions up to depths of 1.2 m. We compare and link three-dimensional resistivity models obtained via data inversion to soil composition and soil moisture as provided by our point data. Both the soil samples and the resistivity models indicate a two-layer medium characterized by a sandy top layer with varying thickness and a loamy bottom soil. For all six field campaigns, we observe similar resistivity patterns reflecting the temporally stable influence of soil texture. While the overall patterns are stable, the range of resistivity values changes with soil moisture. Finally, to estimate spatial models of soil moisture, we link our soil moisture and resistivity data using empirical petrophysical models relying on a second order polynomial function. We observe a mean prediction error for soil moisture of +/-0.034 m3 &amp;amp; BULL; m? 3 using all observation points while we notice that point-specific models further reduce the error. Thus, we conclude that our experimental and data analysis strategies represent a reliable approach to establish site-specific models and to estimate three-dimensional moisture distribution including temporal variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluation-of-aggregate-stability-methods-for-soil-health&quot;&gt;Evaluation of aggregate stability methods for soil health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregate stability is a commonly used indicator of soil health because improvements in aggregate stability are related to reduced erodibility and improved soil-water dynamics. During the past 80 to 90 years, numerous methods have been developed to assess aggregate stability. Limited comparisons among the methods have resulted in varied magnitudes of response to soil health management practices and varied influences of inherent soil properties and climate. It is not clear whether selection of a specific method creates any advantage to the investigator. This study assessed four commonly used methods of measuring aggregate stability using data collected as part of the North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements. The methods included water stable aggregates using the Cornell Rainfall Simulator (WSACASH), wet sieved water stable aggregates (WSAARS), slaking captured and adapted from SLAKES smart-phone image recognition software (STAB10), and the mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates (MWD). Influence of climate and inherent soil prop-erties at the continental scale were analyzed in addition to method responses to rotation diversity, cash crop count, residue management, organic nutrient amendments, cover crops, and tillage. The four methods were moderately correlated with each other. All methods were sensitive to differences in climate and inherent soil properties between sites, although to different degrees. None measured significant effects from rotation diversity or crop count, but all methods detected significant increases in aggregate stability resulting from reduced tillage. Significant increases or positive trends were observed for all methods in relation to cover cropping, increased residue retention, and organic amendments, except for STAB10, which expressed a slightly negative response to organic amendments. Considering these results, no single method was clearly superior and all four are viable options for measuring aggregate stability. Therefore, secondary considerations (e.g., cost, method availability, increased sensitivity to a specific management practice, or minimal within-treatment variability) driven by the needs of the investigator, should determine the most suitable method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) methods receive increasing attention and are gaining popularity. Since in modern agriculture, soil structure degradation becomes very common, it is essential to protect and improve soil structure quality. Methods that enable its straightforward monitoring are therefore needed. Numerous visual soil evaluation techniques that serve this purpose exist, and are varying in objective, evaluation depth (topsoil/ subsoil), evaluation method, number of criteria assessed and their final scoring. In this study, we mainly focus on three VESS methods, two of which were employed in the field along a profile wall (Visual Evaluation of Subsoil Structure, SubVESS, and Double Spade VESS method, DSVESS), and one in the laboratory on soil cores (Cor-eVESS). The main aim of this research was to test and compare these VESS-based methods in terms of their feasibility and repeatability in detecting soil structure degradation in the topsoil and subsoil. Sixteen cropped fields were chosen in Belgium covering six of seven major soil texture classes according to the Belgian soil textural triangle (i.e., sand, loamy sand, light sandy loam, silt loam, clay, and heavy clay). SubVESS and DSVESS were performed in the same pits until 80 cm and 40 cm, respectively. Soil cores for CoreVESS and for the determination of soil quality indicators (SQi) with conventional laboratory methods were taken from three layers, that is, the ploughed topsoil (-10–20 cm, “TOP”), the compacted subsoil (-30–40 cm, “CSUB”), and the deeper subsoil (-60–70 cm, “SUB”), totalling 96 horizons. While SubVESS and CoreVESS were originally developed to evaluate subsoil and topsoil, respectively, they were thus used here beyond those zones. Moreover, all sampling and field evaluation was done at two positions per field -the more compacted headland and the less compacted in-field zone. It was shown that the soil quality (Sq) scores assigned to the cores with CoreVESS were not significantly influenced by operators with different backgrounds but all having received basic VESS training. When comparing field and laboratory results, positive relationships were found between Sq scores of SubVESS, DSVESS and CoreVESS. All VESS methods were able to assign significantly better soil quality (lower scores) at in-field positions (IN-FIELD) as compared to headland positions (HEAD), and significantly lower quality (higher scores) to CSUB layers than to the other two layers. Laboratory-derived SQi values presented a similar trend, with CSUB layers always indicating worse situations. There were good significant relationships between the SQi values and the different VESS-based Sq scores as well, with DSVESS showing the best correlations among the three VESS methods. The study thus confirmed that the different VESS methods all have a potential for moni-toring soil structure quality in a fast, cheap, intuitive and practical way, although they all have their own ad-vantages and disadvantages. Additionally, those methods that were employed at depths other than those for which they were developed did perform well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monitoring-changes-in-global-soil-organic-carbon-stocks-from-space&quot;&gt;Monitoring changes in global soil organic carbon stocks from space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils are under threat globally, with declining soil productivity and soil health in many places. As a key indicator of soil functioning, soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for ensuring food, soil, water and energy security, together with biodiversity protection. While there is a global effort to map SOC stock and status, SOC is a dynamic soil property and can change rapidly as a function of land management and land use. Here, we introduce a semi-mechanistic model to monitor SOC stocks at a global scale, underpinned by one of the largest worldwide soil database to date. Our model generates a SOC stock baseline for the year 2001, which is then propagated through time by keeping track of annual landcover changes obtained from remote sensing products with loss and gain dynamics dependent on temperature and precipitation, which finally define the magnitude, rate and direction of the SOC changes. We estimated a global SOC stock in the top 30 cm of around 793 Pg with annual losses due to landcover change of 1.9 Pg SOC yr-1 from 2001 to 2020, 20% larger than the annual production-based emissions of the United States in 2018. The biggest losses were found in the tropic and sub-tropical regions, accounting for almost 50% of the total global loss. This is a considerable contribution to greenhouse gas emissions but it also has a direct impact on agricultural production with more than 16 million hectares yr-1 falling below critical SOC limits. The proposed modelling framework is flexible, allowing it to be updated as more remote sensing and soil data becomes available, offering a first-of-its-kind global spatio-temporal SOC stock assessment and monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;knowledge-representation-in-digital-agriculture-a-step-towards-standardised-model&quot;&gt;Knowledge representation in digital agriculture: A step towards standardised model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, data science has evolved significantly. Data analysis and mining processes become routines in all sectors of the economy where datasets are available. Vast data repositories have been collected, curated, stored, and used for extracting knowledge. And this is becoming commonplace. Subsequently, we extract a large amount of knowledge, either directly from the data or through experts in the given domain. The challenge now is how to exploit all this large amount of knowledge that is previously known for efficient decision-making processes. Until recently, much of the knowledge gained through a number of years of research is stored in static knowledge bases or ontologies, while more diverse and dynamic knowledge acquired from data mining studies is not centrally and consistently managed. In this research, we propose a novel model called ontology-based knowledge map to represent and store the results (knowledge) of data mining in crop farming to build, maintain, and enrich the process of knowledge discovery. The proposed model consists of six main sets: concepts, attributes, relations, transformations, instances, and states. This model is dynamic and facilitates the access, updates, and exploitation of the knowledge at any time. This paper also proposes an architecture for handling this knowledge-based model. The system architecture includes knowledge modelling, extraction, assessment, publishing, and exploitation. This system has been implemented and used in agriculture for crop management and monitoring. It is proven to be very effective and promising for its extension to other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;explainable-ai-for-earth-observation-a-review-including-societal-and-regulatory-perspectives&quot;&gt;Explainable AI for earth observation: A review including societal and regulatory perspectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence and machine learning are ubiquitous in the domain of Earth Observation (EO) and Remote Sensing. Congruent to their success in the domain of computer vision, they have proven to obtain high accuracies for EO applications. Yet experts of EO should also consider the weaknesses of complex, machine-learning models before adopting them for specific applications. One such weakness is the lack of explainability of complex deep learning models. This paper reviews published examples of explainable ML or explainable AI in the field of Earth Observation. Explainability methods are classified as: intrinsic versus post-hoc, model-specific versus model -agnostic, and global versus local explanations and examples of each type are provided. This paper also iden-tifies key explainability requirements identified the social sciences and upcoming regulatory recommendations from UNESCO Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and requirements from the EU draft Artificial Intelligence Act and analyzes whether these limitations are sufficiently addressed in the field of EO.The findings indicate that there is a lack of clarity regarding which models can be considered interpretable or not. EO applications often utilize Random Forests as an “interpretable” benchmark algorithm to compare to complex deep-learning models even though social sciences clearly argue that large Random Forests cannot be considered as such. Secondly, most explanations target domain experts and not possible users of the algorithm, regulatory bodies, or those who might be affected by an algorithm’s decisions. Finally, publications tend to simply provide explanations without testing the usefulness of the explanation by the intended audience. In light of these societal and regulatory considerations, a framework is provided to guide the selection of an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the availability of simpler algorithms with a high predictive accuracy as well as the purpose and intended audience of the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Green Deal puts a healthy environment at the core of policy-making initiatives in the European Union (EU). Soil, due to its nature, is a central actor to be considered when developing and implementing actions in many areas, from biodiversity and agriculture to climate and pollution. New means for monitoring the impact of decisions taken in these sectors are needed. The Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS modules of Soil Biodiversity and Pesticides provide both policy-makers and the research community with tools in this direction. The first component corresponds to the largest analysis of soil biodiversity across the EU through molecular biology techniques. The second component is the most extensive harmonised pan-European assessment of pesticide residues in agricultural soils. Specific features, together with policy and research potential of these instruments for achieving Green Deals targets under the Biodiversity 2030 Strategy, the Farm to Fork Strategy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan, are presented. All generated data are made available to the public through the EU Soil Observatory and European Soil Data Centre. Highlights LUCAS Soil Biodiversity is a monitoring survey of biodiversity in the European Union. LUCAS Soil Pesticides is a monitoring survey of pesticide residues in the European Union. Protocols and data from LUCAS Soil Biodiversity and Pesticides are open access. LUCAS Soil Biodiversity and Pesticides can support policy and research development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anthropogenic-dark-earth-evolution-distribution-physical-and-chemical-properties&quot;&gt;Anthropogenic dark earth: Evolution, distribution, physical, and chemical properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropogenic dark earth (ADE) is a category of Anthrosols (anthropogenic soils) characterised by dark colour from homogeneous charcoal inclusion and extraordinary fertility compared with non-anthropogenic soils. The study aims to provide a detailed overview of the origin and distributions of ADEs, together with their physical and chemical characteristics, to reveal their fertility status for arable land use. According to this study, most studied ADEs are well distributed in tropical (Amazonian and African dark earth) and temperate (European dark earth) climatic regions. Middens are localised, with large-sized ones well preserved in the Arctic region due to the wet and cold weather conditions. The formation of ADE is mainly associated with deliberate and unintentional ancient human activities: deposition of domestic and occupational wastes, charred residues, biomass ashes, burning, and fertilisation of fields. The characteristic dark colour of ADE resulted mainly from charcoal and the decomposition of organic wastes. The material composition of ADEs (including charcoal, organic matter, and clay) contributes to the formation of sizable pores for the retention of water and elements and aeration. ADE exhibits a C:N ratio for good mineralization, stable organic matter stock, and higher cation exchange capacity. Additionally, ADEs are characterised by circum-neutral reactions and enriched by nutrients (C, N, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Fe) and other elements (Sr, Rb, and Ba) compared with surrounding non-anthropogenic soils. Although generally highly productive, a comparison of herbage production and crop yields between ADEs and natural soils is not well studied. The persistence of anthropogenic activities that lead to the formation of ADE indicates that these soils are still subject to continuous development, especially in rural settings. Adopting the process of ADE development in recent arable land can represent a promising future for sustainable agriculture. Highlights Anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs) are characterized by their physical and chemical signatures. Characteristic high pore size of ADEs due to charcoal inclusion support the retention of nutrients. ADEs are often have reduced acidity and high C, N, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Fe contents. ADEs represent an archive of fertile soils suitable for sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halving-nitrogen-waste-in-the-european-union-food-systems-requires-both-dietary-shifts-and-farm-level-actions&quot;&gt;Halving nitrogen waste in the European Union food systems requires both dietary shifts and farm level actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pivotal role of nitrogen to achieve environmental sustainable development goals and transform our food system is recognized in an ambitious nitrogen waste reduction target in the Farm to Fork Strategy of the European Commission. But is this a realistic objective and if so, what are the pathways that lead to success? To answer these questions, we first established, as a baseline, an updated food system nitrogen budget for the EU for the year 2015. The EU used 20 Tg of virgin (new) N to deliver 2.5 Tg N in food and 1.2 Tg N in fibres to consumers, yielding a food-system nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of 18%. We then built a simple model to combine intervention options that (a) increase farm level nitrogen use efficiencies, (b) reduce food waste increase recycling of waste and improve waste treatment, or (c) achieve a dietary shift towards healthier dietary patterns. The largest potential to increase N efficiency of the current agro-food system was found to lie in the livestock sector. From 144 possible combinations of intervention options analysed, we found that 12 combinations of interventions would reduce nitrogen losses by about 50%, 11 involving diet change. We further carried out an assessment of the societal appreciation of combinations of interventions considering private and public costs of the intervention measures, public benefit through effects on health and increased biodiversity of ecosystems, and public costs for overcoming socio-cultural barriers. Results show that a combination of moderate intervention options achieve halving of N losses at lowest societal costs. We conclude that systemic approaches are paramount to achieve deep nitrogen reduction targets and diet change appears to be an essential condition for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;characterizing-groundwater-chemistry-and-recharge-in-the-critical-zone-of-an-agricultural-claypan-watershed&quot;&gt;Characterizing Groundwater Chemistry and Recharge in the Critical Zone of an Agricultural Claypan Watershed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils with low permeability horizons (e.g., claypans) are vulnerable to loss of nutrients through surface runoff along with preferential flow paths through the restrictive horizon to deeper aquifers. Partitioning between these hydrologic pathways is important to determine transport processes and develop strategies that mitigate stream contamination. Our objective was to investigate controls on groundwater chemistry and recharge pathways using natural geochemical tracers in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed in Missouri, U.S. Groundwater samples were collected during 2011-2017 from 32 piezometers ranging from 0.13 to 16 m deep along with stream water and precipitation. Diagnostic tools of mixing models indicated that chemistry of perched water directly above the claypan and shallow groundwater immediately below was controlled primarily by chemical equilibrium. Five solutes behaved conservatively in most deep piezometers (&amp;gt;5 m), reflecting mixing of two end members and the lack of significant denitrification processes. End member mixing analysis showed that the deeper groundwater originated primarily from groundwater at similar depths, often upslope or from strata directly above, with small contributions from perched water, highlighting the importance of both horizontal and vertical preferential recharge pathways. Vertical pathways are likely dictated by soil heterogeneity throughout the critical zone and do not occur synchronously with precipitation events or simultaneously over all piezometer locations. The complex recharge pathways provide stochastic conduits for nitrate transport to deeper aquifers where legacy stores accumulate, presenting a significant challenge for water quality management in watersheds with restrictive soil horizons and spatially and temporally heterogeneous preferential flow pathways, including the Mississippi River Basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-acidification-induced-by-intensive-agricultural-use-depending-on-climate&quot;&gt;Soil acidification induced by intensive agricultural use depending on climate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose Soil acidification is a major issue in agricultural ecosystems. However, how agricultural land uses shape the soil pH pattern and affect soil acidification on a regional scale are still poorly understood. The research aims to investigate the influences of typical agricultural practices on soil acidification across different climate zones of eastern China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materials and methods Soil samples were collected from 240 sites and 3 land uses per site (uplands, paddies, and adjacent woodlands) across four climate zones (mid-temperate, warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions) of eastern China. Soil pH was quantified for each soil samples. The mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) at each site were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results and discussion Climate was significantly associated with soil acidification. The differences in soil pH between adjacent land use types ranged from 0.02 to 1.12, whereas those between climate zones ranged from 0.34 to 2.22. Alkaline soils (cooler climates) exhibited a stronger acidification pace than acidic soils (warmer climates). Uplands resulted in alarming decrease in soil pH by 1.12 units relative to adjacent woodlands in mid-temperate zone, which may be induced by the dramatic loss of soil carbon. Acidification of uplands was stronger than that of paddies, owing to higher soil nitrification and carbon mineralization. Croplands had higher soil pH than adjacent woodlands only in the subtropics, indicating that agricultural practices in this zone were effective to retard soil acidification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion We demonstrated, for the first time, the direction and intensity of the differences in soil pH levels among adjacent agricultural lands and woodlands depending on climate. As the two common agricultural croplands across eastern China, uplands have stronger acidification relative to paddies, particularly in the mid-temperate zone. Proper agricultural management practices to avoid carbon losses and preserve the flooding status of paddies should be considered to resist acidification of cropland soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-health-and-microplastics-a-review-of-the-impacts-of-microplastic-contamination-on-soil-properties&quot;&gt;Soil health and microplastics: a review of the impacts of microplastic contamination on soil properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose Soil is a thin coating of matter that covers the earth’s surface, formed through the process of rock weathering. It is a natural filter for impurities in groundwater and is very important to human health. Recently, some studies from around the world have confirmed that the presence of microplastics in soil is increasing. However, most of these studies only examined the impacts of soil microplastic contamination one or two soil health indicators, rather than study all three soil health indicators at once. Methods In this review, we selected papers published internationally in the past decade and examined the trend of the effects of soil microplastic contamination on all three soil health indicators. Results and discussion Soil microplastic contamination resulted in either an increase or decrease in the trend of the effects on physicochemical and biological soil properties. In other cases, microplastic contaminants do not affect soil properties. The alteration of soil health properties by microplastics was associated with a couple of reasons such as microplastic concentrations and types, changes in soil mechanics and microorganisms. Conclusions The current impact and severity of soil microplastic contamination on soil health properties are expected to persist for a long time, especially with increasing global plastic production. Therefore, more research is required to continuously assess the impact of microplastic contamination on other indicators of soil health that has not been studied previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deep-c-storage-biological-chemical-and-physical-strategies-to-enhance-carbon-stocks-in-agricultural-subsoils&quot;&gt;Deep-C storage: Biological, chemical and physical strategies to enhance carbon stocks in agricultural subsoils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to their substantial volume, subsoils contain more of the total soil carbon (C) pool than topsoils. Much of this C is thousands of years old, suggesting that subsoils offer considerable potential for long-term C sequestration. However, knowledge of subsoil C behaviour and manageability remains incomplete, and subsoil C storage potential has yet to be realised at a large scale, particularly in agricultural systems. A range of biological (e.g. deep-rooting), chemical (e.g. biochar burial) and physical (e.g. deep ploughing) C sequestration strategies have been proposed, but are yet to be assessed. In this review, we identify the main factors that regulate subsoil C cycling and critically evaluate the evidence and mechanistic basis of subsoil strategies designed to promote greater C storage, with particular emphasis on agroecosystems. We assess the barriers and opportunities for the implementation of strategies to enhance subsoil C sequestration and identify 5 key current gaps in scientific understanding. We conclude that subsoils, while highly heterogeneous, are in many cases more suited to long-term C sequestration than topsoils. The proposed strategies may also bring other tangible benefits to cropping systems (e.g. enhanced water holding capacity and nutrient use efficiency). Furthermore, while the subsoil C sequestration strategies we reviewed have large potential, more long-term studies are needed across a diverse range of soils and climates, in conjunction with chronosequence and space-for-time substitutions. Also, it is vital that subsoils are more consistently included in modelled estimations of soil C stocks and C sequestration potential, and that subsoil-explicit C models are developed to specifically reflect subsoil processes. Finally, further mapping of subsoil C is needed in specific regions (e.g. in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, South and Central America, South Asia and Africa). Conducting both immediate and long-term subsoil C studies will fill the knowledge gaps to devise appropriate soil C sequestration strategies and policies to help in the global fight against climate change and decline in soil quality. In conclusion, our evidence-based analysis reveals that subsoils offer an untapped potential to enhance global C storage in terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-uncertainty-induced-by-pedotransfer-functions-in-terrestrial-biosphere-modeling&quot;&gt;On the Uncertainty Induced by Pedotransfer Functions in Terrestrial Biosphere Modeling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydrological, ecohydrological, and terrestrial biosphere models depend on pedotransfer functions for computing soil hydraulic parameters based on easily measurable variables, such as soil textural and physical properties. Several pedotransfer functions have been derived in the last few decades, providing divergent estimates of soil hydraulic parameters. In this study, we quantify how uncertainties embedded in using different pedotransfer functions propagate to ecosystem dynamics, including simulated hydrological fluxes and vegetation response to water availability. Using a state-of-the-art ecohydrological model applied at 79 sites worldwide, we show that uncertainties related to pedotransfer functions can affect both hydrological and vegetation dynamics. Uncertainties in evapotranspiration, plant productivity, and vegetation structure, quantified as leaf area, are in the order of similar to 10% at annual time scales. Runoff and groundwater recharge uncertainties are one order of magnitude larger. All uncertainties are largely amplified when small-scale topography is taken into account in a distributed domain, especially for water-limited ecosystems with low permeability soils. Overall, pedotransfer function related uncertainties for a given soil type are higher than uncertainties across soil types in both hydrological and ecosystem dynamics. The magnitude of uncertainties is climate-dependent but not soil type-dependent. Evapotranspiration, vegetation structure, and plant productivity uncertainties are higher in water-limited semiarid climates, whereas groundwater recharge uncertainties are higher in climates where potential evapotranspiration is comparable to precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cover-crop-functional-types-differentially-alter-the-content-and-composition-of-soil-organic-carbon-in-particulate-and-mineral-associated-fractions&quot;&gt;Cover crop functional types differentially alter the content and composition of soil organic carbon in particulate and mineral-associated fractions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover crops (CCs) can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration by providing additional OC residues, recruiting beneficial soil microbiota, and improving soil aggregation and structure. The various CC species that belong to distinct plant functional types (PFTs) may differentially impact SOC formation and stabilization. Biogeochemical theory suggests that selection of PFTs with distinct litter quality (C:N ratio) should influence the pathways and magnitude of SOC sequestration. Yet, we lack knowledge on the effect of CCs from different PFTs on the quantity and composition of physiochemical pools of SOC. We sampled soils under monocultures of three CC PFTs (legume [crimson clover]; grass [triticale]; and brassica [canola]) and a mixture of these three species, from a long-term CC experiment in Pennsylvania, USA. We measured C content in bulk soil and C content and composition in contrasting physical fractions: particulate organic matter, POM; and mineral-associated organic matter, MAOM. The bulk SOC content was higher in all CC treatments compared to the fallow. Compared to the legume, monocultures of grass and brassica with lower litter quality (wider C:N) had higher proportion of plant-derived C in POM, indicating selective preservation of complex structural plant compounds. In contrast, soils under legumes had greater accumulation of microbial-derived C in MAOM. Our results for the first time, revealed that the mixture contributed to a higher concentration of plant-derived compounds in POM relative to the legume, and a greater accumulation of microbial-derived C in MAOM compared to monocultures of grass and brassica. Mixtures with all three PFTs can thus increase the short- and long-term SOC persistence balancing the contrasting effects on the chemistries in POM and MAOM imposed by monoculture CC PFTs. Thus, despite different cumulative C inputs in CC treatments from different PFTs, the total SOC stocks did not vary between CC PFTs, rather PFTs impacted whether C accumulated in POM or MAOM fractions. This highlights that CCs of different PFTs may shift the dominant SOC formation pathways (POM vs. MAOM), subsequently impacting short- and long-term SOC stabilization and stocks. Our work provides a strong applied field test of biogeochemical theory linking litter quality to pathways of C accrual in soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-and-development-of-low-power-long-range-data-acquisition-system-for-beehives-beedas&quot;&gt;Design and development of low-power, long-range data acquisition system for beehives-BeeDAS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision making capability of a system is highly dependent upon the quality and quantity of training data. Majority of beehive monitoring systems developed for research purposes are designed to collect data through a small set of sensors, and from locations with little geographic diversity. This hinders the development of a dataset that can be used to effectively train machine learning models. In this work, we explain the design and development of a multi-sensory, remote data acquisition system for beehives (BeeDAS), with focus on low-power consumption and long-range communication. We address design challenges associated with such systems and highlight the critical issues that need consideration. The proposed system enables collection of data from beehives at remote locations and harsh environment. Results of field deployments elucidate the effectiveness of various sensors which measure temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, CO2, acoustics, vibrations and the weight of a hive in hostile environment. This work also uses random forest regression to evaluate the feature importance of different sensors, environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, rain, wind speed as well as the information related to seasons, towards estimating the daily hive weight change, on a dataset comprised of 1,250 days of sensor recordings. We also evaluate the protocol designed for communication using Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT). The issues related to power optimization, sleep intervals and data storage in remote monitoring are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tillage-strategies-optimize-soc-distribution-to-reduce-carbon-footprint&quot;&gt;Tillage strategies optimize SOC distribution to reduce carbon footprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tillage methods and nitrogen (N) application are critical for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and crop production. However, both tillage and N are the main contributors to the carbon footprint (CF) in agricultural production. A 6-year-long field experiment was conducted under a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system in Northern China to test how tillage methods (RT, annual rotary tillage; DT, annual deep tillage; and TT, RT applied annually with a DT interval of two years) and N rates (300 kg ha(-1), N300; 225 kg ha(-1), N225; 165 kg ha(-1), N165) affect SOC sequestration, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and annual grain yield. And, the CF was used to evaluate ecological sustainability. RT preferentially sequestrated SOC in the 0-10 cm soil layer. In the 10-30 cm soil layers, 2.87-3.82 and 1.85-2.53 Mg ha(-1) greater SOC were respectively observed under DT and TT than RT, which was conducive to maximizing annual grain yield with less N application (N225) relative to traditional farming practice (RT-N300). Both increasing N rate and deep tillage resulted in obvious increases in the total GHG emissions. N fertilizer production and transportation were the greatest contributors, accounting for 40.4-47.0% of the total GHG emissions, followed by direct N2O and CH4 emissions (23.5-30.5%). TT-N225 significantly reduced CF (CF including SOC sequestration was 0.49 Mg CO2 eq ha(-1) year(-1) lower than DT -N225, and was 1.87 Mg CO2 eq ha(-1) year(-1) lower than RT-N300) and maintained high crop productivity while creating appropriate soil conditions and thus may be a much cleaner agricultural strategy in Northern China. And, the strategy of reducing N application in agricultural production by improving soil properties of the plow layer in this study can also be referred to in other ecological regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spatiotemporal-assessments-of-nutrients-and-water-quality-in-coastal-areas-using-remote-sensing-and-a-spatiotemporal-deep-learning-model&quot;&gt;Spatiotemporal assessments of nutrients and water quality in coastal areas using remote sensing and a spatiotemporal deep learning model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revealing the spatiotemporal variations of nutrients in coastal waters is crucial to the understanding and evaluation of coastal environment, thereby providing efficient guidance for the aquatic environmental treatment. This study proposed a spatiotemporal-incorporated deep learning model, which is easily applicable to establish the quantitative relationships between measured environmental factors and large-scale satellite maps, and can reduce estimation errors by more than 40% compared with non-spatiotemporal-incorporated deep learning model. The spatiotemporal distributions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) over 44400 km(2) of the East China Sea on 8-day scale from 2010 to 2018 were obtained. Based on the spatiotemporal variations, the water quality patterns were depicted, and the fluctuation variations of the two essential nutrients were found in the harbors with complex anthropogenic influences, in the typical estuaries with multiple river inputs, and in the open seas with important fisheries. Although the concentration of DIN and DIP decreased by 24% and 19% in 9 years, respectively, the water quality level in the inshore sea has not been significantly improved, especially in autumn and winter. Further, we quantitatively analyzed the main factors of deteriorated water and provided scientific suggestions for targeted monitoring and regional cooperative governances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-term-ecological-research-on-ecosystem-responses-to-climate-change&quot;&gt;Long-Term Ecological Research on Ecosystem Responses to Climate Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article marking the 40th anniversary of the US National Science Foundation’s Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, we describe how a long-term ecological research perspective facilitates insights into an ecosystem’s response to climate change. At all 28 LTER sites, from the Arctic to Antarctica, air temperature and moisture variability have increased since 1930, with increased disturbance frequency and severity and unprecedented disturbance types. LTER research documents the responses to these changes, including altered primary production, enhanced cycling of organic and inorganic matter, and changes in populations and communities. Although some responses are shared among diverse ecosystems, most are unique, involving region-specific drivers of change, interactions among multiple climate change drivers, and interactions with other human activities. Ecosystem responses to climate change are just beginning to emerge, and as climate change accelerates, long-term ecological research is crucial to understand, mitigate, and adapt to ecosystem responses to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responses-of-coastal-ecosystems-to-climate-change-insights-from-long-term-ecological-research&quot;&gt;Responses of Coastal Ecosystems to Climate Change: Insights from Long-Term Ecological Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coastal ecosystems play a disproportionately large role in society, and climate change is altering their ecological structure and function, as well as their highly valued goods and services. In the present article, we review the results from decade-scale research on coastal ecosystems shaped by foundation species (e.g., coral reefs, kelp forests, coastal marshes, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, barrier islands) to show how climate change is altering their ecological attributes and services. We demonstrate the value of site-based, long-term studies for quantifying the resilience of coastal systems to climate forcing, identifying thresholds that cause shifts in ecological state, and investigating the capacity of coastal ecosystems to adapt to climate change and the biological mechanisms that underlie it. We draw extensively from research conducted at coastal ecosystems studied by the US Long Term Ecological Research Network, where long-term, spatially extensive observational data are coupled with shorter-term mechanistic studies to understand the ecological consequences of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cross-site-comparisons-of-dryland-ecosystem-response-to-climate-change-in-the-us-long-term-ecological-research-network&quot;&gt;Cross-Site Comparisons of Dryland Ecosystem Response to Climate Change in the US Long-Term Ecological Research Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term observations and experiments in diverse drylands reveal how ecosystems and services are responding to climate change. To develop generalities about climate change impacts at dryland sites, we compared broadscale patterns in climate and synthesized primary production responses among the eight terrestrial, nonforested sites of the United States Long-Term Ecological Research (US LTER) Network located in temperate (Southwest and Midwest) and polar (Arctic and Antarctic) regions. All sites experienced warming in recent decades, whereas drought varied regionally with multidecadal phases. Multiple years of wet or dry conditions had larger effects than single years on primary production. Droughts, floods, and wildfires altered resource availability and restructured plant communities, with greater impacts on primary production than warming alone. During severe regional droughts, air pollution from wildfire and dust events peaked. Studies at US LTER drylands over more than 40 years demonstrate reciprocal links and feedbacks among dryland ecosystems, climate-driven disturbance events, and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;forest-and-freshwater-ecosystem-responses-to-climate-change-and-variability-at-us-lter-sites&quot;&gt;Forest and Freshwater Ecosystem Responses to Climate Change and Variability at US LTER Sites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forest and freshwater ecosystems are tightly linked and together provide important ecosystem services, but climate change is affecting their species composition, structure, and function. Research at nine US Long Term Ecological Research sites reveals complex interactions and cascading effects of climate change, some of which feed back into the climate system. Air temperature has increased at all sites, and those in the Northeast have become wetter, whereas sites in the Northwest and Alaska have become slightly drier. These changes have altered streamflow and affected ecosystem processes, including primary production, carbon storage, water and nutrient cycling, and community dynamics. At some sites, the direct effects of climate change are the dominant driver altering ecosystems, whereas at other sites indirect effects or disturbances and stressors unrelated to climate change are more important. Long-term studies are critical for understanding the impacts of climate change on forest and freshwater ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-evaluation-of-carbon-indicators-of-soil-health-in-long-term-agricultural-experiments&quot;&gt;An evaluation of carbon indicators of soil health in long-term agricultural experiments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil organic carbon (SOC) is closely tied to soil health. However, additional biological indicators may also provide insight about C dynamics and microbial activity. We used SOC and the other C indicators (potential C mineralization, permanganate oxidizable C, water extractable organic C, and beta-glucosidase enzyme activity) from the North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements to examine the continental-scale drivers of these indicators, the relationships among indicators, and the effects of soil health practices on indicator values. All indicators had greater values at cooler temperatures, and most were greater with increased precipitation and clay content. The indicators were strongly correlated with each other at the site-level, with the strongest relationship between SOC and permanganate oxidizable C. The indicator values responded positively to decreased tillage, inclusion of cover crops, application of organic nutrients, and retention of crop residue, but not the number of harvested crops in a rotation. The effect of decreased tillage on the C indicators was generally greater at sites with higher precipitation. The magnitude and direction of the response to soil health practices was consistent across indicators within a site but measuring at least two indicators would provide additional confi-dence of the effects of management, especially for tillage. All C indicators responded to management, an essential criterion for evaluating soil health. Balancing the cost, sensitivity, interpretability, and availability at commercial labs, a 24-hr potential C mineralization assay could deliver the most benefit to measure in conjunction with SOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-criterion-based-on-estimator-variance-for-model-sampling-in-precision-agriculture&quot;&gt;A new criterion based on estimator variance for model sampling in precision agriculture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model sampling has proven to be an interesting approach to optimize the sampling of an agronomic variable of interest at the field level. The use of a model improves the quality of the estimates by making it possible to integrate the information provided by one or more auxiliary data. It has been shown that such an approach gives better estimations compared to more traditional approaches.Through a statistical work describing the properties of model sampling variance, this paper details how the different factors either related to sample characteristics or to the correlation between the auxiliary data and the variable of interest, affect estimation error. The resulting equations show that the use of samples with a mean close to the field mean and with a substantial dispersion reduces the estimation variance. On the basis of these statistical considerations, a variance criterion is defined to compare sample properties. The lower the value of the criterion of a sample, the lower the variance of the estimate and the expected errors. These theoretical insights were applied to real commercial vine fields in order to validate the demonstration.Nine vine fields were considered with the objective to provide the best yield estimation. High resolution vegetative index derived from airborne multispectral image was used to drive the sampling and the estimation. The theoretical considerations were verified on the nine fields; as the observed estimation errors correspond quite well to the values predicted by the equations. The selection of a large number of random samples from these fields confirms that samples associated with higher values of the chosen criterion result, on average, in larger yield estimation errors. Samples with the highest criterion values are associated with mean estimation errors up to two times larger than those of average samples. Random sampling is also compared to two target sampling approaches (Clustering based on quantiles or on k-means algorithm) commonly considered in the literature, whose characteristics improve the value of the proposed criterion. It is shown that these sampling strategies produce samples associated with criterion values up to 100 times smaller than random sampling. The use of these easy-to-implement methods thus guarantees to reduce the variance of the estimation and the esti-mation errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ecosystem-health-ecosystem-services-and-the-well-being-of-humans-and-the-rest-of-nature&quot;&gt;Ecosystem health, ecosystem services, and the well-being of humans and the rest of nature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ecosystem is healthy if it is active, maintains its organization and autonomy over time, and is resilient to stress. Healthy ecosystems provide human well-being via ecosystem services, which are produced in interaction with human, social, and built capital. These services are affected by different ecosystem stewardship schemes. Therefore, society should be aiming for ecosystem health stewardship at all levels to maintain and improve ecosystem services. We review the relationship between ecosystem health and ecosystem services, based on a logic chain framework starting with (1) a development or conservation policy, (2) a management decision or origin of the driver of change, (3) the driver of change itself, (4) the change in ecosystem health, (5) the change in the provision of ecosystem services, and (6) the change in their value to humans. We review two case studies to demonstrate the application of this framework. We analyzed 6,131 records from the Ecosystem Services Valuation Database (ESVD) and found that in approximately 58% of the records data on ecosystem health were lacking. Finally, we describe how the United Nations’ System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) incorporates ecosystem health as part of efforts to account for natural capital appreciation or depreciation at the national level. We also provide recommendations for improving this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drought-legacies-and-ecosystem-responses-to-subsequent-drought&quot;&gt;Drought legacies and ecosystem responses to subsequent drought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of droughts. These events, which can cause significant perturbations of terrestrial ecosystems and potentially long-term impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning after the drought has subsided are often called ‘drought legacies’. While the immediate effects of drought on ecosystems have been comparatively well characterized, our broader understanding of drought legacies is just emerging. Drought legacies can relate to all aspects of ecosystem structure and functioning, involving changes at the species and the community scale as well as alterations of soil properties. This has consequences for ecosystem responses to subsequent drought. Here, we synthesize current knowledge on drought legacies and the underlying mechanisms. We highlight the relevance of legacy duration to different ecosystem processes using examples of carbon cycling and community composition. We present hypotheses characterizing how intrinsic (i.e. biotic and abiotic properties and processes) and extrinsic (i.e. drought timing, severity, and frequency) factors could alter resilience trajectories under scenarios of recurrent drought events. We propose ways for improving our understanding of drought legacies and their implications for subsequent drought events, needed to assess the longer-term consequences of droughts on ecosystem structure and functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pedogenetic-processes-operating-at-different-intensities-inferred-by-geophysical-sensors-and-machine-learning-algorithms&quot;&gt;Pedogenetic processes operating at different intensities inferred by geophysical sensors and machine learning algorithms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedogenetic processes such as ferralitization and argilluviation control various soil attributes. Understanding the intensities of pedogenesis can provide answers for several fields of environmental studies, including soil science and the geosciences. Recently, new geotechnologies such as geophysics applied to soil science and machine learning algorithms have proven to be a potential tool in pedosphere studies. In this research, we performed component principal analyses and determined the ideal number of clusters based on geophysical soil data and satellite images. Then, we used the ideal number of clusters, and ferralitization and argilluviation indices, as input data in five modeling (prediction and spatialization) algorithms to infer different ferralitization and argilluviation intensities in soils formed from the same soil parent material. The results showed that avNNet had the best model performance for modeling the clusters showing that the ideal number of clusters was three. The variables which contributed the most to the modeling were the solar diffuse radiation, topographic wetness index, and digital elevation model. The model’s specificity was greater than its sensitivity. The areas over diabase and Nitisols in the east of the study area presented greater ferralitization rates than diabase and Nitisols over western areas. On the other hand, the areas over siltite and Lixisols in the east presented greater argilluviation rates than metamorphosed siltite/siltite and Lixisols over western areas. The relief and topographic position strongly affected the evaluated pedogenetic processes, since they controlled the hydric dynamics in the area. The geophysical variables were related to soil attributes and pedogenesis, which contributed to modeling and clusterization processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;machine-learning-for-cation-exchange-capacity-prediction-in-different-land-uses&quot;&gt;Machine learning for cation exchange capacity prediction in different land uses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is a major indicator of soil quality and nutrient retention capacity. Despite the considerable progress in CEC prediction using various models, studies to develop CEC pedotransfer functions (PTFs) using machine learning algorithms precisely, such as support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF), have not yet been performed in various land uses globally. This study aims to develop, evaluate, and compare the effectiveness of RF and SVR algorithms in determining CEC in different land uses that included agriculture, plantations, grasslands, forests, fallow land and deserts in five countries (Sudan, India, Italy, Iran, and Senegal). A total of 2418 soil samples were fully analyzed and clay, silt, sand, pH, and soil organic carbon (SOC) were the selected covariates for modelling. Both RF and SVR were calibrated with a training dataset (70%, 1693 samples) and validated by the remaining data (30%, 725 samples). The performance and accuracy of both models were evaluated using the Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC), root mean square error (RMSE), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The accuracy of the modeling predictions was further analyzed via the Taylor diagram. The findings revealed that clay content showed a positive significant correlation with CEC in all land uses, with highest correlation in desert land use (r = 0.94; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Conversely, CEC was significantly and negatively correlated with sand in all land uses, with highest negative correlation obtained in desert land use (r = -0.84; p &amp;lt; 0.05). The RF algorithm was able to predict the CEC better than SVR in nearly 67% of the validated land use datasets precisely in desert (RMSE = 2.68 cmol(c) kg(-1), NRMSE = 29.9%, and LCCC = 0.94), fallow land (RMSE = 5.12 cmol(c) kg(-1), NRMSE = 55.6%, and LCCC = 0.82), forest (RMSE = 4.78 cmol(c) kg(-1), NRMSE = 78.2%, and LCCC = 0.59), and grassland (RMSE = 8.39 cmol(c) kg(-1), NRMSE = 50.5%, and LCCC = 0.84). Conversely, SVR better predicted CEC in agriculture (RMSE = 5.82 cmol(c) kg(-1), NRMSE = 57.9%, and LCCC = 0.78) and plantation (RMSE = 4.64 cmol(c) kg(-1), NRMSE = 57.9%, and LCCC = 0.74). Therefore, RF represents a promising technique to estimate soil CEC and can be used to derive effective CEC-PTFs in case of limited data availability, due to the lack of time and financial resources when the few basic soil properties are available. The findings reported in this study can be used to verify the suggested CEC-PTFs and/or their improvement. We recommend that further similar studies based on RF and SVR algorithms should consider including land use type in the Whole dataset and clay minerals in the modelling, and then compare the performance of both algorithms considering the climatic regions of the different studied countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conterminous-united-states-landsat-8-top-of-atmosphere-and-surface-reflectance-tasseled-cap-transformation-coefficients&quot;&gt;Conterminous United States Landsat-8 top of atmosphere and surface reflectance tasseled cap transformation coefficients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasseled cap transformation (TCT) has been widely used to decompose satellite multi-spectral information into “brightness”, “greenness”, and “wetness” components. Published TCT coefficients for the Landsat sensor series have mainly been derived using top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and sparse data sets. Studies to derive TCT coefficients for Landsat surface reflectance (SR) are lacking. In this study, the TCT coefficients were derived independently for Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) SR and TOA reflectance using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) method. To ensure that the derived TCT coefficients are robust and broadly applicable, representative samples of soil, vegetation, and water were selected from summer and autumn Landsat-8 OLI Analysis Ready Data (ARD) sampled from 40.4 million 30 m pixel locations across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Given that the blue band is susceptible to atmospheric contamination due to its shorter wavelength, two groups of TCT coefficients were derived: one from 6 bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2) and one from 5 bands without the blue band. As TCT results cannot be validated in a formal way, the TCT components for CONUS summer TOA and SR composites were generated and compared with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) land cover classes to provide a synoptic assessment and provide confidence in the results. In addition, three ARD tiles selected to encompass a mix of land cover types, predominantly, desert in Nevada, wetland and urban in Florida, and agriculture in North Dakota, were used to analyze the seasonal variation of the TCT components. The results demonstrate that the derived Landsat-8 TCT coefficients can effectively characterize brightness, greenness, and wetness components across the CONUS, and show good consistency for discrimination of land cover types and track seasonal surface variations. There was no significant difference between each TCT component derived using the 6-band and 5-band TCT coefficients considering a large sample of CONUS pixels. Therefore, the 5-band TCT coefficients provided in this study are recommended for use, as the blue band is atmospherically sensitive and difficult to atmospherically correct reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;statistically-rigorous-model-based-inferences-from-maps&quot;&gt;Statistically rigorous, model-based inferences from maps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistically rigorous inferences in the form of confidence intervals for map-based estimates require model-based inferential methods. Model-based mean square errors (MSE) incorporate estimates of both residual variability and sampling variability, of which the latter includes population unit variance estimates and pairwise population unit covariance estimates. Bootstrapping, which can be used with any prediction technique, provides a means of estimating the required variances and covariances. The objectives of the study were to to demonstrate a method for estimating the sampling variability, (Var) over cirucumflex(sam)((mu) over cirucumflex) that can be used with all prediction techniques, to develop an efficient method that map makers can use to disseminate metadata that facilitates calculation of (Var) over cirucumflex(sam)((mu) over cirucumflex) for arbitrary subregions of maps, and to estimate the individual contributions of sampling variability and residual variability to the overall standard error of the prediction of the population mean. The primary results were fourfold: (i) map makers must provide metadata that facilitate estimation of population unit variances and covariances for arbitrary map subregions, (ii) bootstrapping was demonstrated as an effective means of estimating the variances and covariances, (iii) the very large matrix of pairwise population unit covariances can be aggregated into a much smaller matrix that can be readily communicated by map makers to map users, and (iv) MSEs that include only estimates of residual variability and/or estimates of population unit variances, but not estimates of the pairwise population unit covariances, grossly under-estimate the actual MSEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-nix-color-sensor-and-munsell-soil-color-variables-to-classify-contrasting-soil-types-and-predict-soil-organic-carbon-in-eastern-india&quot;&gt;Using Nix color sensor and Munsell soil color variables to classify contrasting soil types and predict soil organic carbon in Eastern India&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimal soil management depends on rapid and frequent monitoring of key soil properties, which are conventionally measured in the laboratory using laborious wet-chemistry protocols. The Nix color sensor has recently exhibited promise for predicting several soil properties using soil color. This study evaluated the relationship between the Munsell Soil Color Chart (MSCC) color values of dry and ground surface soil samples to those re-ported by the Nix color sensor with (Nix(STD)) and without MSCC standardization (Nix(NON-STD)) to classify 371 samples collected from three contrasting soil types, collected from three agroclimatic zones (coastal saline zone, red and laterite zone, and Gangetic alluvial zone) and to predict soil organic carbon (OC) using different multivariate data mining algorithms. Comparing the CIEL&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;b* color values reported by the MSCC and the Nix(STD), an acceptable mean color difference (delta E&lt;em&gt;(ab)) value of 5.20 was obtained, indicating the potential accuracy of the Nix sensor. Principal component analysis efficiently clustered the soil types using the RGB variables extracted from the MSCC color chips in tandem with the Nix(STD)/Nix(NON-STD) data. Both classification tree and linear support vector machine algorithms perfectly classified all three contrasting soil types using Nix(NON-STD) data alone. Besides, the combination of the MSCC and the Nix(NON-STD) datasets produced the best OC prediction (R2 = 0.66) via random forest (RF) algorithm and indicated the potential of Nix in digital soil morphometrics. In most of the RF models, redness (a&lt;/em&gt;), yellowness (b*), and yellow (Y) variables appeared influential, presumably because of their negative correlation with OC in red and laterite soils. More research is warranted to measure the impacts of variable soil moisture and other confounding soil morphological features on the soil classification and OC prediction performance to extend the approach for classifying soil types and predicting OC in-situ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effects-of-antecedent-soil-moisture-on-rill-erodibility-and-critical-shear-stress&quot;&gt;Effects of antecedent soil moisture on rill erodibility and critical shear stress&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antecedent soil moisture is known to exert a complex, perhaps controversial, effect on rill erodibility and critical shear stress. To understand their dynamic nature as a function of antecedent soil moisture, the rill erodibility and critical shear stress for sandy loam and silty loam soil, representing coarse-grained and fine-grained soil, respectively, were measured using a hydraulic flume under six antecedent soil moisture contents, i.e., 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18%. The results show that antecedent soil moisture had a different effect on critical shear stress and rill erodibility for the two different soil textures. As antecedent soil moisture increased, rill erodibility for the finegrained soil first increased and then decreased, whereas for coarse-grained soil, rill erodibility exhibited a decreasing pattern. Conversely, as the antecedent soil moisture increased, the critical shear stress decreased first and then increased for the fine-grained soil, but for coarse-grained soil, the critical shear stress decreased after a slight increase. These different patterns can be interpreted by aggregate slaking, capillary force, soil cementation, and water separation. However, when the patterns of critical shear stress and rill erodibility were neglected, the differences in critical shear stress and rill erodibility between the coarse- and fine-grained soils were not statistically significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Therefore, indiscriminate treatments of critical shear stress and rill erodibility for different textural soils under changing antecedent soil moisture regimes may cause errors in soil erosion modeling. The relationship between rill erodibility and critical shear stress for coarse- and fine-grained soils could be fitted by a power and a polynomial function, with R-2 value of 0.94 and 0.78, respectively. Future work should include additional soil textures to study the influence of soil physical characteristics in combination with antecedent soil moisture on soil erosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-scalable-method-for-the-estimation-of-spatial-disaggregation-models&quot;&gt;A scalable method for the estimation of spatial disaggregation models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaining information about detailed processes using aggregation information is a frequent challenge in research involving geospatial data, with examples in different fields of knowledge such as agronomy, soil science, meteorology, public health, epidemiology, and others. Analyses using aggregated data lead to distorted conclusions since they disregard local patterns, and such a problem has motivated different approaches for reconstructing the information in a finer resolution from the aggregated data. However, most existing methods focus on the particular case where the volume of data does not exceed the amount of memory available for computations, a situation that has become increasingly less frequent with the fast pace of data generation nowadays. In practice, this problem limits either spatial resolution or coverage of applications, thus precluding their use in a more general context. In this paper, we address the problem of disaggregation of spatial data with huge datasets by proposing a scalable method to estimate the parameters of a well-established model. We propose an iterative scheme for model estimation and prove its convergence to a critical point of the likelihood function derived. To test the method, we provide a controlled simulation and a real example for sugarcane production in Brazil. In the simulation, the results indicate a successful reconstruction of 1 million pixels from 90 block areas. In the real example, the results had a compatible match with the agronomic literature, indicating a reasonable prediction of sugarcane production in a 100 m spatial resolution (i.e., approx. 5 x 10(8) pixels) from 5,565 block-areas. Compared to the most similar previous work, scalability allowed us to use a nearly 100 times higher resolution, which corresponds to 10,000 times more pixels. With our methods, we expect to assist researchers from different fields in disaggregating spatial information to larger areas or higher resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sub-sampling-a-large-physical-soil-archive-for-additional-analyses-to-support-spatial-mapping-a-pre-registered-experiment-in-the-southern-nations-nationalities-and-peoples-region-snnpr-of-ethiopia&quot;&gt;Sub-sampling a large physical soil archive for additional analyses to support spatial mapping; a pre-registered experiment in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of physical archives of soil material from field sampling activities has been widely recognized. If we want to use archive material for new destructive analyses to support a task, such as spatial mapping, then an efficient sub-sampling strategy is needed, both to manage analytical costs and to conserve the archive material. In this paper we present an approach to this problem when the objective is spatial mapping by ordinary kriging. Our objective was to subsample the physical archive from the Ethiopia Soil Information System (EthioSIS) survey of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) for spatial mapping of two variables, concentrations of particular fractions of selenium and iodine in the soil, which had not been measured there. We used data from cognate parts of surrounding regions of Ethiopia to estimate variograms of these properties, and then computed prediction error variances for maps in SNNPR based on proposed subsets of the archive of different size, selected to optimize a spatial coverage criterion (with some close sample pairs included). On this basis a subsample was selected. This is a preregistered experiment in that we have proposed criteria for evaluating the success of our approach, and are publishing that in advance of receiving analytical data on the subsampled material from the laboratories where they are being processed. A subsequent short report will publish the outcome. The use of preregistered trials is widely recommended and used in areas of science including public health, and we believe that it is a sound strategy to promote reproducible research in soil science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;figures-landscapes-and-landsystems-digital-locations-connectivity-and-communications-comment&quot;&gt;Figures, landscapes and landsystems: Digital locations, connectivity and communications COMMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current geomorphological research tends to give preference to landforms rather than landscapes. This commentary brings these notions closer together and incorporates varied views of ‘landscape’ (such as landscapes in art and poetry) as well as showing the difficulties of communicating them to audiences wider than geomorphology. The paper promotes the use of decimal Latitude Longitude (dLL) values to assist better location of samples, analyses and especially landforms, to produce ‘information surfaces’ within landscape and landsystem approaches to geomorphology. This will also help the development of geomorphic visual literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calibration-set-optimization-and-library-transfer-for-soil-carbon-estimation-using-soil-spectroscopy-a-review&quot;&gt;Calibration set optimization and library transfer for soil carbon estimation using soil spectroscopy-A review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource-efficient techniques for accurate soil property estimation are necessary to satisfy the increasing demand for soil data to support environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and spatial modeling. Over the last 30 yr, infrared soil spectroscopy has developed into a rapid, robust, and cost-effective technique for soil carbon analysis. Ongoing global efforts to make soil spectroscopy operational require the development of soil spectral libraries, which are the main source of data for the construction of calibration models. Understanding calibration optimization is important to ensure the efficient use of soil spectral libraries for the accurate estimation of soil carbon. Moreover, spectral library transfer can benefit new data collection, soil monitoring, and modeling efforts. This review presents techniques for optimization of calibration models and library transfer. Selection of calibration set size and subsetting are presented as current calibration optimization techniques. Moreover, spiking is discussed as an effective technique for spectral library transfer. Overall, studies have suggested that an increase in calibration size improves model performance and this continues until an optimal size is reached. Additionally, subsetting can improve model performance if the resulting subsets reduce the variability of spectrally active components. Studies have also suggested that spiking is effective when used in conjunction with subsetting techniques. These findings denote the current applicability and potential of optimization and library transfer techniques for the accurate estimation of soil carbon with soil spectroscopy. Future efforts should focus on refining optimization techniques to further expand the operability of soil spectroscopy for soil carbon estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
