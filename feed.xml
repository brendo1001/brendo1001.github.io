    &lt;p&gt;The world was in massive celebration on December 5. If you were wondering what all of that was about, it was because it was World Soil Day. Soils are great and we tend to under appreciate what they do to sustain life on planet earth. Members of our research group at the Sydney Institute of Agriculture within The University of Sydney put together a SOILinar to tell the world that soils do matter. Our SOILinar highlights some of the research we do, and is presented as a number of shortish clips by various members of our research group. Be prepared to learn something new and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Droughts and other extreme precipitation events are predicted to
increase in intensity, duration, and extent, with uncertain implications
for terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration. Soil wetting from above
(precipitation) results in a characteristically different pattern of
pore-filling than wetting from below (groundwater), with larger,
well-connected pores filling before finer pore spaces, unlike
groundwater rise in which capillary forces saturate the finest pores
first. Here we demonstrate that pore-scale wetting patterns interact
with antecedent soil moisture conditions to alter pore-scale,
core-scale, and field-scale C dynamics. Drought legacy and wetting
direction are perhaps more important determinants of short-term C
mineralization than current soil moisture content in these soils. Our
results highlight that microbial access to C is not solely limited by
physical protection, but also by drought or wetting-induced shifts in
hydrologic connectivity. We argue that models should treat soil moisture
within a three-dimensional framework emphasizing hydrologic conduits for
C and resource diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Cyanobacteria form spectacular mass occurrences almost annually in the
Baltic Sea. These harmful algal blooms are the most visible consequences
of marine eutrophication, driven by a surplus of nutrients from
anthropogenic sources and internal processes of the ecosystem. We
present a novel Cyanobacterial Bloom Indicator (CyaBI) targeted for the
ecosystem assessment of eutrophication in marine areas. The method
measures the current cyanobacterial bloom situation (an average
condition of recent 5 years) and compares this to the estimated target
level for ‘good environmental status’ (GES). The current status is
derived with an index combining indicative bloom event variables. As
such we used seasonal information from the duration, volume and severity
of algal blooms derived from earth observation (50) data. The target
level for GES was set by using a remote sensing based data set named
Fraction with Cyanobacterial Accumulations (FCA; Kahru &amp;amp; Elmgren, 2014)
covering years 1979-2014. Here a shift-detection algorithm for time
series was applied to detect time-periods in the FCA data where the
level of blooms remained low several consecutive years. The average
conditions from these time periods were transformed into respective
CyaBI target values to represent target level for GES. The indicator is
shown to pass the three critical factors set for marine indicator
development, namely it measures the current status accurately, the
target setting can be scientifically proven and it can be connected to
the ecosystem management goal. An advantage of the CyaBI method is that
it’s not restricted to the data used in the development work, but can be
complemented, or fully applied, by using different types of data sources
providing information on cyanobacterial accumulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The final product of a geologic remote sensing data analysis using multi
spectral and hyperspectral images is a mineral (abundance) map.
Multispectral data, such as ASTER, Landsat, SPOT, Sentinel-2, typically
allow to determine qualitative estimates of what minerals are in a
pixel, while hyperspectral data allow to quantify this. As input to most
image classification or spectral processing approach, endmembers are
required. An alternative approach to classification is to derive
absorption feature characteristics such as the wavelength position of
the deepest absorption, depth of the absorption and symmetry of the
absorption feature from hyperspectral data. Two approaches are
presented, tested and compared in this paper: the ‘Wavelength Mapper’
and the ‘QuanTools’. Although these algorithms use a different
mathematical solution to derive absorption feature wavelength and depth,
and use different image post-processing, the results are consistent,
comparable and reproducible. The wavelength images can be directly
linked to mineral type and abundance, but more importantly also to
mineral chemical composition and subtle changes thereof. This in turn
allows to interpret hyperspectral data in terms of mineral chemistry
changes which is a proxy to pressure-temperature of formation of
minerals. We show the case of the Rodalquilar epithermal system of the
southern Spanish Gabo de Gata volcanic area using HyMAP airborne
hyperspectral images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Socioeconomic transformation together with climate change in recent
decades significantly affected the geography of agricultural erosion in
European Russia. Calculations of erosion rate and soil loss from slopes
using logical-mathematical erosion models within different landscape
zones and administrative regions revealed spatial-temporal regularities
in the dynamics of these parameters and made it possible to assess the
role of changes in the main natural and anthropogenic factors of
erosion. A universal significant reduction in the mass of soil material
washed from tilled slopes is revealed on the background of
multidirectional changes in erosion rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Biases in climate model simulations introduce biases in subsequent
impact simulations. Therefore, bias correction methods are operationally
used to post-process regional climate projections. However, many
problems have been identified, and some researchers question the very
basis of the approach. Here we demonstrate that a typical
cross-validation is unable to identify improper use of bias correction.
Several examples show the limited ability of bias correction to correct
and to downscale variability, and demonstrate that bias correction can
cause implausible climate change signals. Bias correction cannot
overcome major model errors, and naive application might result in
ill-informed adaptation decisions. We conclude with a list of
recommendations and suggestions for future research to reduce,
post-process, and cope with climate model biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The projected loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere resulting from
climate change is a potentially large but highly uncertain feedback to
warming. The magnitude of this feedback is poorly constrained by
observations and theory, and is disparately represented in Earth system
models (ESMs)(1-3). To assess the climatological temperature sensitivity
of soil carbon, we calculate apparent soil carbon turnover times(4) that
reflect long-term and broad-scale rates of decomposition. Here, we show
that the climatological temperature control on carbon turnover in the
top metre of global soils is more sensitive in cold climates than in
warm climates and argue that it is critical to capture this emergent
ecosystem property in global-scale models. We present a simplified model
that explains the observed high cold-climate sensitivity using only the
physical scaling of soil freeze-thaw state across climate gradients.
Current ESMs fail to capture this pattern, except in anESMthat
explicitly resolves vertical gradients in soil climate and carbon
turnover. An observed weak tropical temperature sensitivity emerges in a
different model that explicitly resolves mineralogical control on
decomposition. These results support projections of strong carbon-
climate feedbacks from northern soils(5,6) and demonstrate a method for
ESMs to capture this emergent behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Identifying sand provenance in depositional aeolian environments (e.g.
dunefields) can elucidate sediment pathways and fluxes, and inform
potential land management strategies where windblown sand and dust is a
hazard to health and infrastructure. However, the complexity of these
pathways typically makes this a challenging proposition, and
uncertainties on the composition of mixed-source sediments are often not
reported. This study demonstrates that a quantitative fingerprinting
method within the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework
offers great potential for exploring the provenance and uncertainties
associated with aeolian sands. Eight samples were taken from dunes of
the small (similar to 58km(2)) Ashkzar erg, central Iran, and 49 from
three distinct potential sediment sources in the surrounding area. These
were analyzed for 61 tracers including 53 geochemical elements (trace,
major and rare earth elements (REE)) and eight REE ratios.
Kruskal-Wallis H-tests and stepwise discriminant function analysis (DFA)
allowed the identification of an optimum composite fingerprint based on
six tracers (Rb, Sr, Sr-87, (La/Yb)(n), Ga and Ce), and a Bayesian
mixing model was applied to derive the source apportionment estimates
within an uncertainty framework. There is substantial variation in the
uncertainties in the fingerprinting results, with some samples yielding
clear discrimination of components, and some with less clear
fingerprints. Quaternary terraces and fans contribute the largest
component to the dunes, but they are also the most extensive surrounding
unit; clay flats and marls, however, contribute out of proportion to
their small outcrop extent. The successful application of these methods
to aeolian sediment deposits demonstrates their potential for providing
quantitative estimates of aeolian sediment provenances in other
mixed-source arid settings, and may prove especially beneficial where
sediment is derived from multiple sources, or where other methods of
provenance (e.g. detrital zircon U-Pb dating) are not possible due to
mineralogical constraints&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Real-time de-noising of satellite-derived soil moisture observations
presents opportunities to deliver more accurate and timely satellite
data for direct satellite users. So far, the most commonly used
techniques for reducing the impact of noise in the retrieved satellite
soil moisture observations have been based on moving average filters and
Fourier based methods. This paper introduces a new alternative wavelet
based approach called Wiener-Wavelet-Based Filter (WiW), which uses an
entropy based de-noising method to design a causal version of the
filter. WiW is used as a post-retrieval processing tool to enhance the
quality of observations derived from one active (the Advanced
Scatterometer, ASCAT) and one passive (the Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer for Earth Observing System, AMSRE) satellite sensors. The
filter is then compared with two candidate de-noising techniques,
namely: i) a Wiener causal filter introduced by Su et al. (2013) and ii)
a conventional moving average filter. The validation is carried out
globally at 173 (for AMSRE) and 243 (for ASCAT) soil moisture stations.
Results show that all the three de-noising techniques can increase the
agreement between satellite and in situ measurements in terms of
correlation and signal-to-noise ratio. The Wiener-based methods show
least signal distortion and demonstrate to be conservative in retaining
the signal information in de-noised data. Importantly, the Wiener
filters can be calibrated with the data at hand, without the need for
auxiliary data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil water content is a vital resource that plays a central role in
agricultural areas. In Argentina the soybean (Glycine max (L) Merrill)
is the most important crop, considering the economic yield and the sown
area. Actually, remote sensing allows continuous monitoring of crops and
to evaluate the impact of water stress in their development. The
combination of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator that provides
information about the condition of the vegetation and surface soil
moisture content. In this study we evaluate relationships between
indicators of crop water stress and the Temperature Vegetation Dryness
Index (TVDI) determined from Landsat, for sites with rainfed soybean in
the agricultural central zone of Cordoba (Argentina).Field data were
acquired continuously throughout the whole growing season. For each
sample date and plot, data of percent green vegetation cover, soil
moisture content and phenology were registered. The use of a simulation
crop model allowed obtaining indicators of crop water stress indices:
(1) soil water deficit, (2) crop water use vs. reference crop
evapotranspiration, and (3) fraction of the available water capacity
that is readily available.The NDVI/LST spaces presented a trapezoidal
form, which indicated that TVDI will have similar sensitivity for the
full range of NDVI and showed temporal changes of wet and dry edges.When
soybean cover exceeds 60%, the combination of TVDI with (2) and (3) can
enhance the ability of detecting crop water stress conditions (R-2 =
0.62 and 0.82, respectively). However, the relationship between TVDI and
(1) showed low correlation values (R-2 = 0.21).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Towards the latter part of October 2017, i had the pleasure of, with my colleague Budiman Minasny, to conduct an intensive digital soil mapping training course in Korea for scientists in the Rural Development Agency. Also on this whirlwind trip, i attended at the Korean Soil and Fertiliser Conference. Here i delivered a keynote talk about soil carbon mapping in Australia. My colleagues, Budiman and Dominique Arrourays and Darren Kidd also presented keynotes at the conference- “Technology and Prospects of Digital Soil Mapping”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Budiman, we conducted a 2-day digital soil mapping training at the Rural Development Agency (RDA) Headquarters in Jeonju, Korea, 17-18 October 2017. The training was part of the research collaboration between the Korean National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (NAS) and the University of Sydney. It was also supported by the Australia Korea Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely following the curriculum detailed in our digital soil mapping book, attendees (whom were all RDA scientists) became knowledgeable about R for general data science work, and then acquainted with how to use R within GIS and soil mapping workflows. The workshop consisted of the nuts and bolts of digital soil mapping from preparing data, raster covariates, fitting a model and generating soil maps. For most of the attendees, this was their first time using the R software, but enthusiasm was high and we expect to see a flurry of DSM products coming out of Korea soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While RDA Korea already has a sophisticated soil information system, the workshop aimed to equip staff and scientists with generic suite of skills that underpin digital soil mapping. The workshop was opened by Dr Suk Yong Hong, chief of the Soil Survey Division at RDA, and attended by 20 staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the little downtime we had in Jeonju, we managed to have a lot around the RDA site. This was a huge complex with much land dedicated to cropping activities and trial plots. Rice and cabbage appear to be the major crops. We had a look around at their Lysimeter experiments. These things amaze me because of their scale, and the type of data that can be obtained from them. Seeing the ET reference plots reminded me that there is actual data that contribute to all the models we use. We also managed to visit the robotics lab in the engineering section of the site. This was quite interesting seeing some of their automated machinery for going up and down the rows of rice fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of our trip to Korea was to attend the annual Korean Soil and Fertilizer Conference, 19. Oct. 2017  in Chung Ju (University of Chungbuk). This event was coordinated by The NAS (National Agricultural Sciences) and titled “Technology and Prospects of Digital Soil Mapping”. The conference was opened by the president of NAS highlighting the challenge of soil mapping and agriculture in Korea. This is followed by a ceremony and award presentation for young soil scientists who will be representing the country at the global soil judging contest to be held in Brazil in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the ceremonial procedures, the international session kicked off with four keynote talks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dr Dominique Arrouays presented on GlobalSoilMap and soil monitoring in France.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prof. Budiman Minasny presented on digital soil morphometrics and its place in modern soil science practice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dr Darren Kidd presented work on enterprise suitability assessments In Tasmania&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I presented about some soil carbon mapping efforts in Australia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of giving a keynote talk. It was actually my first ever time to give such a talk. It was an enjoyable conference and many pleasant discussions were had around the posters and later on at the conference dinner where we were front and center to some excellent cultural experiences and plenty of soju.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip to Korea was thoroughly enjoyable. Our hosts were absolutely wonderful, in particular Dr. Chang Hoon Lee and Chulwoo Geoff Lee who made sure we ate well and showed us many interesting places on our travels inside the country. In am encouraged by the enthusiasm for digital soil mapping in Korea and look forward to continuing collaborative work together. There is plenty to do and plenty to learn. Geonbae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The reliable applications of soil water dynamics and its spatial
variability are very important in hydrological and environmental
studies. However, determination of some hydraulic properties requires
time and sometimes high costs. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been
applied as an alternative for the prediction of soil hydraulic
properties by working with some easily measurable physical properties.
This study examined the performance of the Splintex and Rosetta PTFs for
estimating the spatial variability of some soil hydraulic properties
such as available water capacity (AWC), field capacity (0fc), permanent
wilting point (0pwp), specific water capacity [C(0)], conductivity
[K(0)], and diffusivity [D(0)] in a sandy soil from southeastern Brazil.
Based on the log-likelihood, Akaike, and Bayesian information criteria,
semivariogram models were fitted and used to krige the assessed variable
maps. The results showed the feasibility of using these PTFs to estimate
the spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties and functions,
which would greatly benefit vadose zone flow and transport modeling.
Geostatistical analyses presented similarities in kriged maps of both
observed K(0) and C(0) data with kriged maps by Rosetta estimates, as
well as the kriged map of the observed AWC data with the kriged map by
Splintex estimates sometimes revealing the same semivariogram data
pattern. Predicted maps of 0fc, 0pwp,and D(0) were, however, different
from kriged maps of the observed data, showing that this approach should
be used carefully. The use of the range parameter from the semivariogram
models was efficient to determine the optimal sample density for the
studied area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The illuvial Bf horizon of Luvisols is characterized by coatings of clay
and organic matter (OM) at the surfaces of cracks and biopore walls. The
occurrence and distribution of OM compounds such as heterocyclic N
compounds (NCOMP) and benzonitrile and naphthalene (BN+NA) in macropore
coatings could have important effects on preferential transport
processes in structured soil. The objective of this study was to
estimate the millimeter-scale distribution of NCOMP and BN+NA at intact
surfaces of coated and uncoated cracks, pinholes, and burrow walls. The
proportions of NCOMP and BN+NA in OM were determined by pyrolysis-field
ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) from disturbed material that was
manually separated from the intact sample surfaces. Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance mode (DRIFT) and partial
least squares regression (PLSR) between DRIFT signals and Py-FIMS data
were used to generate millimeter-scale maps of predicted NCOMP and BN+NA
proportions at intact macropore surfaces. The NCOMP and BN+NA
proportions were linearly related to C=O and C=C groups from OM and to
O-H groups from clay minerals in DRIFT spectra. The millimeter-scale
distribution of NCOMP and BN+NA at intact macropore surfaces could be
predicted in terms of relative differences among the macropore types.
Increased NCOMP and BN+NA proportions corresponded to the spatial
distribution of crack coatings and pinholes. The relative enrichment
suggested that pyrogenic OM has been preferentially transported in
cracks rather than in biopores and that it was stabilized by clay
minerals and prevented from decomposition. The results indicated that
preferential transport affects OM turnover processes in the subsoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Agricultural practices such as crop rotation affect soil physical,
chemical and biological properties. Legumes crop effect has been shown
to provide several agro-ecological services as a cereal previous crop.
The aim of the present field study was to estimate the middle term
effects of introducing faba bean in crop rotation on the structure and
function of soil microbial communities. Two experimental rotation
systems were tested (i) Wheat-Beet-Faba Bean-Rape-Wheat (Leg(+)) and
(ii) Wheat-Flax-Wheat-Beet-Wheat (Leg(-)). Soil samples were collected
on tilled plots at 0-10 cm depth on July 2013 under wheat. Soil
microbial biomass and soil enzymatic activities (beta-glucosidase,
cellulase, urease and arylamidase activities) were assessed. Soil
microbial diversity was evaluated with two complementary approaches:
Phospholipid fatty acid profiling (PLFA) and the metabolic capabilities
of the microbial community (Biolog Ecoplates). Soil organic carbon and
total nitrogen were significantly and respectively 1.5 and 1.3 times
higher in faba bean’s rotation compared to free faba bean rotation. Soil
microbial biomass did not differ significantly between the two
rotations. In general, Leg(+) rotation resulted in the greatest carbon
mineralization and beta-glucosidase and arylamidase activities. The
analysis of Biolog data and PLFA profiling indicated that the rotation
including faba bean has modified microbial populations and induced
differences in the catabolic capability of soil microbial communities.
Our results suggested that changing rotation crop by introducing faba
bean two years before wheat modifies the surrounding habitat of
microbial communities by providing available carbon and nitrogen as well
as suitable soil pH. This new habitat could impact the structure of
microbial communities and their functions. Leg (+) rotation seems to be
a suitable practice promoting microbial activities in agricultural
plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The soil microbial activity is a key parameter in numerous studies
aiming to assess soil quality in agricultural plots. Basal Soil
Respiration (BSR) has been extensively used as an indicator of this soil
microbial activity. However, available methods to measure BSR remain
time-and labor-consuming and must be performed in the laboratory which
may lead to result distortion due to the needed soil pre-treatments. The
SituResp (R) method was developed to assess BSR in a time-and
cost-effective way. This method was adapted from a laboratory
methodology, the MicroResp (TM) method, in order to be implemented in
the field on fresh soil samples. It is based on the color change of a
pH-sensitive gel in reaction to the CO2 concentration change in the
headspace of a soil sample over the 24-h incubation. This study presents
the calibration and validation of the SituResp (R) method in laboratory
conditions, and a comparison in the field with the Solvita (R) tool, a
comparable method used by agricultural scientists and advisors. The
results of the calibration showed a high correlation between the air CO2
concentration and the absorbance variation of the gel at 570 nm (R-2 =
0.95). The validation against the titration alkali-trap method, on 21
soil samples, showed a strong correlation between the two methods (R-2 =
0.90). In the field test on 9 agricultural-plots, the SituResp (R)
method yielded similar results to the Solvita (R) tool. The SituResp (R)
method is therefore a reliable method for performing a cheap, rapid but
efficient assessment of soil microbial activity in the field which could
be included in soil quality monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil-borne pathogens cause great crop losses in agriculture. Because of
their resilience in the soil, these pathogens persist in a population
reservoir, causing future outbreaks of crop diseases. Management focus
is usually on the most common pathogens occurring, but it is likely that
a mixed population of pathogens together affect crops. Next generation
sequencing of DNA from environmental samples can provide information on
the presence of potential pathogens. The aim of this study was to obtain
insight into the factors that drive the composition of potential plant
pathogen populations in agricultural soils. To this end, the alpha and
beta diversity of fungal OTUs that were assigned as potential plant
pathogens for 42 agricultural soils were assessed. The presented study
is the first inventory of the pool of pathogens and its correlating
factors. The results of this inventory indicate that the composition of
pathogens in soil is driven by pH, soil type, crop history, litter
saprotrophic fungi and spatial patterns. The major driving factors
differed between potential root-and shoot-infecting fungi, suggesting
interactions among environmental factors and pathogen traits like
reproduction, survival and dispersal. This information is important to
understand risks for disease outbreaks and to recommend management
strategies to prevent such outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Real-time de-noising of satellite-derived soil moisture observations
presents opportunities to deliver more accurate and timely satellite
data for direct satellite users. So far, the most commonly used
techniques for reducing the impact of noise in the retrieved satellite
soil moisture observations have been based on moving average filters and
Fourier based methods. This paper introduces a new alternative wavelet
based approach called Wiener-Wavelet-Based Filter (WiW), which uses an
entropy based de-noising method to design a causal version of the
filter. WiW is used as a post-retrieval processing tool to enhance the
quality of observations derived from one active (the Advanced
Scatterometer, ASCAT) and one passive (the Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer for Earth Observing System, AMSRE) satellite sensors. The
filter is then compared with two candidate de-noising techniques,
namely: i) a Wiener causal filter introduced by Su et al. (2013) and ii)
a conventional moving average filter. The validation is carried out
globally at 173 (for AMSRE) and 243 (for ASCAT) soil moisture stations.
Results show that all the three de-noising techniques can increase the
agreement between satellite and in situ measurements in terms of
correlation and signal-to-noise ratio. The Wiener-based methods show
least signal distortion and demonstrate to be conservative in retaining
the signal information in de-noised data. Importantly, the Wiener
filters can be calibrated with the data at hand, without the need for
auxiliary data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil water content is a vital resource that plays a central role in
agricultural areas. In Argentina the soybean (Glycine max (L) Merrill)
is the most important crop, considering the economic yield and the sown
area. Actually, remote sensing allows continuous monitoring of crops and
to evaluate the impact of water stress in their development. The
combination of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator that provides
information about the condition of the vegetation and surface soil
moisture content. In this study we evaluate relationships between
indicators of crop water stress and the Temperature Vegetation Dryness
Index (TVDI) determined from Landsat, for sites with rainfed soybean in
the agricultural central zone of Cordoba (Argentina).Field data were
acquired continuously throughout the whole growing season. For each
sample date and plot, data of percent green vegetation cover, soil
moisture content and phenology were registered. The use of a simulation
crop model allowed obtaining indicators of crop water stress indices:
(1) soil water deficit, (2) crop water use vs. reference crop
evapotranspiration, and (3) fraction of the available water capacity
that is readily available.The NDVI/LST spaces presented a trapezoidal
form, which indicated that TVDI will have similar sensitivity for the
full range of NDVI and showed temporal changes of wet and dry edges.When
soybean cover exceeds 60%, the combination of TVDI with (2) and (3) can
enhance the ability of detecting crop water stress conditions (R-2 =
0.62 and 0.82, respectively). However, the relationship between TVDI and
(1) showed low correlation values (R-2 = 0.21).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The “trapezoid” or “triangle” model constitutes the most popular
approach to remote sensing (RS) of surface soil moisture based on
coupled thermal (Le., land surface temperature) and optical RS
observations. The model, hereinafter referred to as Thermal-OptiCal
TRAapezoid Model (TOTRAM), is based on interpretation of the pixel
distribution within the land surface temperature - vegetation index
(LST-VI) space. TOTRAM suffers from two inherent limitations. It is not
applicable to satellites that do not provide thermal data (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and it requires parameterization for each individual
observation date. To overcome these restrictions we propose a novel
Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on the linear physical
relationship between soil moisture and shortwave infrared transformed
reflectance (SIR) and is parameterized based on the pixel distribution
within the SIR-VI space. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture
estimates derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations for the
Walnut Gulch and Little Washita watersheds were compared with ground
truth soil moisture data. Results indicate that the prediction
accuracies of OPTRAM and TOTRAM are comparable, with OPTRAM only
requiring observations in the optical electromagnetic frequency domain.
The volumetric moisture content estimation errors of both models were
below 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) with local calibration and about 0.04-0.05 cm(3)
cm(-3) without calibration. We also demonstrate that OPTRAM only
requires a single universal parameterization for a given location, which
is a significant advancement that opens a new avenue for remote sensing
of soil moisture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Agricultural land cover is characterized by strong variations within
relatively short time intervals. These dynamics are challenging for land
cover classifications on the one hand, but deliver crucial information
that can be used to improve the classifiers performance on the other
hand. Since up to date mapping of crops is crucial to assess the impact
of agricultural land use on the ecosystems, an accurate and complete
classification of crop types is of high importance. In the presented
study, a new multitemporal data based classification approach was
developed that incorporates knowledge about the phenological changes on
crop lands. It identifies phenological sequence patterns (PSP) of the
crop types based on a dense stack of Sentinel-1 data and accurate
information about the plant’s phenology. The performance of the
developed methodology has been tested for two different vegetation
seasons using over 200 ground truth fields located in northern Germany.
The results showed that a dense time series of Sentinel-1 images allowed
for high classification accuracies of grasslands, maize, canola, sugar
beets and potatoes (F1-score above 0.8) using PSP as well as standard
(Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood) classification method. The PSP
approach clearly outperformed standard methods for cereal crops,
especially for spring barley where the F1-score varied between zero and
0.43 for standard approaches, while PSP achieved values as high as 0.74
and 0.79 for both vegetation seasons. The PSP based approach also
outperformed for oat, winter barley and rye. Furthermore, the PSP
classification is more resilient to differences in farming management
and conditions of growth since it takes information about each crop
types’ growing stage and its growing period into consideration. The
results also indicate, that the PSP approach was more sensitive to
subtle changes such as the proportion of weeds within a field&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Understanding how soil variability changes with spatial scale is
critical to our ability to understand and model soil processes at scales
relevant to decision makers. The compilation of large legacy data sets
has opened up new possibilities to model spatial variability at the
continental or even global scale. Using the National Soil Site Collation
(NSSC) dataset of Australia we created empirical variograms for sand and
clay fraction at extents from 1 km to continental. The NSSC dataset is
highly spatially clustered; a typical feature of legacy datasets. This
leads to lumpy artefacts in the variograms. To reduce this lumpiness we
employed grid based declustering. We used the declustered empirical
variograms to calculate the Hausdorff Besicovitch Dimension - a unitless
measure of spatial roughness. We first fit a power model to each
declustered variogram and calculated the Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension
at each modelled scale. This allowed us to assess the roughness or
variability at each modelled extent, however this assessment was
somewhat arbitrary and showed that roughness depends on the extent. We
have proposed a new model that allows us to calculate the Hausdorff
Besicovitch dimension continuously across all extents. The conceptual
basis of this model moves away from a multi-fractal framework typically
used by soil scientists. It allows us to describe spatial variability or
stochasticity as a continuous function of spatial separation. Both our
new model and the continental scale variograms of texture emphasise the
high degree of short range variability in soil texture. Empirical
variograms indicate that around 50% of spatial variability occurs at &amp;lt;
10 km, and 30% at &amp;lt; 1 km. Spatial variability of soil texture increases
with depth consistently across all modelled extents. Beyond extents of
around 100 km, the Hausdorff Besicovitch Dimension remains relatively
stable. Soil spatial variability is highly stochastic at fine scales
however it changes gradually with extent and scale rather than abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We present a contextual spatial modelling (CSM) framework, as a
methodology for multiscale, hierarchical mapping and analysis. The aim
is to propose and evaluate a practical method that can account for the
complex interactions of environmental covariates across multiple scales
and their influence on soil formation. Here we derived common terrain
attributes from multiscale versions of a DEM based on up-sampled octaves
of the Gaussian pyramid. Because the CSM approach is based on a
relatively small set of scales and terrain attributes it is efficient,
and depending on the regression algorithm and the covariates used in the
modelling, the results can be interpreted in terms of soil formation.
Cross-validation coefficient of determination modelling (R-2), for
predictions of clay and silt increased from 0.38 and 0.16 when using the
covariates derived at the original DEM resolution to 0.68 and 0.63,
respectively, when using CSM. These results are similar to those
achieved with the hyperscale covariates of ConMap and ConStat. As with
these hyperscale covariates, the multiscale covariates derived from the
Gaussian scale space in CSM capture the observed spatial dependencies
and interactions of the landscape and soil. However, some advantages of
CSM approach compared to ConMap and ConStat are i) a reduced set of
scales that still manage to represent the entire extent of the range of
scales, ii) a reduced set of attributes at each scale, iii) more
efficient computation, and iv) better interpretability of the important
covariates used in the modelling and thus of the factors that affect
soil formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Since the end of World War One, only few research is performed to
understand the extent of the destruction of the first meters of soil
archive at the former Belgian front zone. The only existing sources
identifying the by artillery destroyed landscape are maps indicating
destruction at the level of administrative communities, based on war
damage inventories. Even a century after the war, there is a need to
gain more detail in the historical destruction at a landscape or parcel
scale. Unlike in neighboring country France, the Belgian authorities
allowed a complete repopulation of the front zone, which results in an
ongoing confrontation between ground workers (farmers, construction
workers, archaeologists, etc.), the war’s heritage (trenches, bunkers,
graves, etc.) and its dangers (unexploded ordnances, UXO). Metal
shrapnel and the high rate of unexploded shells (up to 30% of the fired
projectiles) are typical remnants of this trench warfare. The
localization of these phenomena is also useful to simulate the extent of
the war’s environmental impact and the intensity of possible UXO-finds.
To inventorize destruction and the related metal shrapnel pollution
(MSP), we propose a new mapping method based on a sampling strategy to
digitize shelling densities, derived from historical aerial photographs.
This data source allows us to characterize almost every single parcel in
this mainly agricultural area. By classifying the derived shelling
densities, destruction classes can be distinguished to describe the
impact on landscape and soil archive. The translation of the destruction
map into a map indicating the level of buried metal shrapnel, was
possible due to the direct relation between shells, metal shrapnel and
shell holes. A validation with the buried metal objects was performed
with metal parameters derived from electromagnetic induction field
surveys. These scan results indicated a strong relation between shelling
densities and the buried metal clutter. Based on the findings in this
research, we offer tools to create an accurate destruction map that can
be directly related to the occurrence of WW1 relicts within the soil
archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Models that require inputs of soil texture are often limited by the
availability of soil information. While texture class is easier to
obtain than particle size, texture classes do not represent the
continuum of soil size fractions. Soil texture class and clay percentage
are collected as a standard practice for many land management agencies
(e.g., NRCS, BLM, FAO) and clay content is frequently estimated with
acceptable accuracy (+/- 5%). When clay and texture class is known, sand
and silt can be constrained to a narrow range that may differ from the
geometric centroid of a given texture class (gcent). I tested the
concept of a modified centroid approach (mcent) using 75,736 soil
samples from the National Cooperative Soil Survey pedon database that
also had measured hydraulic soil properties. Comparisons were made using
the Rosetta pedotransfer function (PTF) to test modeled values from
gcent, mcent, and measured data in comparison with measured values of
water content at field capacity (theta(330)) and wilting point
(theta(15000)). The mcent approach produced a continuous distribution of
values for sand and silt whereas gcent produced a stair-step pattern for
each of the 12 texture classes. Rosetta underestimated water content.
Error metrics were similar when all texture classes were combined, but
differences between models emerged when individual texture classes were
compared. Results support the practice of collecting field estimates of
clay percentage along with texture class to expand the use of soil
profile data for both spatial and non-spatial modeling of soil processes
that will advance our understanding of soil contributions to ecosystem
function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil health (SH) refers to the ability of a soil to function and provide
ecosystem services. The Comprehensive Assessment of Soil Health (CASH)
is an approach that measures 15 physical, biological, and chemical soil
indicators, which are interpreted through scoring functions. This study
reports on the SH status of 5767 samples from the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest,
and Northeast regions of the USA as evaluated using CASH. Descriptive
statistics and ANOVAs of subdatasets by region and soil textural group
for SH indicators, in addition to correlation coefficients, principal
component (PC) analysis, and best subsets regression (BSR) were
performed. From these analyses, new CASH scoring functions were
developed. Separate scoring functions by textural group (fine, medium,
coarse) were necessary for Wet Aggregate Stability (WAS), Available
Water Capacity (AWS), Organic Matter (OM), Active Carbon (AC), and
Protein. Differences existed among regions, especially for WAS, OM,
Protein, and Respiration (Resp), where the Midwest had relatively lower
mean values compared to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Biological
properties and WAS showed moderately strong correlations (r = 0.58-0.78)
and the highest loadings for the first two PCs. BSR results using the
overall soil quality index as the response variable indicated that AC
accounts for 45% of the variation, with additional predictability from
Penetration Resistance, Resp, and WAS (68%). These four indicators are
suggested for simplified SH tests. We conclude that the CASH approach
can be successfully applied to evaluate the health status of soils with
differing pedogenetic histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The method of luminescent microscopy has been applied to study the
structure of the microbial biomass of soils and soil-like bodies in East
(the Thala Hills and Larsemann Hills oases) and West (Cape Burks, Hobbs
coast) Antarctica. According to Soil Taxonomy, the studied soils mainly
belong to the subgroups of Aquic Haploturbels, Typic Haploturbels, Typic
Haplorthels, and Lithic Haplorthels. The major contribution to their
microbial biomass belongs to fungi. The highest fungal biomass (up to
790 mu g C/g soil) has been found in the soils with surface organic
horizons in the form of thin moss/lichen litters, in which the
development of fungal mycelium is most active. A larger part of fungal
biomass (70-98%) is represented by spores. For the soils without
vegetation cover, the accumulation of bacterial and fungal biomass takes
place in the horizons under surface desert pavements. In the upper parts
of the soils without vegetation cover and in the organic soil horizons,
the major part (&amp;gt; 60%) of fungal mycelium contains protective melanin
pigments. Among bacteria, the high portion (up to 50%) of small
filtering forms is observed. A considerable increase (up to 290.2 +/- 27
mu g C/g soil) in the fungal biomass owing to the development of yeasts
has been shown for gley soils (gleyzems) developing from sapropel
sediments under subaquatic conditions and for the algal-bacterial mat on
the bottom of the lake (920.7 +/- 46 mu g C/g soil). The production of
carbon dioxide by the soils varies from 0.47 to 2.34 mu g C-CO2/(g day).
The intensity of nitrogen fixation in the studied samples is generally
low: from 0.08 to 55.85 ng D&lt;inverted exclamation=&quot;&quot;&gt;(2)De(4)/(g day). The
intensity of denitrification varies from 0.09 to 19.28 mu g N-N2O/(g
day).&lt;/inverted&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Laboratory analytical methods suitable for the determination of the
hydrocarbon status of soils (a specific soil characteristic involving
information on the total content and qualitative features of soluble
(bitumoid) carbonaceous substances and individual hydrocarbons
(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, etc.) in bitumoid, as well
as the composition and content of hydrocarbon gases) have been
considered. Among different physicochemical methods of study, attention
is focused on the methods suitable for the wide use.
Luminescence-bituminological analysis, low-temperature
spectrofluorimetry (Shpolskii spectroscopy), infrared (IR) spectroscopy,
gas chromatography, chromatography-mass spectrometry, and some other
methods have been characterized, as well as sample preparation features.
Advantages and limitations of each of these methods are described; their
efficiency, instrumental complexity, analysis duration, and accuracy are
assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil moisture monitoring networks can provide real-time and accurate
soil moisture measurements; however, missing values and the lack of
unified measurement depths across different networks impedes soil
moisture applications at regional and national scales. Therefore,
methods for vertical extrapolation of soil moisture, i. e., using
shallow soil moisture measurements to estimate deeper soil moisture, are
needed for standardizing measurements to a set of common depths. This
study compared three methods, artificial neural network (ANN), linear
regression (LR), and exponential filter (ExpF), for vertical
extrapolation of soil moisture using data from the Oklahoma Mesonet.
Based on our analysis of intra-annual variations in soil moisture, we
divided each year into two seasons, warm and cool. Our results
demonstrate that all methods perform better in the warm season than in
the cool season, especially at deeper depths. The Kling-Gupta efficiency
was used to assess the performance of each method. All methods had
similar performance for near-surface extrapolation of soil moisture (top
25 cm). Although the accuracy of all models tended to decrease with
depth, the ExpF outperformed the other methods at deeper depths. The
soil water index (SWI) is preferred over volumetric water content as
input to the ExpF. Incorporating air temperature and an antecedent
precipitation index into the ANN and LR methods did not significantly
improve their accuracy. We demonstrated that both ExpF and general LR
can be used for SWI extrapolation at sites where only surface soil
moisture data are available. Soil properties may be useful for further
improving the accuracy of the general LR method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
A series of experiments and related numerical simulations were carried
out to study one-dimensional water redistribution processes in an
unsaturated soil. A long horizontal Plexiglas box was packed as
homogenously as possible with sand. The sandbox was divided into two
sections using a very thin metal plate, with one section initially fully
saturated and the other section only partially saturated. Initial
saturation in the dry section was set to 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 in three
different experiments. Redistribution between the wet and dry sections
started as soon as the metal plate was removed. Changes in water
saturation at various locations along the sandbox were measured as a
function of time using a dual-energy gamma system. Also, air and water
pressures were measured using two different kinds of tensiometers at
various locations as a function of time. The saturation discontinuity
was found to persist during the entire experiments, while observed water
pressures were found to become continuous immediately after the
experiments started. Two models, the standard Richards equation and an
interfacial area model, were used to simulate the experiments. Both
models showed some deviations between the simulated water pressures and
the measured data at early times during redistribution. The standard
model could only simulate the observed saturation distributions
reasonably well for the experiment with the lowest initial water
saturation in the dry section. The interfacial area model could
reproduce observed saturation distributions of all three experiments,
albeit by fitting one of the parameters in the surface area production
term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Management zones can be defined as homogeneous regions for which
specific management decisions are to be considered. The delineation of
these management units is important because it enables or at least
facilitate growers and practitioners performing site specific
management. The delineation of management zones has essentially been
performed by (i) clustering techniques or (ii) segmentation algorithms
arising from the image processing domain. However, the first approach
does not take into account the spatial relationships in the data, and is
prone to generate a large number of fragmented zones while he second
methodology has only been dedicated to regularly-spaced, within-field
data. This work proposes a new approach to generate contiguous
management zones from irregularly-spaced within-field observations, e.g.
within-field yield, soil conductivity, soil samples, which are a very
important source of data in precision agriculture studies. A seeded
region growing and merging algorithm has been specifically designed for
these irregularly-spaced observations. More specifically, a Voronoi
tessellation was implemented to define spatial relationships between
neighbouring observations. Seeds were automatically placed at specific
locations across the fields and management zones were first expanded
from these seeds. The merging procedure aimed at generating more
manageable and interpretable zones. The merging algorithm was defined in
a way that made it possible to incorporate machinery and technical
management constraints. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed
methodology was able to generate relatively compact and contiguous
management zones. Furthermore, machinery and technical constraints were
shown to significantly influence the results of the delineation which
proved the importance of accounting for these considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Climatic, atmospheric, and land-use changes all have the potential to
alter soil microbial activity, mediated by changes in plant inputs. Many
microbial models of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition have been
proposed recently to advance prediction of climate and carbon (C)
feedbacks. Most of these models, however, exhibit unrealistic
oscillatory behavior and SOC insensitivity to long-term changes in C
inputs. Here we diagnose the source of these problems in four archetypal
models and propose a density-dependent formulation of microbial
turnover, motivated by community-level interactions, that limits
population sizes and reduces oscillations. We compare model predictions
to 24 long-term C-input field manipulations and identify key benchmarks.
The proposed formulation reproduces soil C responses to long-term
C-input changes and implies greater SOC storage associated with
CO2-fertilization-driven increases in C inputs over the coming century
compared to recent microbial models. This study provides a simple
modification to improve microbial models for inclusion in Earth System
Models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Landform delineation has long been used in digital soil mapping to infer
soil-relevant information. While its potential as an environmental
variable in soil parameter modeling has been investigated for various
automated landform delineations, little research has been invested into
the relationship between the delineation of land forms by algorithms
based on digital terrain models (DTM) and the perception of landforms by
the soil surveyor during field work. Five Open Source automated landform
classification algorithms and a support vector machine classifier based
on single terrain parameters are investigated with regard to their
ability to replicate topographic position, at two different scales, as
described by surveyors for soil profile sites in the Alpine environment
of South Tyrol. We also analyse how the variation of parameters and cell
size affects the distribution of the computed landforms. While a clear
trend regarding grid cell size and window size can be observed with
regard to the difference between macro and meso scale topographic
positions, the overall classification accuracy regarding the different
topographic position classes was less promising. Although some automated
classifications partly resemble the surveyor’s classification, a
considerable number of issues remain to be investigated in order to
explain the lack of reproducibility of surveyor position, some of which
are linked to the Alpine environment of the study area. These include
the dominance of the backslope position, the objectivity of the surveyor
in rugged terrain under forest cover, and the fuzzy nature of
classifying topographic position, especially in steep terrain. By
applying a forward stepwise feature selection procedure for a model
based on single terrain parameters, we show that at macro scale a
regional terrain parameter (topographic wetness index) and curvatures at
a coarse DTM resolution of 50 m are the most influential in
distinguishing topographic position, whereas at meso scale it is the
topographic position index (TPI) with a search radius of just 70 m
combined with slope gradient. This study is an important first step
towards consolidating topographic perception during field survey and
digital terrain analysis, which, at least in Alpine terrain, still
requires more investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Assessment of soil health involves determining how well a soil is
performing its biological, chemical, and physical functions relative to
its inherent potential. Due to high cost, labor requirements, and soil
disturbance, traditional laboratory analyses cannot provide high
resolution soil health data. Therefore, sensor-based approaches are
important to facilitate cost-effective, site-specific management for
soil health. In the Central Claypan Region of Missouri, USA, visible and
near-infrared (VNIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy has successfully
been used to estimate biological components of soil health as well as
Soil Management Assessment Franiework (SMAF) scores. In contrast,
estimation models for important chemical and physical aspects of soil
health have been less successful with VNIR spectroscopy. The primary
objective of this study was to apply a sensor fusion approach to
estimate soil health indicators and SMAF scores using VNIR spectroscopy
in conjunction with soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), and
penetration resistance measured by cone penetrometer (i.e., cone index,
CI). Soil samples were collected from two depths (0-5 and 5-15 cm) at
108 locations within a 10-ha research site encompassing different
cropping systems and landscape positions. Soil health measurements and
VNIR spectral data were obtained in the laboratory, while CI and ECa
data were obtained in situ. Calibration models were developed with
partial least squares (PLS) regression and model performance was
evaluated using coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square
error (RMSE). Models integrating ECa and CI with VNIR reflectance data
improved estimates of the overall SMAF score (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 7.21%)
relative to VNIR alone (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 8.41%), reducing RMSE by 14%.
Improved models were also achieved for estimates of the individual
chemical, biological, and physical soil health scores, demonstrating
reductions in RMSE of 2.8, 5.4, and 10.0%, respectively. The results of
this study illustrate the potential for rapid quantification of soil
health by fusing VNIR sensor data with auxiliary data obtained from
complementary sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Identifying and halting the decline of High Nature Value farmland (HNV)
is seen as essential to the EU meeting its 2020 biodiversity targets.
Data on HNV farmland is used to target policy instruments and monitor
changes in HNV to assess policy impact and development. Initial
estimates of HNV land were based on land cover data with limited spatial
resolution. The EU has since taken a distributed approach, allowing
countries to develop their own data and metrics to report on the
presence of HNV land, and changes to it. Land cover type has been the
main data used for reporting but no consistent set of data metrics have
been agreed. Therefore, there is interest in both developing
standardised reporting metrics and identifying land with high
restoration potential to increase the area of HNV land. We explore the
relationship between soil associations and broad habitats across a
member state (Wales) to determine if any discernible patterns exist
between soil and habitat diversity and if soils information might be
useful for identifying areas with high restoration potential. We
developed a set of criteria to identify soil abundance, combining soil
diversity with ecological rare species approaches. The rare (&amp;lt; 1000 ha)
and occasional (1000-10,000 ha) soils identified were associated with
significantly higher levels of habitat diversity than the national
average. We propose that soil diversity information could supplement
habitat information in identifying areas of potential restoration
interest. Two iconic areas of Wales, the Llyn Peninsula and Conwy
Valley, were compared for restoration potential. Soil diversity in both
areas is higher than the national average; habitat diversity was
average, or lower in the case of the Llyn Peninsula. These areas with
higher soil diversity offer greater potential for restoration to type-2
HNV. Soil diversity and habitat diversity were found to be positively
correlated at a national level despite major management modification of
habitats. Given this relationship it is proposed that soil diversity
information offers useful metrics alongside land cover data for
identifying or comparing areas with regard to potential restoration for
HNV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are regulated by the complex
interplay of climatic, edaphic and biotic conditions. However, the
interrelation of SOC and these drivers and their potential connection
networks are rarely assessed quantitatively. Using observations of SOC
dynamics with detailed soil properties from 90 field trials at 28 sites
under different agroecosystems across the Australian cropping regions,
we investigated the direct and indirect effects of climate, soil
properties, carbon (C) inputs and soil C pools (a total of 17 variables)
on SOC change rate (r(C), Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Among these variables, we
found that the most influential variables on r(C) were the average C
input amount and annual precipitation, and the total SOC stock at the
beginning of the trials. Overall, C inputs (including C input amount and
pasture frequency in the crop rotation system) accounted for 27% of the
relative influence on r(C), followed by climate 25% (including
precipitation and temperature), soil C pools 24% (including pool size
and composition) and soil properties (such as cation exchange capacity,
clay content, bulk density) 24%. Path analysis identified a network of
intercorrelations of climate, soil properties, C inputs and soil C pools
in determining r(C). The direct correlation of r(C) with climate was
significantly weakened if removing the effects of soil properties and C
pools, and vice versa. These results reveal the relative importance of
climate, soil properties, C inputs and C pools and their complex
interconnections in regulating SOC dynamics. Ignorance of the impact of
changes in soil properties, C pool composition and C input (quantity and

    &lt;p&gt;The Pedometrics conference was held in Wageningen, The Netherlands during the latter part on June 2017. This was my first ever attendance to a Pedometrics conference. The occasion was made more special due to the fact that it was a celebration of sorts for Pedometrics. Pedometrics is the domain of soil science that uses quantitative methods to understand soils and how that exist, function and change. The first Pedometrics conference occurred in 1992, and also in Wageningen. This meant that in addition to the usual scientific discussions, there was a sense of reflection and celebration of Pedometrics turning 25 throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pedometrics-2017&quot;&gt;Pedometrics 2017&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post predominantly just contains photos and captions of the events during the conference. Some other people have put together more lengthy blogs of their own account of the Pedometrics conference. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedirtdoctors.com/pedometrics-conference-blog/&quot;&gt;Grant Campbell’s blog&lt;/a&gt; is one such example. I am really thankful to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ackermans.net/&quot;&gt;Guy Ackermans&lt;/a&gt; who extended me permission to use his photographs that he captured throughout the duration of the conference. I am thankful for this because: 1. photographic skill is something I don’t possess, and 2. I don’t think I could have captured all the happenings of the conference in the way these photos do. There are many more photos of the Pedometrics conference by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fotoarchief.net/pedometrics/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I have merely selected a few that I personally enjoyed most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the details of the conference can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pedometrics2017.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Some details about Pedometrics in general can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometrics&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1. The conference bag had some nice goodies in it that included a small battery pack for phone charging. The group photo proved to be a success in terms of herding people and arranging them accordingly. I was getting worried though as it started to rain just when the photos started being taken, but that did not deter the significance of this occasion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-conference-workshops&quot;&gt;Pre-conference workshops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been good to attend any of the ones on offer. I was informed that all were well attended. I think its great that opportunities for training be offered at conferences. It helps demystify things a bit and gives students and up and coming scientists to actively participate in proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really high quality keynotes were had. They either made me realize the possibilities of pedometrics. Not only the what can we do now, but also the what should we be doing and where should we be headed types of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poster-presentations&quot;&gt;Poster Presentations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two poster sessions. Each was prefaced by a poster pitch session where the presenters could summarize their research in 60 seconds to the sitting audience. This is a good concept i reckon. I thought the quality of the posters in general was very high and thought some of the work should have been given speaking slots at the conference rather than being designated as just a poster. At least they were able to do a pitch though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to pitch and present my poster at the second poster session, and it can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/06/Pedometrics2017&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pedometrics-25th-birthday-celebrations&quot;&gt;Pedometrics 25th Birthday Celebrations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of time was dedicated to celebrating 25 years of Pedometrics. Alex McBratney and Jaap de Gruijter, the two people largely responsible for establishing Pedometrics, provided a fresh and funny summary and outlook of this domain of soil science. Their short movies were particularly good. It was amazing to see how such contrasting individuals in their persona could work together. It was clear that both Alex and Jaap were more than just colleagues, but great friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intro-movie&quot;&gt;Intro movie&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other great talks in this session included that from Murray Lark (the mathematical conscience of Pedometrics) and David Rossiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-events&quot;&gt;Social Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedometrics 2017 had the usual pre-conference drinks and conference dinner. There were also a number of other events too. For example i think there was a tour of the World Soil Museum and a tour of some local beer making establishments. I was able to participate in the games of touch rugby and football. These were highly fun games, except for the part where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/john-triantafilis&quot;&gt;John Triantafilis&lt;/a&gt; blatently fouled me and discrupted a certain goal (possibly:) ).  I also participated in the early morning running events that were organised by Jetse Stoorvogel. On these we got to see some sites and interesting landscapes in and around the town of Wageningen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-university-of-sydney&quot;&gt;The University of Sydney&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Sydney was very well represented at Pedometrics where we had over 10 people. This says a lot about the flavor of soil science research we conduct in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the conference and all its offerings. I was particularly busy throughout it with many duties that included two presentations, a poster presentation and chairing a session. I had plenty of fun and really enjoyed the morning runs and the football match. I get the feeling now that Pedometrics is now on the cusp of moving in a new direction. I think that direction is in the integration with scientific domains other than just soil science. The natural sciences seem to be getting more and more multi-disciplinary and Pedometrics has a lot to offer in terms of quantifying soil functions and processes that will be invaluable for such studies into microbial systems, ecosystem studies and monitoring programs. I very much look forward to 2019 when the next conference is due to happen in Canada. Proost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In this paper, we describe the parallelization of three complex and
computationally intensive modules of GRASS GIS using the OpenMP
application programming interface for multi-core computers. These
include the v.surf.rst module for spatial interpolation, the r.sun
module for solar radiation modeling and the r.sim.water module for water
flow simulation. We briefly describe the functionality of the modules
and parallelization approaches used in the modules. Our approach
includes the analysis of the module’s functionality, identification of
source code segments suitable for parallelization and proper application
of OpenMP parallelization code to create efficient threads processing
the subtasks. We document the efficiency of the solutions using the
airborne laser scanning data representing land surface in the test area
and derived high-resolution digital terrain model grids. We discuss the
performance speed-up and parallelization efficiency depending on the
number of processor threads. The study showed a substantial increase in
computation speeds on a standard multi-core computer while maintaining
the accuracy of results in comparison to the output from original
modules. The presented parallelization approach showed the simplicity
and efficiency of the parallelization of open-source GRASS GIS modules
using OpenMP, leading to an increased performance of this geospatial
software on standard multi-core computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The amount of reactive N in soils on the Australian continent appears to
be increasing, mainly because of biological N-fixation by permanent
pastures in the dryland farming zone. This gain is partly offset by
N-mining by crops, which we estimate have removed between one-fifth and
one-quarter of the original soil N. The vast areas of non-agricultural
land and arid rangelands appear to be in neutral N balance and the
relatively small area of intensive agriculture is in negative balance.
There are regional N losses from the sugar and dairy industries to
groundwater, estuaries and lagoons, including the Great Barrier Reef.
Fertiliser N application is increasing, and is likely to increase
further, to compensate for the soil-N mining and to meet increasing crop
yield potential, but fertiliser-N represents a relatively small fraction
of the Australian N balance. The dryland farming zone utilises the
largest amounts of native and fertiliser N. The average fertiliser
application to dryland cereals and oilseeds, 45kg N ha(-1), is low by
international standards because of the small N-demand by dryland crops
and because there are no subsidies on crops or fertiliser that promote
overuse. The efficiency of N-use is relatively low, for example about
40% of fertiliser N is recovered in the aboveground parts of dryland
wheat and the rest is retained in the soil, denitrified or otherwise
lost. We suggest further research on fertiliser-application methods to
increase crop recovery of fertiliser, as well as research to reduce the
surplus N from permanent pasture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Operating rules have been used widely to decide reservoir operations
because of their capacity for coping with uncertain inflow. However,
stationary operating rules lack adaptability; thus, under changing
environmental conditions, they cause inefficient reservoir operation.
This paper derives adaptive operating rules based on time-varying
parameters generated using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). A
deterministic optimization model is established to obtain optimal water
releases, which are further taken as observations of the reservoir
simulation model. The EnKF is formulated to update the operating rules
sequentially, providing a series of time-varying parameters. To identify
the index that dominates the variations of the operating rules, three
hydrologic factors are selected: the reservoir inflow, ratio of future
inflow to current available water, and available water. Finally,
adaptive operating rules are derived by fitting the time-varying
parameters with the identified dominant hydrologic factor. China’s Three
Gorges Reservoir was selected as a case study. Results show that (1) the
EnKF has the capability of capturing the variations of the operating
rules, (2) reservoir inflow is the factor that dominates the variations
of the operating rules, and (3) the derived adaptive operating rules are
effective in improving hydropower benefits compared with stationary
operating rules. The insightful findings of this study could be used to
help adapt reservoir operations to mitigate the effects of changing
environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE&lt;/em&gt;, 140 88-102; AUG 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The world of viticulture connected to wine making has become a very
important activity in many inland areas permitting both the generation
of important income and the sustaining of agriculture systems.Recent
progress in both crop modeling and Decision Support Systems (DSS)
applied to viticulture promises important changes that combine both high
quality production and environmental sustainability. However, most of
this progress is only addressed at the farm level and does not challenge
the viticulture landscape, which is a key issue when facing DOC, DOCG
areas, wine growers’ cooperatives and consortiums and strategic
viticulture planning.Thus, this paper aims to demonstrate that a new
type of DSS, which is developed on a Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure
(GCI) platform, may provide an important web-based operational tool for
high quality viticulture as it connects farm and landscape levels
better.The GCI platform supports acquisition, management, processing of
both static and dynamic data (e.g. pedological, daily climatic, and
vineyard distribution), data visualization, and on-the-fly computer
applications in order to perform simulation modeling (e.g. grapevine
water stress, evaluation of ecosystem services, etc.). These are all
potentially accessible via the Web.This is possible thanks to the
implementation of a set of modeling clusters that is strongly rooted in
soil-plant-atmosphere and physically based simulation modeling.The DSS
tool, applied to an area of 20,000 ha in Southern Italy, is designed to
address viticulture planning and management by providing operational
support for farmers, farmer associations and decision makers involved in
the viticulture landscape.Output of the system includes viticulture
planning and management scenario analysis, maps and evaluation of
potential and current plant water stress.The tool will also be
demonstrated through a short selection of practical case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper presents an ontological approach of scientific experimental
data integration across complementary sub-domains, i.e., agricultural
production and food processing, with an application to viticulture and
winemaking. The two main steps in this approach are (i) to integrate
preexisting ontologies to create a so-called ontology network and (ii)
to populate the ontology network with experimental data from various
sources. The Agri-Food Experiment Ontology (AFEO), a new ontology
network, was developed, based on two ontological resources, i.e., AEO
(Ontology for Agricultural Experiments) and OFPE (Ontology for Food
Processing Experiments). It contains 136 concepts which cover various
viticulture practices, as well as winemaking products and operations.
AFEO was used to guide the data integration of two different data
sources, i.e., viticulture experimental data stored in a relational
database, and winemaking experimental data stored in Microsoft Excel
files. Two applications illustrate the approach. The first one is on
wine traceability and the second one is related to the influence of
irrigation practices and winemaking methods on GSH concentration in
wine. These examples show that data integration guided by an ontology
network can provide researchers with the information necessary to
address extended research questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT&lt;/em&gt;, 192 45-57; APR 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Remote sensing observations are extensively used for analysis of
environmental variables. These variables often exhibit spatial
correlation, which has to be accounted for in the calibration models
used in predictions, either by direct modelling of the dependencies or
by allowing for spatially correlated stochastic effects. Another feature
in many remote sensing instruments is that the derived predictor
variables are highly correlated, which can lead to unnecessary model
over-training and at worst, singularities in the estimates. Both of
these affect the prediction accuracy, especially when the training set
for model calibration is small. To overcome these modelling challenges,
we present a general model calibration procedure for remotely sensed
data and apply it to airborne laser scanning data for forest inventory.
We use a linear regression model that accounts for multicollinearity in
the predictors by principal components and Bayesian regularization. It
has a spatial random effect component for the spatial correlations that
are not explained by a simple linear model. An efficient Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling scheme is used to account for the uncertainty in
all the model parameters. We tested the proposed model against several
alternatives and it outperformed the other linear calibration models,
especially when there were spatial effects, multicollinearity and the
training set size was small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a powerful tool in the investigation of soil
organic matter (SOM) due to its ability to dissolve minerals but not
break the chemical bonds of organic matter. These properties make the
use of HF a common pretreatment step for removing paramagnetic
interferences and concentrating carbon prior to solid-state C-13 NMR
spectroscopy with the working assumption that any SOM lost during HF
treatment will not bias the resulting NMR spectra. Hydrofluoric acid is
also used to isolate a mineral-stabilized OM fraction with the working
assumption that most mineral-stabilized OM is primarily low molecular
weight compounds bound to mineral surfaces and when the minerals are
dissolved in HF, the OM bound to these surfaces will be lost to
solution. The working assumptions behind these two uses of HF
dissolution appear to be contradictory. To address this apparent
conundrum, we treated a number of simple organic compounds, soil and
sediment samples with HF in 2 and 10% concentrations and tracked C and N
loss as well as chemical shifts observed in solid-state 13C NMR spectra.
For the soil and sediment samples there were inconsistent C and N losses
but no difference in loss between the 2% and 10% HF concentrations.
There were no obvious soil properties that could explain the differences
in C or N loss. Overall, there were significant shifts in NMR-observable
organic chemistry after treatment with both 2 and 10% HF with anoxic
fine grained sediments under a seagrass meadow exhibiting strong
preferential loss of O-alkyl C while terrestrial soils generally lost OM
with more of a mixed chemical character. For many samples, the degree of
selective loss was enough to significantly bias the interpretation of OM
composition. Given the lack of ability to explain the large differences
in C loss between samples with observed soil properties, this study
suggests that caution should be used when interpreting HF-soluble C to
indicate a mineral-stabilized fraction without considering the soil
physicochemical environment and putative mechanisms for organo-mineral
associations in that particular soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Subsoils store &amp;gt; 50 % of the total global soil organic carbon (SOC), and
low SOC content and high mean residence times indicate that subsoils
have the potential to sequester additional C on the long-term.
Nevertheless, the mechanisms controlling the turnover of SOC in subsoils
are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of
temperature and substrate limitation on subsoil SOC turnover and
evaluate the stability of additional C inputs in subsoils.In a 63-day
microcosm incubation experiment, CO2 production of undisturbed soil
samples from topsoil and two subsoil depth increments was measured at
two different temperatures (10 degrees C and 20 degrees C).
Additionally, C-13 labeled root litter was added to the different
samples and measurements of the isotopic signature of the respired CO2
allowed a differentiation between SOC mineralization and root
mineralization. The CO2 production per unit soil mass was lower in deep
subsoil than in the topsoil, but the CO2 production per unit SOC
(specific mineralization) was three times higher in the deepest subsoil
than in topsoil. This depth gradient of specific mineralization in
undisturbed samples indicates that deep subsoil contained relatively
more labile SOC than the topsoil. The temperature sensitivity of SOC
mineralization expressed as Q(10-q), decreased from around 3 to around 1
with increasing soil depth. In contrast, the mineralization of the added
root material was solely determined by the recalcitrance of the added
roots as indicated by a similar Q(10-q) through all three soil
depths.Contrary to the SOC mineralization of undisturbed samples,
significantly more added root litter was mineralized in the samples from
the upper horizons than in the deepest subsoil samples, revealing a
non-linear relationship between mineralization of added C and the SOC
content. Thus, the distance between substrate units, as indicated by the
SOC content, may be key factor for subsoil SOC dynamics. Moreover, root
addition caused no positive priming effects in subsoil horizons
indicating that enhanced C inputs to the subsoil can increase the SOC
content and tap the unused C storage potential of subsoils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Crop residue addition is a way to increase soil organic matter (SOM)
level in croplands. However, organic matter input and SOM stocks are not
linearly related. Consequently, adding high amounts of residues, such as
straw, may increase SOM to only a small extent, and an alternative use
of the residues may be justified. The objective of this study was to
test how the level and type (above- or belowground) of residue addition
affect SOM stabilization. We hypothesise that (1) root residues will be
mineralised slower than leaf and stalk residues, (2) soil aggregate
formation will increase with high additions, and (3) wheat residue
addition will induce positive priming, with the magnitude depending on
the residue level and type. Homogeneously C-13-labelled wheat residues
(leaves, stalks, roots) were added to a silt-loam soil at levels of 1.40
and 5.04 g DM kg(-1) and CO2 release and delta C-13 signature were
measured over 64 days at 20 degrees C. Water-stable macroaggregates (&amp;gt;
250 mu m), microaggregates (53-250 mu m) and silt plus clay size
fractions (&amp;lt; 53 mu m) were separated and C-13 incorporation from residue
was quantified in each fraction after 64 days. Aggregate formation
generally increased with added residue amount, but the proportion of
residues occluded within aggregates decreased with increasing addition
level. The occlusion of residues from aboveground biomass was more
reduced with addition level than that of roots. Residue mineralisation
increased with the addition level, but this increase was less for roots
compared to stalks and leaves. Priming effects were similar between
residue types and mainly depended on the added amount: SOM
mineralisation increased by 50% and 90% at low and high addition levels,
respectively. We conclude that the proportion of residues physically
protected within aggregates decreases and priming effects increase with
increasing C input leading to decreasing rate of long-term C
stabilization within SOM by increasing residue addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This study evaluated the effectiveness of dry ashing of soils and
subsequent spectral subtraction procedure in comparison with alternative
chemical methods in accentuating organics for diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopic analysis of soil
organic matter composition. Chemical oxidation of soil with sodium
hypochlorite (NaOC1) and demineralisation by hydrofluoric acid (HF)
treatment were assessed as possible alternatives to the dry ashing
method. Surface samples (0-10 cm) of four contrasting soils i.e.,
Ferralsol, Luvisol, Vertisol and Solonetz were used in the study. We
observed the spectral changes before and after pre-treatments using
DRIFT spectroscopy of bulk soils and their respective four separated
density fractions (&amp;lt;1.8,1.8-2.2, 2.2-2.6, and &amp;gt;2.6 g cm(-3)). Dry ashing
of soils altered the absorption bands of gibbsite and goethite in the
Ferralsol; however, phyllosilicate bands in the Luvisol, Vertisol and
Solonetz remained largely unaffected. The organic bands were
incompletely removed by the dry ashing method and shifts in some major
organic bands were also noticed. Thus the accuracy of the dry ashed
spectral subtraction was limited due to the mineral and organic bands
alteration. The Na0C1 treatment oxidised labile organic carbon (OC)
(e.g., aliphatics) without any mineral alteration, but the rest of the
OC fractions remained largely unaffected. Therefore, the result of
spectral subtraction of the Na0C1 treated samples from original spectra
was ambiguous. The HF treatment removed minerals efficiently from both
bulk soils and density fractions, which noticeably highlighted the
organic bands with little or no mineral interferences in the spectra of
the treated samples. HF treatment also removed a small portion of the
total OC that was associated with minerals. We conclude that HF
treatment was more effective than dry ashing and Na0C1 oxidation to
accentuate organics in the soil DRIFT spectra, since it provided mineral
interference free spectra with in general least affected organic bands.
Thus, HF treatment of soil offers a potential pretreatment method for
improved spectroscopic characterisation of soil.organic matter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Long residence times of soil organic matter have been attributed to
reactive mineral surface sites that sorb organic species and cause
inaccessibility due to physical isolation and chemical stabilization at
the organic-mineral interface. Instrumentation for probing this
interface is limited. As a result, much of the micron-and
molecular-scale knowledge about organic-mineral interactions remains
largely qualitative. Here we report the use of force spectroscopy to
directly measure the binding between organic ligands with known chemical
functionalities and soil minerals in aqueous environments. By
systematically studying the role of organic functional group chemistry
with model minerals, we demonstrate that chemistry of both the organic
ligand and mineral contribute to values of binding free energy and that
changes in pH and ionic strength produce significant differences in
binding energies. These direct measurements of molecular binding provide
mechanistic insights into organo-mineral interactions, which could
potentially inform land-carbon models that explicitly include
mineral-bound C pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Virtual globes have been developed to showcase different types of data
combining a digital elevation model and basemaps of high resolution
satellite imagery. Hence, they became a standard to share spatial data
and information, although they suffer from a lack of toolboxes dedicated
to the formatting of large geoscientific dataset. From this perspective,
we developed Geolokit: a free and lightweight software that allows
geoscientists - and every scientist working with spatial data to import
their data (e.g., sample collections, structural geology,
cross-sections, field pictures, georeferenced maps), to handle and to
transcribe them to Keyhole Markup Language (KML) files. KML files are
then automatically opened in the Google Earth virtual globe and the
spatial data accessed and shared. Geolokit comes with a large number of
dedicated tools that can process and display: (i) multi-points data,
(ii) scattered data interpolations, (iii) structural geology features in
2D and 3D, (iv) rose diagrams, stereonets and dip-plunge polar
histograms, (v) cross-sections and oriented rasters, (vi) georeferenced
field pictures, (vii) georeferenced maps and projected
gridding.Therefore, together with Geolokit, Google Earth becomes not
only a powerful georeferenced data viewer but also a stand-alone work
platform. The toolbox (available online at https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/aYDOBJiAr3QgF2?domain=geolokit.org) is
written in Python, a high-level, cross-platform programming language and
is accessible through a graphical user interface, designed to run in
parallel with Google Earth, through a workflow that requires no
additional third party software. Geolokit features are demonstrated in
this paper using typical datasets gathered from two case studies
illustrating its applicability at multiple scales of investigation: a
petro-structural investigation of the Ile d’Yeu orthogneissic unit
(Western France) and data collection of the Mariana oceanic subduction
zone (Western Pacific).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Drumlins are ubiquitous landforms in previously glaciated regions,
formed through a series of complex sub glacial processes operating
underneath the paleo-ice sheets. Accurate delineation and
characterization of drumlins are essential for understanding the
formation mechanism of drumlins as well as the flow behaviors and basal
conditions of paleo-ice sheets. Automated mapping of drumlins is
particularly important for examining the distribution patterns of
drumlins across large spatial scales. This paper presents an automated
vector-based approach to mapping drumlins from high-resolution light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The rationale is to extract a set of
concentric contours by building localized contour trees and establishing
topological relationships. This automated method can overcome the
shortcomings of previously manual and automated methods for mapping
drumlins, for instance, the azimuthal biases during the generation of
shaded relief images. A case study was carried out over a portion of the
New York Drumlin Field. Overall 1181 drumlins were identified from the
LiDAR-derived DEM across the study region, which had been underestimated
in previous literature. The delineation results were visually and
statistically compared to the manual digitization results. The
morphology of drumlins was characterized by quantifying the length,
width, elongation ratio, height, area, and volume. Statistical and
spatial analyses were conducted to examine the distribution pattern and
spatial variability of drumlin size and form. The drumlins and the
morphologic characteristics exhibit significant spatial clustering
rather than randomly distributed patterns. The form of drumlins varies
from ovoid to spindle shapes towards the downstream direction of paleo
ice flows, along with the decrease in width, area, and volume. This
observation is in line with previous studies, which may be explained by
the variations in sediment thickness and/or the velocity increases of
ice flows towards ice front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Monitoring agricultural land is important for understanding and managing
food production, environmental conservation efforts, and climate change.
The United States Department of Agriculture’s Cropland Data Layer (CDL),
an annual satellite imagery-derived land cover map, has been
increasingly used for this application since complete coverage of the
conterminous United States became available in 2008. However, the CDL is
designed and produced with the intent of mapping annual land cover
rather than tracking changes over time, and as a result certain
precautions are needed in multi-year change analyses to minimize error
and misapplication. We highlight scenarios that require special
considerations, suggest solutions to key challenges, and propose a set
of recommended good practices and general guidelines for CDL-based land
change estimation. We also characterize a problematic issue of crop area
underestimation bias within the CDL that needs to be accounted for and
corrected when calculating changes to crop and cropland areas. When used
appropriately and in conjunction with related information, the CDL is a
valuable and effective tool for detecting diverse trends in agriculture.
By explicitly discussing the methods and techniques for
post-classification measurement of land-cover and land-use change using
the CDL, we aim to further stimulate the discourse and continued
development of suitable methodologies. Recommendations generated here
are intended specifically for the CDL but may be broadly applicable to
additional remotely-sensed land cover datasets including the National
Land Cover Database (NLCD), Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land cover products, and other regional,
national, and global land cover classification maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Crop residue addition is a way to increase soil organic matter (SOM)
level in croplands. However, organic matter input and SOM stocks are not
linearly related. Consequently, adding high amounts of residues, such as
straw, may increase SOM to only a small extent, and an alternative use
of the residues may be justified. The objective of this study was to
test how the level and type (above- or belowground) of residue addition
affect SOM stabilization. We hypothesise that (1) root residues will be
mineralised slower than leaf and stalk residues, (2) soil aggregate
formation will increase with high additions, and (3) wheat residue
addition will induce positive priming, with the magnitude depending on
the residue level and type. Homogeneously C-13-labelled wheat residues
(leaves, stalks, roots) were added to a silt-loam soil at levels of 1.40
and 5.04 g DM kg(-1) and CO2 release and delta C-13 signature were
measured over 64 days at 20 degrees C. Water-stable macroaggregates (&amp;gt;
250 mu m), microaggregates (53-250 mu m) and silt plus clay size
fractions (&amp;lt; 53 mu m) were separated and C-13 incorporation from residue
was quantified in each fraction after 64 days. Aggregate formation
generally increased with added residue amount, but the proportion of
residues occluded within aggregates decreased with increasing addition
level. The occlusion of residues from aboveground biomass was more
reduced with addition level than that of roots. Residue mineralisation
increased with the addition level, but this increase was less for roots
compared to stalks and leaves. Priming effects were similar between
residue types and mainly depended on the added amount: SOM
mineralisation increased by 50% and 90% at low and high addition levels,
respectively. We conclude that the proportion of residues physically
protected within aggregates decreases and priming effects increase with
increasing C input leading to decreasing rate of long-term C
stabilization within SOM by increasing residue addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil health (SH) refers to the ability of a soil to function and provide
ecosystem services. The Comprehensive Assessment of Soil Health (CASH)
is an approach that measures 15 physical, biological, and chemical soil
indicators, which are interpreted through scoring functions. This study
reports on the SH status of 5767 samples from the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest,
and Northeast regions of the USA as evaluated using CASH. Descriptive
statistics and ANOVAs of subdatasets by region and soil textural group
for SH indicators, in addition to correlation coefficients, principal
component (PC) analysis, and best subsets regression (BSR) were
performed. From these analyses, new CASH scoring functions were
developed. Separate scoring functions by textural group (fine, medium,
coarse) were necessary for Wet Aggregate Stability (WAS), Available
Water Capacity (AWS), Organic Matter (OM), Active Carbon (AC), and
Protein. Differences existed among regions, especially for WAS, OM,
Protein, and Respiration (Resp), where the Midwest had relatively lower
mean values compared to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Biological
properties and WAS showed moderately strong correlations (r = 0.58-0.78)
and the highest loadings for the first two PCs. BSR results using the
overall soil quality index as the response variable indicated that AC
accounts for 45% of the variation, with additional predictability from
Penetration Resistance, Resp, and WAS (68%). These four indicators are
suggested for simplified SH tests. We conclude that the CASH approach
can be successfully applied to evaluate the health status of soils with
differing pedogenetic histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Aeolian and fluvial processes are important agents for shaping the
surface of the Earth, but are largely studied in isolation despite there
being many locations where both processes are acting together and
influencing each other. Using field data to investigate fluvial-aeolian
interactions is, however, hampered by our short length of record and low
temporal resolution of observations. Here we use numerical modelling to
investigate, for the first time, the interplay between aeolian (sand
dunes) and fluvial (river channel) processes. This modelling is carried
out by combining two existing cellular models of aeolian and fluvial
processes that requires considerable consideration of the different
process representation and time stepping used. The result is a fully
coupled (in time and space) sand dune river model. Over a thousand-year
simulation the model shows how the migration of sand dunes is readily
blocked by rivers, yet aeolian processes can push the channel downwind.
Over time cyclic channel avulsions develop indicating that aeolian
action on fluvial systems may play an important part in governing
avulsion frequency, and thus alluvial architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Accurate estimation of the crop coefficient (K-c) is crucial for
estimating actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) and planning appropriate
irrigation management for efficient crop yield. In this study,
satellite-based K-c values were estimated at cropland and mixed forest
sites based on the dual crop coefficient approach using merged soil
moisture from the European Space Agency as an indicator of evaporation
from soil, as well as the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the
Leaf Area Index (LAI) to explain the effect of transpiration from
plants. Comparison of the seasonal patterns and Pearson’s correlation
coefficient (r) of NDVI, LAI, and surface soil moisture with K-c
indicated that it was reasonable to use the three variables as
independent variables to estimate K-c. Based on these results, the
satellite -based K-c estimated using NDVI, LAI, and soil moisture (Case
1) was compared with the K-c calculated from NDVI and LAI (Case 2) and
the flux towers at the significance level of 0.05. The statistical
results confirmed that the K-c estimated from Case 1 (Bias: -0.012 to
0.053, RMSE: 0.144 to 0.172, and r: 0.463 to 0.800) showed better
agreement with the observed K-c than that estimated from Case 2 (Bias:
-0.058 to 0.088, RMSE: 0.146 to 0.221, and r: 0.434 to 0.788). Among the
three variables, soil moisture had the greatest impact on the rice
paddy, while the NDVI showed the highest influence on the mixed forest.
Based on these results, K-c estimated from Case 1 was multiplied by
MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based potential
crop evapotranspiration and compared with the latent heat flux from flux
towers. ETa showed reasonable bias (cropland: -0.224 to 1.364, mixed
forest: 0.711 to 1.055), RMSE (cropland: 1.952 to 2.126, mixed forest:
1.085 to 1.878) and r (cropland: 0.529 to 0.832, mixed forest: 0.850 to
0.909) at all of the study sites. After validation of the satellite
-based K-c approach under various vegetation types and climate
conditions, this approach can be employed not only for developing
adequate water and agricultural management plans, but also for analyzing
and predicting crop yield productivity and agricultural drought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes tools and technologies to identify
in-field soil and crop variability for improving farming practices and
optimizing agronomic inputs. Traditionally, optical remote sensing (RS)
that utilizes visible light and infrared regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum has been used as an integral part of PA for crop and soil
monitoring. Optical RS, however, is slow in differentiating stress
levels in crops until visual symptoms become noticeable. Surface
temperature is considered to be a rapid response variable that can
indicate crop stresses prior to their visual symptoms. By measuring
estimates of surface temperature, thermal RS has been found to be a
promising tool for PA. Compared to optical RS, applications of thermal
RS for PA have been limited. Until recently (i.e., before the
advancement of low cost RS platforms such as unmanned aerial systems
(UAVs)), the availability of high resolution thermal images was limited
due to high acquisition costs. Given recent developments in UAVs,
thermal images with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become
available at a low cost, which has increased opportunities to understand
in-field variability of crop and soil conditions useful for various
agronomic decision-making. Before thermal RS is adopted as a routine
tool for crop and environmental monitoring, there is a need to
understand its current and potential applications as well as issues and
concerns. This review focuses on current and potential applications of
thermal RS in PA as well as some concerns relating to its application.
The application areas of thermal RS in agriculture discussed here
include irrigation scheduling, drought monitoring, crop disease
detection, and mapping of soil properties, residues and tillage, field
tiles, and crop maturity and yield. Some of the issues related to its
application include spatial and temporal resolution, atmospheric
conditions, and crop growth stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Most soil structure-related physical properties are correlated to soil
organic carbon (SOC) content. Texture, mineralogy, and SOC:clay ratio
are also acknowledged to affect physical properties, however there is no
consensus or general conclusions in this respect. Against this
background, the present study aims at determining objectives for the
management of SOC in terms of structural quality of agricultural soils.
The large area in which 161 free-to-swell undisturbed samples were
obtained for this research represents a major part of the Swiss
agricultural land and belongs to one broad soil group (Cambi-Luvisols).
The structural quality was scored visually, and bulk volumes (inverse of
bulk density) were measured at standard matric potentials. To define the
effect of SOC without interference of soil mechanical degradation, soils
with good structural quality scores were considered first in studying
the relationship between SOC and soil pore volumes. Results suggest that
the relationship is always linear, irrespective of the clay content of
the soils. No optimum of SOC corresponding to a fraction of the clay
content is found, contrary to the theory of “complexed organic carbon”
(Dexter et al., 2008). However, the SOC:clay ratio decreases with
decreasing soil structure quality. The SOC:clay ratio of 1:8 is the
average for a very good structure quality. A SOC:clay ratio of 1:10 is
the limit between good and medium structural quality,, thus it
constitutes a reasonable goal for soil management by farmers. A SOC:clay
ratio of 1:8 or smaller leads to a high probability of poor structural
state. These ratios can be used as criteria for soil structural quality
and SOC management, and in that context, the concept of complexed
organic carbon appears relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Species distributions are often simplified to binary representations of
the ranges where they are present and absent. It is then common to look
for changes in these ranges as indicators of the effects of climate
change, the expansion or control of invasive species or the impact of
human land-use changes. We argue that there are inherent problems with
this approach, and more emphasis should be placed on species relative
abundance rather than just presence. The sampling effort required to be
confident of absence is often impractical to achieve, and estimates of
species range changes based on survey data are therefore inherently
sensitive to sampling intensity. Species niches estimated using
presence-absence or presence-only models are broader than those for
abundance and may exaggerate the viability of small marginal sink
populations. We demonstrate that it is possible to transform models of
predicted probability of presence to expected abundance if the sampling
intensity is known. Using case studies of Antarctic mosses and temperate
rain forest trees, we demonstrate additional insights into biotic change
that can be gained using this method. While species becoming locally
extinct or colonising new areas are extreme and obviously important
impacts of global environmental change, changes in abundance could still
signal important changes in biological systems and be an early warning
indicator of larger future changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Phosphorus (P) availability in soils limits crop yields in many regions
of the World, while excess of soil P triggers aquatic eutrophication in
other regions. Numerous processes drive the global spatial distribution
of P in agricultural soils, but their relative roles remain unclear.
Here, we combined several global data sets describing these drivers with
a soil P dynamics model to simulate the distribution of P in
agricultural soils and to assess the contributions of the different
drivers at the global scale. We analysed both the labile inorganic P
(PILAB), a proxy of the pool involved in plant nutrition and the total
soil P (PTOT). We found that the soil biogeochemical background
corresponding to P inherited from natural soils at the conversion to
agriculture (BIOG) and farming practices (FARM) were the main drivers of
the spatial variability in cropland soil P content but that their
contribution varied between PTOT vs. PILAB. When the spatial variability
was computed between grid cells at half-degree resolution, we found that
almost all of the PTOT spatial variability could be explained by BIOG,
while BIOG and FARM explained 38% and 63% of PILAB spatial variability,
respectively. Our work also showed that the driver contribution was
sensitive to the spatial scale characterizing the variability (grid cell
vs. continent) and to the region of interest (global vs. tropics for
instance). In particular, the heterogeneity of farming practices between
continents was large enough to make FARM contribute to the variability
in PTOT at that scale. We thus demonstrated how the different drivers
were combined to explain the global distribution of agricultural soil P.
Our study is also a promising approach to investigate the potential
effect of P as a limiting factor for agroecosystems at the global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Since the introduction of the cosmic-ray neutron method for soil
moisture estimation, numerous studies have been conducted to test and
advance the accuracy of the method. Almost 200 stationary neutron
detector systems have been installed worldwide, and roving systems have
also started to gain ground. The intensity of low-energy neutrons
produced by cosmic rays, measured above the ground surface, is sensitive
to soil moisture in the upper decimeters of the ground within a radius
of hectometers. The method has been proven suitable for estimating soil
moisture for a wide range of land covers and soil types and has been
used for hydrological modeling, data assimilation, and calibration and
validation of satellite products. The method is challenged by the effect
on neutron intensity of other hydrogen pools such as vegetation, canopy
interception, and snow. Identifying the signal of the different pools
can be used to improve the cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture method as
well as extend the application to, e.g., biomass and canopy interception
surveying. More fundamental research is required for advancement of the
method to include more energy ranges and consider multiple height
levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has utilized a set
of core validation sites as the primary methodology in assessing the
soil moisture retrieval algorithm performance. Those sites provide well
calibrated in situ soil moisture measurements within SMAP product grid
pixels for diverse conditions and locations. The estimation of the
average soil moisture within the SMAP product grid pixels based on in
situ measurements is more reliable when location specific calibration of
the sensors has been performed and there is adequate replication over
the spatial domain, with an up-scaling function based on analysis using
independent estimates of the soil moisture distribution. SMAP fulfilled
these requirements through a collaborative Cal/Val Partner program. This
paper presents the results from 34 candidate core validation sites for
the first eleven months of the SMAP mission. As a result of the
screening of the sites prior to the availability of SMAP data, out of
the 34 candidate sites 18 sites fulfilled all the requirements at one of
the resolution scales (at least). The rest of the sites are used as
secondary information in algorithm evaluation. The results indicate that
the SMAP radiometer-based soil moisture data product meets its expected
performance of 0.04 m(3)/m(3) volumetric soil moisture (unbiased root
mean square error); the combined radar-radiometer product is close to
its expected performance of 0.04 m(3)/m(3), and the radar-based product
meets its target accuracy of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) (the lengths of the combined
and radar-based products are truncated to about 10 weeks because of the
SMAP radar failure). Upon completing the intensive Cal/Val phase of the
mission the SMAP project will continue to enhance the products in the
primary and extended geographic domains, in co-operation with the
Cal/Val Partners, by continuing the comparisons over the existing core
validation sites and inclusion of candidate sites that can address
shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Assessment of soil health involves determining how well a soil is
performing its biological, chemical, and physical functions relative to
its inherent potential. Due to high cost, labor requirements, and soil
disturbance, traditional laboratory analyses cannot provide high
resolution soil health data. Therefore, sensor-based approaches are
important to facilitate cost-effective, site-specific management for
soil health. In the Central Claypan Region of Missouri, USA, visible and
near-infrared (VNIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy has successfully
been used to estimate biological components of soil health as well as
Soil Management Assessment Franiework (SMAF) scores. In contrast,
estimation models for important chemical and physical aspects of soil
health have been less successful with VNIR spectroscopy. The primary
objective of this study was to apply a sensor fusion approach to
estimate soil health indicators and SMAF scores using VNIR spectroscopy
in conjunction with soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), and
penetration resistance measured by cone penetrometer (i.e., cone index,
CI). Soil samples were collected from two depths (0-5 and 5-15 cm) at
108 locations within a 10-ha research site encompassing different
cropping systems and landscape positions. Soil health measurements and
VNIR spectral data were obtained in the laboratory, while CI and ECa
data were obtained in situ. Calibration models were developed with
partial least squares (PLS) regression and model performance was
evaluated using coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square
error (RMSE). Models integrating ECa and CI with VNIR reflectance data
improved estimates of the overall SMAF score (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 7.21%)
relative to VNIR alone (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 8.41%), reducing RMSE by 14%.
Improved models were also achieved for estimates of the individual
chemical, biological, and physical soil health scores, demonstrating
reductions in RMSE of 2.8, 5.4, and 10.0%, respectively. The results of
this study illustrate the potential for rapid quantification of soil
health by fusing VNIR sensor data with auxiliary data obtained from
complementary sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Identifying and halting the decline of High Nature Value farmland (HNV)
is seen as essential to the EU meeting its 2020 biodiversity targets.
Data on HNV farmland is used to target policy instruments and monitor
changes in HNV to assess policy impact and development. Initial
estimates of HNV land were based on land cover data with limited spatial
resolution. The EU has since taken a distributed approach, allowing
countries to develop their own data and metrics to report on the
presence of HNV land, and changes to it. Land cover type has been the
main data used for reporting but no consistent set of data metrics have
been agreed. Therefore, there is interest in both developing
standardised reporting metrics and identifying land with high
restoration potential to increase the area of HNV land. We explore the
relationship between soil associations and broad habitats across a
member state (Wales) to determine if any discernible patterns exist
between soil and habitat diversity and if soils information might be
useful for identifying areas with high restoration potential. We
developed a set of criteria to identify soil abundance, combining soil
diversity with ecological rare species approaches. The rare (&amp;lt; 1000 ha)
and occasional (1000-10,000 ha) soils identified were associated with
significantly higher levels of habitat diversity than the national
average. We propose that soil diversity information could supplement
habitat information in identifying areas of potential restoration
interest. Two iconic areas of Wales, the Llyn Peninsula and Conwy
Valley, were compared for restoration potential. Soil diversity in both
areas is higher than the national average; habitat diversity was
average, or lower in the case of the Llyn Peninsula. These areas with
higher soil diversity offer greater potential for restoration to type-2
HNV. Soil diversity and habitat diversity were found to be positively
correlated at a national level despite major management modification of
habitats. Given this relationship it is proposed that soil diversity
information offers useful metrics alongside land cover data for
identifying or comparing areas with regard to potential restoration for
HNV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Culture-independent molecular surveys of plant root microbiomes indicate
that soil type generally has a stronger influence on microbial
communities than host phylogeny. However, these studies have mostly
focussed on model plants and crops. Here, we examine the root
microbiomes of multiple plant phyla including lycopods, ferns,
gymnosperms, and angiosperms across a soil chronosequence using 16S rRNA
gene amplicon profiling. We confirm that soil type is the primary
determinant of root-associated bacterial community composition, but also
observe a significant correlation with plant phylogeny. A total of 47
bacterial genera are associated with roots relative to bulk soil
microbial communities, including well-recognized plant-associated genera
such as Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, and Burkholderia, and major
uncharacterized lineages such as WPS-2, Ellin329, and FW68. We suggest
that these taxa collectively constitute an evolutionarily conserved core
root microbiome at this site. This lends support to the inference that a
core root microbiome has evolved with terrestrial plants over their 400
million year history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper demonstrates that geochemistry is useful for the
identification of sediment origin and provenance in alluvial plains
characterised by a complex hydrographic evolution. The study is focused
on the northeastern Padanian plain (Italy), an area primarily
characterised by sedimentary contributions from the two largest Italian
river systems (Po and Adige), which intimately interacted during the
last millennia. X-ray fluorescence analyses of 120 soils and alluvial
sediments define three diverse geochemical affinities that have
distinctive siderophile/chalcophile elemental ratios. The sample group
characterised by high Ni/Zn and Cr/Pb values conforms to modern Po River
sediments, whereas a second group showing low Ni/Zn and Cr/Pb values
conforms to the geochemical signature of modern Adige River sediments. A
third sample group defines a “transitional” affinity that represents a
geochemical mixture of Po (70%) and Adige (30%) sedimentary end-members.
Based on these geochemical features, it is possible to distinguish
alluvial sediments of the Po River basin (Ni/Zn &amp;gt; 1.0 and Cr/Pb &amp;gt; 4.2)
from those of the Adige River basin (Ni/Zn &amp;lt; 0.6 and Cr/Pb &amp;lt; 1.9) and to
provide evidence of the migration of these rivers during the evolution
of the Padanian plain. The interpretation of transitional samples is
less constrained and could imply an ancient connection between the two
fluvial systems, possibly due to the development of wetlands where both
the Po and Adige rivers variably delivered their sedimentary
contributions. This study approach, therefore, provides important
implications for palaeohydrographic and palaeoenvironmental
reconstructions in a complex area that is characterised by significant
geomorphological modifications during the last millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - agreed in 2015 by all 193
member states of the United Nations and complemented by commitments made
in the Paris Agreement - map out a broad spectrum of economic, social
and environmental objectives to be achieved by 2030. Reaching these
goals will require deep transformations in every country, as well as
major efforts in monitoring and measuring progress. Here we introduce
the SDG Index and Dashboards as analytical tools for assessing
countries’ baselines for the SDGs that can be applied by researchers in
the cross-disciplinary analyses required for implementation. The Index
and Dashboards synthesize available country- level data for all 17
goals, and for each country estimate the size of the gap towards
achieving the SDGs. They will be updated annually. All 149 countries for
which sufficient data is available face significant challenges in
achieving the goals, and many countries’ development strategies are
imbalanced across the economic, social and environmental priorities. We
illustrate the analytical value of the index by examining its
relationship with other widely used development indices and by showing
how it accounts for cross-national differences in subjective well-being.
Given significant data gaps, scope and coverage of the Index and
Dashboards are limited, but we suggest that these analyses represent a
starting point for a comprehensive assessment of national SDG baselines
and can help policymakers determine priorities for early action and
monitor progress. The tools also identify data gaps that must be closed
for SDG monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Characteristic length scales (CLS) define landscape structure and
delimit geomorphic processes. Here we use multiresolution analysis (MRA)
to estimate such scales from high-resolution topographic data. MRA
employs progressive terrain defocusing, via convolution of the terrain
data with Gaussian kernels of increasing standard deviation, and
calculation at each smoothing resolution of (i)the probability
distributions of curvature and topographic index (defined as the ratio
of slope to area in log scale) and (ii)characteristic spatial patterns
of divergent and convergent topography identified by analyzing the
curvature of the terrain. The MRA is first explored using synthetic 1-D
and 2-D signals whose CLS are known. It is then validated against a set
of MARSSIM (a landscape evolution model) steady state landscapes whose
CLS were tuned by varying hillslope diffusivity and simulated noise
amplitude. The known CLS match the scales at which the distributions of
topographic index and curvature show scaling breaks, indicating that the
MRA can identify CLS in landscapes based on the scaling behavior of
topographic attributes. Finally, the MRA is deployed to measure the CLS
of five natural landscapes using meter resolution digital terrain model
data. CLS are inferred from the scaling breaks of the topographic index
and curvature distributions and equated with (i)small-scale roughness
features and (ii)the hillslope length scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The world of viticulture connected to wine making has become a very
important activity in many inland areas permitting both the generation
of important income and the sustaining of agriculture systems.Recent
progress in both crop modeling and Decision Support Systems (DSS)
applied to viticulture promises important changes that combine both high
quality production and environmental sustainability. However, most of
this progress is only addressed at the farm level and does not challenge
the viticulture landscape, which is a key issue when facing DOC, DOCG
areas, wine growers’ cooperatives and consortiums and strategic
viticulture planning.Thus, this paper aims to demonstrate that a new
type of DSS, which is developed on a Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure
(GCI) platform, may provide an important web-based operational tool for
high quality viticulture as it connects farm and landscape levels
better.The GCI platform supports acquisition, management, processing of
both static and dynamic data (e.g. pedological, daily climatic, and
vineyard distribution), data visualization, and on-the-fly computer
applications in order to perform simulation modeling (e.g. grapevine
water stress, evaluation of ecosystem services, etc.). These are all
potentially accessible via the Web.This is possible thanks to the
implementation of a set of modeling clusters that is strongly rooted in
soil-plant-atmosphere and physically based simulation modeling.The DSS
tool, applied to an area of 20,000 ha in Southern Italy, is designed to
address viticulture planning and management by providing operational
support for farmers, farmer associations and decision makers involved in
the viticulture landscape.Output of the system includes viticulture
planning and management scenario analysis, maps and evaluation of
potential and current plant water stress.The tool will also be
demonstrated through a short selection of practical case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Structural changes in farming present serious challenges at all spatial
levels, from individual farms to the state level. The reorientation of a
farm (i.e., changing from livestock production to one of horticulture or
crops) represents one of these challenges. Here, a model assessing the
potential for reorganizing farms to focus on horticulture is presented.
The model accounts for various criteria, including: natural resources,
demographic, economic, and social factors. The selection, structure, and
importance of criteria and their interrelationships in the model are
based on statistical data about farms, data gathered through surveys,
and expert opinion groups. The model was developed using the Decision
Expert method, implemented by the software DEXi, and was validated using
a selection of farms. The added value of the approach is a transparent
assessment of a farm’s potential, which provides vital support for
deciding about its reorientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Phosphorus losses from land to water will be impacted by climate change
and land management for food production, with detrimental impacts on
aquatic ecosystems. Here we use a unique combination of methods to
evaluate the impact of projected climate change on future phosphorus
transfers, and to assess what scale of agricultural change would be
needed to mitigate these transfers. We combine novel high-frequency
phosphorus flux data from three representative catchments across the UK,
a new high-spatial resolution climate model, uncertainty estimates from
an ensemble of future climate simulations, two phosphorus transfer
models of contrasting complexity and a simplified representation of the
potential intensification of agriculture based on expert elicitation
from land managers. We show that the effect of climate change on average
winter phosphorus loads (predicted increase up to 30% by 2050s) will be
limited only by large-scale agricultural changes (e.g., 20-80% reduction
in phosphorus inputs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The “trapezoid” or “triangle” model constitutes the most popular
approach to remote sensing (RS) of surface soil moisture based on
coupled thermal (Le., land surface temperature) and optical RS
observations. The model, hereinafter referred to as Thermal-OptiCal
TRAapezoid Model (TOTRAM), is based on interpretation of the pixel
distribution within the land surface temperature - vegetation index
(LST-VI) space. TOTRAM suffers from two inherent limitations. It is not
applicable to satellites that do not provide thermal data (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and it requires parameterization for each individual
observation date. To overcome these restrictions we propose a novel
Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on the linear physical
relationship between soil moisture and shortwave infrared transformed
reflectance (SIR) and is parameterized based on the pixel distribution
within the SIR-VI space. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture
estimates derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations for the
Walnut Gulch and Little Washita watersheds were compared with ground
truth soil moisture data. Results indicate that the prediction
accuracies of OPTRAM and TOTRAM are comparable, with OPTRAM only
requiring observations in the optical electromagnetic frequency domain.
The volumetric moisture content estimation errors of both models were
below 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) with local calibration and about 0.04-0.05 cm(3)
cm(-3) without calibration. We also demonstrate that OPTRAM only
requires a single universal parameterization for a given location, which
is a significant advancement that opens a new avenue for remote sensing
of soil moisture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Wetlands are important providers of ecosystem services and key
regulators of climate change. They positively contribute to global
warming through their greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively through
the accumulation of organic material in histosols, particularly in
peatlands. Our understanding of wetlands’ services is currently
constrained by limited knowledge on their distribution, extent, volume,
interannual flood variability and disturbance levels. We present an
expert system approach to estimate wetland and peatland areas, depths
and volumes, which relies on three biophysical indices related to
wetland and peat formation: (1) long-term water supply exceeding
atmospheric water demand; (2) annually or seasonally water-logged soils;
and (3) a geomorphological position where water is supplied and
retained. Tropical and subtropical wetlands estimates reach 4.7 million
km(2) (Mkm(2)). In line with current understanding, the American
continent is the major contributor (45%), and Brazil, with its Amazonian
interfluvial region, contains the largest tropical wetland area (800,720
km(2)). Our model suggests, however, unprecedented extents and volumes
of peatland in the tropics (1.7 Mkm(2) and 7,268 (6,076-7,368) km(3)),
which more than threefold current estimates. Unlike current
understanding, our estimates suggest that South America and not Asia
contributes the most to tropical peatland area and volume (ca. 44% for
both) partly related to some yet unaccounted extended deep deposits but
mainly to extended but shallow peat in the Amazon Basin. Brazil leads
the peatland area and volume contribution. Asia hosts 38% of both
tropical peat area and volume with Indonesia as the main regional
contributor and still the holder of the deepest and most extended peat
areas in the tropics. Africa hosts more peat than previously reported
but climatic and topographic contexts leave it as the least peat-forming
continent. Our results suggest large biases in our current understanding
of the distribution, area and volumes of tropical peat and their
continental contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered cropland abandonment
on a continental scale, which in turn led to carbon accumulation on
abandoned land across Eurasia. Previous studies have estimated carbon
accumulation rates across Russia based on large-scale modelling. Studies
that assess carbon sequestration on abandoned land based on robust field
sampling are rare. We investigated soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks
using a randomized sampling design along a climatic gradient from forest
steppe to Sub-Taiga in Western Siberia (Tyumen Province). In total, SOC
contents were sampled on 470 plots across different soil and land-use
types. The effect of land use on changes in SOC stock was evaluated, and
carbon sequestration rates were calculated for different age stages of
abandoned cropland. While land-use type had an effect on carbon
accumulation in the topsoil (0-5 cm), no independent land-use effects
were found for deeper SOC stocks. Topsoil carbon stocks of grasslands
and forests were significantly higher than those of soils managed for
crops and under abandoned cropland. SOC increased significantly with
time since abandonment. The average carbon sequestration rate for soils
of abandoned cropland was 0.66 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (1-20 years old, 0-5
cm soil depth), which is at the lower end of published estimates for
Russia and Siberia. There was a tendency towards SOC saturation on
abandoned land as sequestration rates were much higher for recently
abandoned (1-10 years old, 1.04 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) compared to earlier
abandoned crop fields (11-20 years old, 0.26 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Our
study confirms the global significance of abandoned cropland in Russia
for carbon sequestration. Our findings also suggest that robust regional
surveys based on a large number of samples advance model-based
continent-wide SOC prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Two approaches have emerged as the preferred means for assessing
salinity at regional scale: (i) vegetative indices from satellite
imagery (e.g., MODIS enhanced vegetative index, NDVI) and (ii) analysis
of covariance (ANOCOVA) calibration of apparent soil electrical
conductivity (ECa) to salinity. The later approach is most recent and
least extensively validated. It is the objective of this study to
provide extensive validation of the ANOCOVA approach. The validation
comprised 77 fields in California’s Coachella Valley, ranging from 1.25
to 30.0 ha in size with an average size of 12.8 ha. Mobile
electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment surveyed the fields obtaining
geospatial measurements of ECa. Soil sample sites selected following
ECa-directed soil sampling protocols characterized the range and spatial
variation in ECa across the field. From the data, a regional ANOCOVA
model was developed. The regional ANOCOVA model successfully reduced
cross-validated, average log salinity prediction error (variance)
estimate by more than 30% across the 77 fields and improved the
depth-averaged prediction accuracy in 58 of the 77 fields. The results
show that the ANOCOVA modelling approach improves soil salinity
predictions from EMI signal data in most of the surveys conducted,
particularly fields where only a limited number of calibration sampling
locations were available. The establishment of ANOCOVA models at each
depth increment for a representative set of fields within a
regional-scale study area provides slope coefficients applicable to all
future fields within the region, significantly reducing ground-truth
soil samples at future fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil workability and friability are required parameters to consider when
creating suitable seedbeds for crop establishment and growth. Knowledge
of soil workability is important for scheduling tillage operations and
for reducing the risk of tillage-induced structural degradation of
soils. A reliable evaluation of soil workability implies a distinctive
definition of the critical water content (wet and dry limits) for
tillage. In this review, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the
methods for determining soil workability, and the effects of soil
properties and tillage systems on soil workability and fragmentation.
The strengths and limitations of the different methods for evaluating
the water content for soil workability, such as the plastic limit, soil
water retention curve (SWRC), standard Proctor compaction test, field
assessment, moisture-pressure-volume diagram, air permeability and
drop-shatter tests are discussed. Our review reveals that there is
limited information on the dry limit and the range of water content for
soil workability for different textured soils. We identify the need for
further research to evaluate soil workability on undisturbed soils using
a combination of SWRC and the drop-shatter tests or tensile strength;
(i) to quantify the effects of soil texture, organic matter and
compaction on soil workability; and (ii) to compare soil water content
for workability in the field with theoretical soil workability, thereby
improving the prediction of soil workability as part of a decision
support system for tillage operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The concept of soil health has been extensively reviewed in the
scientific literature, but there is only patchy and inconsistent
information available to farmers and growers who are concerned about the
declining condition of their soils and are looking for appropriate test
methods and management interventions to help reverse it. Although there
are well-established laboratory methods for soil chemical analysis, and
a range of laboratory and field methods for measuring soil physical
properties, only now are methods starting to emerge for soil biological
analysis. This study provides an overview of the methods that are
currently available commercially (or are close to commercialization) for
farmers and growers in the UK. We examine the science underpinning the
methods, the value of the information provided and how farmers and
advisors can use results from such assessments for informed
decision-making in relation to soil management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The increased recognition of the importance of soil is reflected in the
UN Post-2015 Development Agenda with sustainable development goals that
directly and indirectly relate to soil quality and protection. Despite a
lack of legally binding legislation for soil protection, the European
Commission remains committed to the objective of soil protection.
However, the achievement of a legally binding framework for soil
protection relies on the implementation of a soil monitoring network
(SMN) that can detect changes to soil quality over time. As
beneficiaries do not pay for the provision of soil information, the
options for soil monitoring are limited. The use of existing data sets
should be considered first. Using Ireland as an example, this research
explored the opportunities for a SMN for Ireland considering three
existing national data sets. The options for a SMN are considered in
terms of their spatial and stratified distribution, the parameters to be
measured and an economic analysis of the options proposed. This research
finds that for Ireland, either a 10 or a 16 km(2) grid interval
stratified by land use and drainage class offers the best potential in
relation to the spatial distribution of existing data sets to reflect
local data at a national level. With existing data, the stratified SIS
data using the 16 km(2) grid offers the best value for money, with
baseline costs for analysis, excluding field costs, of between (sic)706
481 and (sic)2.8 million. Acknowledging the impossibility of measuring
all parameters with ideal frequency, this study proposes a two-tier
system for optimized monitoring frequency. Parameters must anticipate
future policy requirements. Finally, the implementation of a SMN must be
accompanied by standardized methods, defined thresholds and action
mandates to maintain soil quality within allowable limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The prevailing discourse on the future of agriculture is dominated by an
imbalanced narrative that calls for food production to increase
dramatically-potentially doubling by 2050-without specifying
commensurate environmental goals. We aim to rebalance this narrative by
laying out quantitative and compelling midcentury targets for both
production and the environment. Our analysis shows that an increase of
approximately 25%-70% above current production levels may be sufficient
to meet 2050 crop demand. At the same time, nutrient losses and
greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture must drop dramatically to
restore and maintain ecosystem functioning. Specifying quantitative
targets will clarify the scope of the challenges that agriculture must
face in the coming decades, focus research and policy on achieving
specific outcomes, and ensure that sustainable intensification efforts
lead to measurable environmental improvements. We propose new directions
for research and policy to help meet both sustainability and production
goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
While SoilMoisture (SM) can be used as a direct indictor of dryness, the
Land Surface Temperature (LST) and vegetation status are indirectly
related to SM, and consequently, affect the degree of dryness. Each of
these three variables has been individually used to assess the dryness.
Furthermore, a combination of the LST and vegetation information has
also been applied for dryness estimation through the scatter-plot of the
LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, a
combination of these three variables has not been used to estimate the
dryness. In this study, a 3 Dimensional (3D) space of the LST,
Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), and SM was developed to define a
new dryness index named the Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture Dryness
Index (TVMDI). The TVMDI was evaluated against in situ SM and soil
temperature data, as well as the NDVI. The results demonstrated that the
TVMDI values were highly correlated with the field soil temperature data
and the NDVI (R = 0.78 and R = -0.87, respectively). However, even
though the dryness values estimated from the TVMDI were not highly
correlated with the in situ SM data, the correlation was still
acceptable (R = -0.65). Furthermore, a comparison between the proposed
index and several satellite-based dryness indices, including the
Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), Modified Perpendicular Drought Index
(MPDI), Second Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI1), and
Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), concluded that the TVMDI
was the most accurate index. Moreover, using the TVMDI and
multi-temporal Landsat 8 images two dryness maps were produced for the
Yanco area to show the effectiveness of the proposed index in depicting
the temporal and spatial variation of dryness values for medium spatial
resolution images. To show the effectiveness of the TVMDI in large scale
applications, two dryness maps from the all of Australia and Iran were
also produced using the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)
data. Overall, it was concluded that the TVMDI had a high potential to
map dryness over different regions, and is a promising index for early
awareness of drought risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The limited availability of soil information has been recognized as a
main limiting factor in digital soil mapping (DSM) studies. It is
therefore important to optimize the joint use of the three sources of
soil data that can be used as inputs of DSM models, namely spatial sets
of measured sites, soil maps and soil sensing products. In this paper,
we propose to combine these three inputs, through a cokriging with a
categorical external drift (CKCED). This new interpolation technique was
applied for mapping seven soil properties over a 24.6 km(2) area located
in the vineyard plain of Languedoc (Southern France), using an
hyperspectral imagery product as example of a soil sensing data.
Cross-validation results of CKCED were compared with those of five
spatial and non-spatial techniques using one of these inputs or a
combination of two of them. The results obtained in the La Peyne
Catchment showed i) the utility of soil map and hyperspectral imagery
products as auxiliary data for improving soil property predictions ii)
the greater added-value of the latter against the former in most
situations and iii) the feasibility and the interest of CKCED in a
limited number of soil properties and data configurations. Testing CKCED
in case study with soil maps of better quality and soil sensing
techniques covering more area and depths should be necessary to better
evaluate the benefits of this new technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper explores the importance of the N loss pathways relative to
the immobilisation and soil mineral N supply during a cotton season.
Despite using an agronomic practice of splitting urea application to
reduce losses and an optimal rate (232kg urea-N ha(-1)) for the
experiment, the average fertiliser recovery was 32%, which indicates
that soil N mineralisation is a key source of N for irrigated cotton
production systems. A large amount of the fertiliser (62kgNha(-1)) was
immobilised in the soil at the end of the season and during the season
the soil supplied 159kgNha(-1) to the plant via mineralisation. During
the season, large N losses occurred from the field via the atmospheric,
deep drainage and surface run-off pathways (143kgNha(-1)). The losses
occurred directly after fertilisation, predominantly at the start of the
season when the majority of the urea fertiliser was applied (180kg
urea-N ha(-1)). This indicates that the form, placement and timing of
the fertiliser did not synchronise with soil and crop N dynamics and
irrigation practice. Over the course of the measurement season, based on
the N inputs, losses and storage budget, a 42kgNha(-1) soil deficit was
observed. Further longer term work is required to quantify the magnitude
and significance of the soil N stock across different systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soils and sediments can be distinguished based on “composite
fingerprints”, i.e., sets of physical and chemical properties that are
suitable for discrimination. At present, statistical stepwise variable
selection methods are frequently applied to identify composite
fingerprints, although they have been seriously criticized. Here, we
test regularized logistic regression (RLR) as an alternative approach in
the context of a reservoir siltation study where the post-dam facies is
to be distinguished from the pre-dam facies.The pre- and post-dam facies
of four reservoirs located in the Kruger National Park were examined
with respect to grain size composition, color, and content of
calcium-lactate leachable phosphorus (P (CAL)). A composite fingerprint
was identified applying RLR to training data. The fitted regression
model was used for the classification of samples not involved in the
training dataset. For comparison, variable selection was performed with
stepwise discriminant function analysis (DFA) and samples were
classified by applying linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Both
approaches were validated by comparing field interpretation and
classification results. The analysis was extended based on Monte Carlo
simulations and synthetic datasets to quantify uncertainties and to
enhance the method comparison.RLR and stepwise DFA identify grain size
parameters and P (CAL) content to be particularly useful for the facies
discrimination. Neglecting and taking into account a potential sampling
bias, both approaches lead to &amp;lt;= 3 and 5% misclassifications,
respectively. RLR outperforms stepwise DFA/LDA in Monte Carlo
simulations, although misclassification rates do not significantly
differ (p = 0.84). RLR uses on average 12% less fingerprint properties.
Moreover, RLR-derived probabilities of group membership represent a more
reliable measure for classification conclusiveness than probabilities
calculated from LDA, which is evident in significantly lower (p &amp;lt; 0.001)
probability residuals for misclassified samples. Stepwise DFA/LDA
reveals lower misclassification rates than RLR when data fulfill
multivariate normality in each group and equal within-group covariance
matrices.RLR is an innovative tool for the discrimination of sediment
facies in reservoirs and, more generally, for studies requiring the
discrimination of soils and sediments. Although stepwise procedures will
in practice often perform similarly well, we discourage their use for
the identification of composite fingerprints due to the risk of
suboptimal variable selection involving variables with spurious
discriminatory power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We present a newly developed Multivariate Copula Analysis Toolbox
(MvCAT) which includes a wide range of copula families with different
levels of complexity. MvCAT employs a Bayesian framework with a
residual-based Gaussian likelihood function for inferring copula
parameters and estimating the underlying uncertainties. The contribution
of this paper is threefold: (a) providing a Bayesian framework to
approximate the predictive uncertainties of fitted copulas, (b)
introducing a hybrid-evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach
designed for numerical estimation of the posterior distribution of
copula parameters, and (c) enabling the community to explore a wide
range of copulas and evaluate them relative to the fitting
uncertainties. We show that the commonly used local optimization methods
for copula parameter estimation often get trapped in local minima. The
proposed method, however, addresses this limitation and improves
describing the dependence structure. MvCAT also enables evaluation of
uncertainties relative to the length of record, which is fundamental to
a wide range of applications such as multivariate frequency analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We evaluated the in situ performance of a newly designed visible and
near-infrared (Vis-NIR) penetrometer to predict clay content for 10
fields, 151 profile locations and 485 samples that span four orders of
the USDA Soil Taxonomy across the Pacific Northwest region of the USA.
The clay mineralogy of the soil families is mixed and heterogeneous. To
minimize the effects of soil moisture, in situ Vis-NIR measurements were
taken during the summer in a Mediterranean climate when most soil is at
or near wilting point. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and
leave-one-core-out cross-validation were used to assess the different
soil Vis-NIR measurements: (i) standard error of prediction (SEP) = 5.7,
residual product differential (RPD) = 1.69 for in situ, (ii) SEP = 5.3,
RPD = 1.83 for laboratory measurements of intact cores and (iii) SEP =
4.7, RPD = 2.0 for laboratory measurements of dried, sieved soil. The
two primary factors contributing to larger in situ errors of prediction
relative to laboratory-based measurements of dried, sieved soil were (i)
scanning an intact soil surface at field moisture compared with dried,
sieved-homogenized soil and (ii) problems with instrument drift and
referencing in the field. For four of the 10 fields with similar loess
soil and 24 cores per field, we found that for all soil preparations (in
situ, intact core and dried, sieved) field-specific calibrations (SEP =
5.1, RPD = 1.29 for in situ; SEP = 3.3, RPD = 2.0 for dried, sieved
samples) out-performed both a single calibration for the four fields and
a calibration that included all 10 fields in this study. More research
is required to understand better the effects of examining intact rather
than crushed-sieved soil material, a potentially important factor for in
situ spectroscopy. In situ predictions could probably be improved with a
more stable and internally referenced field spectrometer, but even with
these challenges the results show that penetrometer-derived in situ
spectroscopy can be used to map the variation in soil profile clay
content semi-quantitatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil moisture sensors are increasingly deployed in sensor networks for
both agronomic research and precision agriculture. Soil-specific
calibration improves the accuracy of soil water content sensors, but
laboratory calibration of individual sensors is not practical for
networks installed across heterogeneous settings. Using daily water
content readings collected from a sensor network (42 locations x 5
depths = 210 sensors) installed at the Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) near
Pullman, Washington, we developed an automated calibration approach that
can be applied to individual sensors after installation. As a first
step, we converted sensor-based estimates of apparent dielectric
permittivity to volumetric water content using three different
calibration equations (Topp equation, CAF laboratory calibration, and
the complex refractive index model, or CRIM). In a second,
“re-calibration” step, we used two pedotransfer functions based upon
particle size fractions and/or bulk density to estimate water content at
wilting point, field capacity, and saturation at each sensor insertion
point. Using an automated routine, we extracted the same three reference
points, when present, from each sensor’s record, and then bias corrected
and re-scaled the sensor data to match the estimated reference points.
Based on validation with field-collected cores, the Topp equation
provided the most accurate calibration with an RMSE of 0.074 m(3) m(-3),
but automated re-calibration with a local pedotransfer function
outperformed any of the calibrations alone, yielding a network-wide RMSE
of 0.055 m(3) m(-3). The initial calibration equation used in the first
step was irrelevant when the re-calibration was applied. After
correcting for the reference core measurement error of 0.026 m(3) m(-3)
used for calibration and validation, the error of the sensors alone
(RMSEadj) was computed as 0.049 m(3) m(-3). Sixty-five percent of
individual sensors exhibited re calibration errors less than or equal to
the network RMSEadj. The incorporation of soil physical information at
sensor installation sites, applied retroactively via an automated
routine to in situ soil water content sensors, substantially improved
network sensor accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper explores the use of a novel nonlinear parametric modelling
technique based on a Volterra Non-linear Regressive with eXogenous
inputs (VNRX) method to quantify the individual, interaction and overall
contributions of six soil properties on crop yield and normalised
difference vegetation index (NDVI). The proposed technique has been
applied on high sampling resolution data of soil total nitrogen (TN) in
%, total carbon (TC) in %, potassium (K) in cmol kg(-1), pH, phosphorous
(P) in mg kg-I and moisture content (MC) in %, collected with an on-line
visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy sensor from a 18 ha
field in Bedfordshire, UK over 2013 (wheat) and 2015 (spring barley)
cropping seasons. The online soil data were first subjected to a raster
analysis to produce a common 5 m by 5 m grid, before they were used as
inputs into the VNRX model, whereas crop yield and NDVI represented
system outputs. Results revealed that the largest contributions commonly
observed for both yield and NDVI were from K, P and TC. The highest sum
of the error reduction ratio (SERR) of 48.59% was calculated with the
VNRX model for NDVI, which was in line with the highest correlation
coefficient (r) of 0.71 found between measured and predicted NDVI.
However, on-line measured soil properties led to larger contributions to
early measured NDVI than to a late measurement in the growing season.
The performance of the VNRX model was better for NDVI than for yield,
which was attributed to the exclusion of the influence of crop diseases,
appearing at late growing stages. It was recommended to adopt the VNRX
method for quantifying the contribution of on-line collected soil
properties to crop NDVI and yield. However, it is important for future
work to include additional soil properties and to account for other
factors affecting crop growth and yield, to improve the performance of
the VNRX model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Agricultural production has become a key factor for the stability of the
world economy. The use of pesticides provides a more favorable
environment for the crops in agricultural production. However, the
uncontrolled and inappropriate use of pesticides affect the environment
by polluting preserved areas and damaging ecosystems. In the precision
agriculture literature, several authors have proposed solutions based on
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for
developing spraying processes that are safer and more precise than the
use of manned agricultural aircraft. However, the static configuration
usually adopted in these proposals makes them inefficient in
environments with changing weather conditions (e.g. sudden changes of
wind speed and direction). To overcome this deficiency, this paper
proposes a computer-based system that is able to autonomously adapt the
UAV control rules, while keeping precise pesticide deposition on the
target fields. Different versions of the proposal, with autonomously
route adaptation metaheuristics based on Genetic Algorithms, Particle
Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing and Hill-Climbing for optimizing
the intensity of route changes are evaluated in this study.
Additionally, this study evaluates the use of a ground control station
and an embedded hardware to run the route adaptation metaheuristics.
Experimental results show that the proposed computer-based system
approach with autonomous route change metaheuristics provides more
precise changes in the UAV’s flight route, with more accurate deposition
of the pesticide and less environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The physical environment of the intertidal zone presents a number of
challenges which make traditional surveying methods difficult to
implement; whilst the acquisition cost of airborne elevation data can be
prohibitive beyond localised applications. Remote sensing data from
earth observation satellites has been well established as a method for
mapping the extent and elevation profile of the intertidal zone; however
the majority of these applications are local in nature, and based on
analysis of a limited number of individual image observations.In this
paper we outline an automated methodology to model the intertidal extent
and topography of the Australian coastline, that leverages a full time
series of Landsat observations from 1987 to 2015 managed in the
Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC). Our approach reframes the
analysis from time of acquisition into the tidal domain through the use
of a continental scale tidal model, combined with a median pixel
compositing of Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) stacks, to
robustly estimate the tidal extent and elevation profile across the
observed tidal range. We demonstrate the ability of a median-based
compositing approach to deal effectively with data quality, modelling
outliers and other issues that commonly affect single scene
methodologies. Our new framework enables us to produce a
continental-scale intertidal model, detailing intertidal zone topography
at a 25 m spatial scale.We then demonstrate the potential of the
modelling framework to derive digital elevation data based on tidal
model attribution, validating our models against in-situ GPS
observations, before discussing issues that must be addressed to move
this capability to a continental scale. The ability of the model to
examine coastal stability is introduced, in the context of the
conceptual reframing of the data into the tidal domain, with a view to
furthering this application in future versions of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Rice-rice is one of the major cropping systems in Indo-Gangetic Plains
(IGP) of South Asia. Assessment of soil quality and identification of
key indicators with their critical limits are very much important for
maintaining normal functioning of the soil and productivity of crops,
particularly of wet land rice. The present investigation was undertaken
to identify sensitive soil quality indicators and to develop soil
quality indices and establishment of their critical limits in
Inceptisols, Entisols and Alfisols collected from farmers’ fields with
long-term rice-rice cropping system in sub-tropical India. The soil
samples were analysed for 37 physical, chemical and biological
properties. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to create
minimum data set (MDS) of physical, chemical and biological indicators
which were encompassed to develop unified soil quality index (SQI) under
different soil orders. The SQI thus developed was highest in Inceptisols
(0.66 to 0.89) followed by Entisols (0.23 to 0.76) and Alfisols (0.37 to
0.60). The upper and lower critical limits for key indicators as well as
SQI were determined using scattered plot technique involving relative
yields of rice (RY) and different soil quality indicators as well as SQI
The critical limit equivalent to 80% and 40% of relative yield were
treated as upper and lower critical limits of selected key indicators
and SQI. The adequacy classes for each of selected key indicator as a
function of relative yield of rice were established based on the
following criteria: &amp;lt;40% low, 40-80% moderate and &amp;gt;80% adequate. The
upper and lower critical limits of the indicators selected under
rice-rice cropping systems in Inceptisols were available Zn (1.7 and 1.2
mg kg(-1)), bulk density (1.2 and 1.6 Mg m(-3)),beta-glucosidase
activity (68 and 18 mu g p-nitrophenol g(-1) soil h(-1)) and urease
activity (64 and 24 pg NH4 g(-1) soil 2 h(-1)), in Entisols were
dehydrogenase activity (93 and 12 mu g TPF g(-1) soil 24 h(-1)),
aggregate stability (66 and 11%), total organic C (11.6 and 10.7 g
kg(-1)) and pHw (5.7 and 53) and in Alfisols were oxidisable organic C
(7.8 and 5.0 g kg(-1)),beta-glucosidase activity (51 and 15 mu g
p-nitrophenol g(-1) soil h(-1)), aggregate stability (52 and 19%) and
mineralizable C (273 and 173 mu g Cg(-1) soil), respectively. The upper
and lower critical limits established for key soil quality indicators as
well as soil quality indices for Inceptisols (0.85 and 0.56), Entisols
(0.23 and 0.65) and Alfisols (0.37 and 0.56) could periodically be
judged for maintaining/enhancing soil quality and yield sustainability
through the employment of optimum management practices in rice-rice
cropping systems of subtropical India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Evaluating the accuracy of allocation to classes in monothetic
hierarchical soil classification systems, including the World Reference
Base for Soil Classification, US Soil Taxonomy, and Chinese Soil
Taxonomy, is poorly-served by binomial methods correctlincorrect
allocation per evaluation observation), since some errors are more
serious than others in terms of soil properties, map use, pedogenesis,
and ease of mapping. Instead, evaluations should account for the
taxonomic distance between classes, expressed as class similarities,
giving partial credit to some incorrect allocations. These can then be
used in weighted accuracy measures, either direct measures of agreement
or measures that account for chance agreement, such as the tau index.
Similarities can be determined in one of four ways: (1) by the expert
opinion of a soil classification specialist; (2) by the distance between
classes in a numerical taxonomy assessment; (3) by distance within a
taxonomic hierarchy; or (4) by an error loss function. Expert opinion
can be from the point of view of the map user, to assess map utility, or
map producer, to assess mapping skill. Examples are given of determining
similarity between a subset of Chinese Soil Taxonomy classes by expert

these for weighted accuracy assessment. A method for assessing the
accuracy of probabilistic predictions of several classes at a location

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The development and implementation of a national data schema for soil
data in Australia over the last two decades, coupled with advances in
information technology, has led to the realisation of more comprehensive
state and national soil databases. This has facilitated increased access
to soil data for many purposes, including the creation of many digital
soil-mapping products, such as the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia.
Consequently, users of soil data have a growing need for clarity
concerning the quality of the data; many new users have little
understanding of the varying quality of the data. To date, statements
about the quality of primary soil data have typically been qualitative
and/or judgemental rather than explicit. The consequences of
poor-quality primary data and of the lack of a coding system for data
quality are growing with increased usage and with demand for soil data
at the regional to national scale. Pillar 4 of the Global Soil
Partnership and the National Soil Research, Development and Extension
Strategy both identify the need to improve the quality of soil data.
Various international standards do exist with respect to the quality of
soil data but these tend to focus on general principles and
quality-assurance frameworks rather than the detail of describing data
quality. The aim of this paper is to stimulate a discussion in the
Australian soil science community on how to quantify and describe the
quality of primary soil data. We provide examples of the data quality
issues and propose a framework for structured data-quality checking
procedures and quality coding of soil morphological and analytical data
in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Hyperspectral images provide rich spectral and spatially continuous
information that can be used for soil mineralogy discrimination. This
paper proposes a method to evaluate the feasibility of Hyperion image in
the rapid prediction of soil mineralogy. Four areas in Egypt were chosen
for the current study. Preprocessing of the Hyperion data was done
before applying the atmospheric correction. The minimum noise fraction
transformation was used to segregate noise in the data. Various
techniques were applied to the studied areas in which mixture tune
matched filtering gave good results in a prediction of the end-members.
Then, it employed to predict soil minerals in each cell using a spectral
unmixing method. Illite, chlorite, calcite, dolomite, kaolinite,
smectite, quartz, hematite, goethite, vermiculite, palygorskite and some
feldspar were identified. In addition, sand and limestone, calcite and
dolomite, and sand surface from similarly bright clouds can be
distinguished easily based on the proposed method. The soil minerals
obtained from X-ray diffraction analysis of the soil samples are in
conformity with spectrally dominant mineralogy from Hyperion data.
Different minerals can be identified using this method without any
knowledge of field spectra or any a priori field data, thus configuring
a “true” remote sensing method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Application of mechanical stresses to soil results in deformation,
micro-fracturing, particle motion, and liquid reconfiguration that may
release measurable amounts of stored elastic energy in the form of
acoustic emissions (AEs). This study aimed to systematically study AE
characteristics during confined uniaxial compression of soil samples and
link various AE parameters to soil deformation regimes. We hypothesized
that variations in AE characteristics could offer new insights into the
transition between elastic and plastic soil deformation and
noninvasively identify the onset of yield stress. We subjected soil
samples at known water contents to a loading-unloading-reloading cycle
under uniaxial compression using an oedometer coupled with an AE
monitoring system. The soil was a sandy loam equilibrated with two
initial gravimetric water contents (12 and 25%) and two initial bulk
densities (1.3 and 1.55 Mg m(-3)) for each water content. Observed AE
event numbers (hits) and their energy content (E) varied during stress
application to soil samples. Close agreement was found between soil
yield stress deduced from normalized cumulative AE parameters and
measured stress-void ratio curves (precompression stress, sigma(pc)) for
the dry soil; however, the yield stress deduced from AE parameters was
significantly larger than sigma(pc) for the wet soil. Swelling and
compression indices were strongly correlated to AE hits and E,
respectively. The preliminary results illustrate the potential of
monitoring passive AE during load application to characterize soil
mechanical parameters (potentially in situ). Nevertheless, additional
studies with controlled pore water pressure and a range of soil types
would be required to generalize these findings to offer a robust
AE-based method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In a previous study, vegetation linear extent and soil depth as
functions of time were proposed to follow percolation-based scaling laws
of power-law form. Although the power-law exponents are specified by
theory, the fundamental length, x(0), and time, t(0), scales must be
generated from physical arguments. In principle, these length and time
scales can vary widely with climate, soil, and plant variables. In the
previous study, approximate values, microns and seconds, were proposed
for x(0) and t(0), based on typical soil flow rates, x(0)/t(0), under
saturated conditions, and the concept of a single pore having a diameter
measured in microns. But the focus here is on development of predictive
relationships for soil depth and vegetation linear extent as functions
of time and, thus, on guidance for choosing specific values for x(0) and
t(0). In the present study, it is argued that the relevant flow rate for
soil formation is net (deep) infiltration, whereas for vegetation
extent, the relevant flux must equate to transpiration. In vegetation,
linear extent refers (approximately) equivalently to plant height, or
root radial extent. Here root radial extent is taken as half the
diameter of the projected root system. Since the root radial extent and
the root biomass are by definition related through the root fractal
dimensionality, the proposed relevance of transpiration to root radial
extent implies a specific relationship between transpiration and root
productivity, a measure of the root biomass added in a year. When
above-ground and below-ground biomass are closely related, one can infer
a proportionality of net primary productivity to root biomass changes.
The general concepts are tested on large data-bases for the temporal
evolution of plant heights and soil depths, as well as the productivity
as a function of evapotranspiration and soil calcic and gypsic horizon
depths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Permafrost soils store large amounts of carbon. Warming can result in
carbon release from thawing permafrost, but it can also lead to enhanced
primary production, which can increase soil carbon stocks. The balance
of these fluxes determines the nature of the permafrost feedback to
warming. Here we assessed decadal changes in soil organic carbon stocks
in the active layer-the uppermost 30 cm-of permafrost soils across
Tibetan alpine regions, based on repeated soil carbon measurements in
the early 2000s and 2010s at the same sites. We observed an overall
accumulation of soil organic carbon irrespective of vegetation type,
with a mean rate of 28.0 g Cm-2 yr(-1) across Tibetan permafrost
regions. This soil organic carbon accrual occurred only in the
subsurface soil, between depths of 10 and 30 cm, mainly induced by an
increase of soil organic carbon concentrations. We conclude that the
upper active layer of Tibetan alpine permafrost currently represents a
substantial regional soil carbon sink in a warming climate, implying
that carbon losses of deeper and older permafrost carbon might be offset
by increases in upper-active-layer soil organic carbon stocks, which
probably results from enhanced vegetation growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Estimates of cation exchange capacity (CEC) for soil or earth materials
are vital for several applications in agriculture and geotechnical
engineering. The time-consuming and laborious nature of standard methods
of CEC determination prompted the development of regression-based
techniques and more sophisticated methodologies, such as artificial
neural networks (ANNs), to estimate CEC from other soil properties (e.g.
clay, organic matter and pH). The present study proposes regression
relations for estimating CEC from soil water content at different
relative humidity (RH) values that range from 10 to 90% and considering
sorption hysteresis. For model development, water adsorption and
desorption isotherms were measured for 203 soil samples from different
parts of the world with a vapour sorption analyser within an RH range
from 3 to 93%. Regression models were developed for both adsorption and
desorption for nine RH values (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%).
For 35 independent soil samples, the models predicted CEC accurately
(root mean squared error (RMSE): adsorption= 2.47 (0.04) cmol(+) kg(-1);
desorption=2.52 (0.09) cmol(+) kg(-1)) with no clear effect of RH value
or sorption direction on the accuracy of prediction. The new models were
superior to three models from the literature based on clay, organic
matter and pH; the smallest RMSE from these models was 4.13 cmol(+)
kg(-1) for the same 35 soil samples. Furthermore, the water
sorption-based models performed better than literature models based on
data mining tools (ANNs, support vector machines) and visible near
infrared spectroscopy when standardized RMSE values were compared. Thus,
a simple measure of soil water content at a known RH can serve as an
accurate substitute for measuring soil CEC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
With over two decades of historical observations, DMSP/OLS nighttime
lights (NTL) are an invaluable asset for monitoring, characterizing, and
understanding human activity. Due to the lack of on-board calibration,
there are systematic biases in NTL data. Consequently, a key deterrent
to the use of the entire NTL archive is the difficulty in generating a
consistent NTL time series. Currently, there are a number of methods to
calibrate Nu. data in order to generate a consistent time series.
However, there is no systematic evaluation of the performances of these
calibration efforts. The purpose of this paper is to compare and
evaluate existing calibration methods and to provide guidance to NTL end
users on their relative strengths and weaknesses. We apply two widely
adopted criteria to assess the performance of the methods: a) systematic
bias minimization, and b) relation with ancillary socio-economic data on
economic activity and electricity consumption. Our results show that
global-scale calibration methods outperform regionally-based calibration
methods. Furthermore, inconsistencies, in the form of differences in
pixel values from two satellites of the same region and year, continue
to exist in NTL data even after the calibration methods are applied,
both across regions and across scales. We find that dimly lit regions
are more difficult to calibrate compared to brightly lit regions and
that inconsistencies persist in higher northern and lower southern
latitudes. We conclude that significant improvements in calibration
results will require a shift either towards absolute correction methods
using in-situ data or relative calibration methods using NTL from VIIRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Bare ground gain, or vegetative cover loss, is an important component of
global land cover change resulting from economic drivers such as
urbanization and resource extraction. In this study, we characterized
global bare ground gain from Landsat time series. The maps were then
used to stratify the globe in creating a sample-based estimate of global
bare ground gain extent, land cover/land use outcomes, and associated
uncertainties from 2000 to 2012. An estimated total of 93,896 km(2) (+/-
9317 km(2) for 95% confidence interval) of bare ground gain occurred
over the study period. Human-induced bare ground gain accounted for 95%
of the total and consisted of the following components: 39% commercial
and residential development, 23% resource extraction, 21% infrastructure
development, 11% transitional, and 1% greenhouses. East Asia and the
Pacific accounted for nearly half of all global bare ground gain area
(45%), with China alone accounting for 35% of global gain. The United
States was second to China, accounting for 17% of total bare ground
gain. Land cover/land use outcomes of bare ground gain varied between
regions and countries, reflecting different stages of development and
the possible use of bare ground gain as an indicator of economic
activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter in environmental
studies and resource management. The MODIS LST data product has been
widely used in various studies, such as drought monitoring,
evapotranspiration mapping, soil moisture estimation and forest fire
detection. However, cloud contamination affects thermal band
observations and will lead to inconsistent LST results. In this study,
we present a new Remotely Sensed DAily land Surface Temperature
reconstruction (RSDAST) model that recovers clear sky LST for pixels
covered by cloud using only clear-sky neighboring pixels from nearby
dates. The reconstructed LST was validated using the original LST
pixels. Model shows high accuracy for reconstructing one masked pixel
with R-2 of 0.995, bias of -0.02 K and RMSE of 0.51 K. Extended spatial
reconstruction results show a better accuracy for flat areas with R-2 of
0.72-0.89, bias of -0.02-0.21 K, and RMSE of 0.92-1.16 K, and for
mountain areas with R-2 of 0.81-0.89, bias of 0.35-1.52 K, and RMSE of
1.42-2.24 K. The reconstructed areas show spatial and temporal patterns
that are consistent with the clear neighbor areas. In the reconstructed
LST and NDVI triangle feature space which is controlled by soil
moisture, LST values distributed reasonably and correspond well to the
real soil moisture conditions. Our approach shows great potential for
reconstructing clear sky LST. under cloudy conditions and provides
consistent daily LST which are critical for daily drought monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Singularity analysis is one of the most important models in the
fractal/multifractal family that has been demonstrated as an efficient
tool for identifying hybrid distribution patterns of geochemical data,
such as normal and multifractal distributions. However, the question of
how to appropriately separate these patterns using reasonable thresholds
has not been well answered. In the present study, a new method termed
singularity-quantile (S-Q) analysis was proposed to separate multiple
geochemical anomaly populations based on integrating singularity
analysis and quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot) analysis. The new method
provides excellent abilities for characterizing frequency distribution
patterns of singularity indices by plotting singularity index quantiles
vs. standard normal quantiles. From a perspective of geochemical element
enrichment processes, distribution patterns of singularity indices can
be evidently separated into three groups by means of the new method,
corresponding to element enrichment, element generality and element
depletion, respectively. A case study for chromitite exploration based
on geochemical data in the western Junggar region (China), was employed
to examine the potential application of the new method. The results
revealed that the proposed method was very sensitive to the changes of
singularity indices with three segments when it was applied to
characterize geochemical element enrichment processes. And hence, the
S-Q method can be considered as an efficient and powerful tool for
separating hybrid geochemical anomalies on the basis of statistical and
inherent fractal/multifractal properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Parameters of biological activity (humus and microbial biomass reserves,
potential intensity of the CO2 emission, and enzyme activity) have been
determined in arable and natural chernozems on the plains of
Kabardino-Balkaria as a part of the system for the ecological assessment
of the state of the soil cover. Integral parameters of the
eco-biological state of studied soils have been calculated on the basis
of obtained data, and the level of changes in their total biological
activity has been determined. A statistically significant decrease of
the values of all the considered biological properties under the impact
of tillage has been found. The data of two-way ANOVA suggest a stronger
influence of agricultural management in comparison with genetic features
of chernozems at the level of subtype. Differential approach is
insufficient for evaluating the total level of soil biological activity,
because there are many biological properties of soil, and the degrees of
their changes in agrogenic soils are different. An integral approach has
been used; it integrates the obtained data into a single integral
assessment parameter. In arable soils, this integral parameter decreases
by 39-46% and makes it possible to assess the degree of disturbance of
the ecological functions of soils and their capacity for
self-restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We studied an improved slope form system using a fuzzy logic method to
assess and map soil fertility of a mountain region in northern Vietnam
that has strong relief conditions. The lack of good soil mapping
techniques in Vietnam has brought about insufficient soil information,
which often leads to false recommendations for land use and crop
planning. The reviewed literature describes soil-mapping techniques
using fuzzy logic method, but all of them are applied for mapping areas
that have gentle relief conditions that are unlikely to be applicable to
the mountainous soils in our study area. In this paper, we introduce a
detailed slope form system that significantly describes the complexity
of terrain characteristics of the area to be mapped, and provides more
detail about the variability of the soil fertility of the area. Nine
basic slopeforms were used to characterize for each of upper-, middle-,
and foot slope positions, making the list 27 slopeforms. Together with
crest and valley, the total unit number is 29. We investigated soils of
the area and classified them into the major soil groups and calculated
soil property indices for all of them. We identified four major
environmental parameters affecting soil formation and soil quality:
geology, elevation, slope inclination and land use. The findings
indicated that soil fertility differs at slope positions. Soils located
at upper slope positions, where agricultural activity only started
recently, are more fertile than those found at middle slope positions.
Soils located at foot slope positions, where eroded sediments
accumulate, also have high levels of fertility compared to those on the
middle slope. The improved slope form system then became an important
additional environmental parameter for this soil mapping work. At a same
comparable category, i.e. slope position, geology, soil group,
elevation, slope gradient, straight slopeforms are an indicator for
better soil fertility compared to convex and concave forms. Although the
findings could not specify soil fertility variability for all 29
slopeforms, they did emphasize the major differences in soil fertility
and soil formation based on three major forms of convex, straight and
concave, with other factors taken into account, such as slope
inclination, geology and elevation. We expect our results to be used by
scientists and local authorities in deriving more effective land use and
crop options for land use management strategies for the northern
Vietnam’s mountain regions.&lt;/p&gt;

Mineral targets are local geological anomalies. In a study area of a
number of unit cells, mapping mineral prospectivity can be implemented
by identifying anomaly cells from the unit cell population. One-class
support vector machine (OCSVM) models can yield useful results in
anomaly detection in high-dimensional data or without any assumptions on
the distribution of the inlying data. The OCSVM model was applied to
mapping gold prospectivity of the Laotudingzi-Xiaosiping district, an
area with a complex geological background, in Jilin Province, China. The
decision function value of each unit cell belonging to an anomaly was
computed on the basis of the trained OCSVM model and used to express
gold prospectivity of the cell. The receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve, area under curve (AUC) and data-processing efficiency were
used to compare the performance of the OCSVM model and a restricted
Boltzmann machine (RBM) model in mapping gold prospectivity. The results
show that the OCSVM model outperforms the RBM model in terms of ROC, AUC
and data-processing efficiency. Gold targets were optimally delineated
by using the Youden index to maximise the spatial association between
the delineated gold targets and known gold deposits. The gold targets
delineated by the OCSVM model occupy 11% of the study area and contain
88% of the known gold deposits; and the gold targets delineated by the
RBM model occupy 10% of the study area and contain 81% of the known gold
deposits. Therefore, the OCSVM model is a feasible mineral prospectivity
mapping approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Drought is one of the most important climate change factors, but its
effects on ecosystems are little understood. While known to influence
soil carbon (C) cycling, it remains unresolved if altered rainfall
patterns induced by climate change will stimulate positive feedbacks of
CO2 into the atmosphere. Using a meta-analysis frame-work including 1495
observations from 60 studies encompassing a variety of ecosystems and
soil types, we investigated drought effects on respiration rates,
cumulative respiration during drying-rewetting cycles, metabolic
quotient (qCO(2)), dissolved organic C (DOC), microbial biomass and
fungi to bacteria (F:B) ratios from laboratory and field experiments. We
show that C-rich soils (&amp;gt;2% organic carbon) increase CO2 release into
the atmosphere after intense droughts, but that C-poor soils show a net
decline in C losses. We explain this self-reinforcing mechanism of
climate change in C-rich soils by: (i) high substrate availability that
magnify bursts of CO2 release after drought events and (ii) a shift in
microbial community with increased loss of C per unit of biomass. These
findings shed light on important responses of soil CO2 emissions to
drought, which could either offset or facilitate positive feedbacks to
global warming. Our results should be considered in global climate
models, as even small changes in soil CO2 emission have large
repercussions for global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
A theory called the Regulatory Gate Hypothesis was previously proposed
to considers that the rate limiting step in soil organic carbon (SOC)
mineralization is independent of the size, community stricture or
specific activity (mg CO2-C evolved g(-1) biomass C) of the soil
microbial biomass. Here we report new experiments to test this
hypothesis. In the first experiment, six different soils were perfused
with CHCI3-saturated water to model SOC release and to stop microbial
activity. Apart from one highly organic soil, they all released SOC at
low and roughly constant rates, over sixty three days. In the second
experiment, when the freeze-dried perfusates were returned to the parent
soils, their % mineralization ranged from 17 to 35% over ten days, in
contrast to bulk SOC (range 0.46-0.77%). In the third experiment, two
soils were given three consecutive fumigations, each followed by 10 days
aerobic incubation. The microbial biomass was decreased by &amp;gt; 90%, yet
SOC mineralization proceeded at the same rate as in nonfumigated soil.
In the fourth experiment, the six soils were subjected to various
perturbations, including non perturbed controls, fumigation-incubation,
air-drying rewetting, freeze-thaw (-20 degrees C and 80 degrees C) and
sieving &amp;lt; 0.3 mm. After an initial flush due to the perturbations, the
rates of mineralization became roughly equal in nearly all soil
treatments and comparable to the control, despite significant declines
in biomass. This shows that basal respiration was little affected by the
perturbations. In Experiment five the effects of the perturbations on
the microbial communities in the different soils and perturbations were
determined. The bacterial community was significantly modified by both
fumigation and air drying-rewetting, due mainly to increased
Firmiculites and decreased Proteobacteria populations. Our findings
suggest that mineralization of SOC is a two-stage process: firstly,
non-bioavailable forms are converted abiologically to bioavailable forms
(termed the Regulatory Gate), which, only then, undergo second process,
biological mineralization. This finding has serious implications for
theories of e.g. SOC dynamics, effects of global warming and soil
nutrient cycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Labile soil carbon is an important component of soil organic matter
because it embodies the mineralizable material that is associated with
short-term fertility. Permanganate-oxidizable C (POXC) is a widely used
method for the study of labile C dynamics in soils. Rapid methods are
needed to measure labile C, and better understand how this pool varies
with soil C at regional scales. Infrared spectroscopy is an inexpensive
way to quantify SOC and observe fluctuations in C functional groups.
Using a sample set that encompassed several soil types and plant
communities (seven different research projects, n = 496), soils were
analyzed via diffuse reflectance Fourier transformed mid-infrared
(MidIR, 4000-400 cm(-1)) and near-infrared (NIR, 10000-4000 cm(-1))
spectroscopy. Spectral data were used to develop calibrations for POXC,
soil organic C (SOC), and total N (TN) using partial least squares (PLS)
regression. The MidIR predicted POXC slightly better than the NIR, with
calibration and/or validation R-2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81
depending on spectral pretreatments. Predictions for POXC were better
than SOC and TN, but site variability influenced the calibration quality
for SOC and TN. Using a selected MidIR region, which included bands
correlated to POXC (3225-2270 cm(-1)), reduced the calibration quality,
but still gave acceptable R-2 values of 0.76 to 0.77 for the calibration
and validation sets. We show that POXC can be predicted using NIR and
MidIR spectra. Selecting informative spectral bands offers an
alternative to using full spectra for PLS regressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Partial dependence plots generated by Random Forest (RF) imply an
association between soil and environmental variables. This study
develops a method to construct membership functions representing
knowledge of soil-environment relationships from partial dependence. Key
parameters were obtained from normalized partial dependence to define
class limits and membership gradation. Seven environmental variables
were selected on the basis of the variable’s importance within RF. Two
cases were conducted to test the effectiveness of our method using
different training samples. Case 1 used 33 representative locations as
training samples and 50 locations as validations. Case 2 randomly split
all 83 samples into training and validation subsets at a proportion of
2: 1; the splits were repeated seven times. For each case, the generated
membership functions were used for mapping soil subgroups in Heshan,
China, under the Soil Landscape Inference Model framework; RF was
conducted for comparison. The results showed that mapping accuracy based
on the membership functions (78%) was much higher than that of RF only
(60%) in Case 1. In Case 2, the mapping accuracies using membership
functions (an average of 67%, SD = 6.5%) were not always higher than
those by RF (an average of 67%, SD = 8.0%). The constructed membership
functions were impacted by the training samples. Use of representative
training samples is recommended when applying the proposed method.
However, training samples (including representative samples and other
samples) with good coverage in the environmental feature space would
allow RF to obtain more accurate soil maps than using representative
samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil class mapping relies on the ability of sample locations to
represent portions of the landscape with similar soil types; however,
most digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches intersect sample locations
with one raster pixel per covariate layer regardless of pixel size. This
approach does not take the variability of covariate information adjacent
to the training data into account. The objective here was to
disaggregate a soil map in a semiarid Arizona rangeland (78,569 ha) by
exploring different neighborhood sizes for extracting covariate data to
points. Eight machine learning algorithms were compared to assess the
influence of summarizing covariate data in 0-, 15-, 30-, 60-, 90-, 120-,
150-, and 180-m circular neighborhoods and a multiscale model. K values
of all models ranged between 0.24 and 0.44 and increased with
neighborhood size up to 150 m. Support vector machine and random forest
algorithms performed best across all scales. The radial support vector
machine model using a 150-m neighborhood had the highest K and produced
a more generalized map compared with the best multiscale model (random
forest), which resulted in a mix of general and detailed soil features.
Evaluating a range of neighborhood sizes for aggregating covariate data
provides a method of accounting for multiscale processes that are
important for predicting soil patterns without modifying the pixel size
of the final maps. Incorporating concepts from traditional soil surveys
with DSM approaches can strengthen ties between them and optimize the
extraction of landscape information for predicting soil properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Gross primary production (GPP) is a first-order uncertainty in climate
predictions. Large-scale CO2 observations can provide information about
the carbon cycle, but are not directly useful for GPP. Recently carbonyl
sulfide (COS or OCS) has been proposed as a potential tracer for
regional and global GPP. Here we present the first regional assessment
of GPP using COS. We focus on the North American growing season-a global
hotspot for COS air-monitoring and GPP uncertainty. Regional variability
in simulated vertical COS concentration gradients was driven by
variation in GPP rather than other modelled COS sources and sinks.
Consequently we are able to show that growing season GPP in the Midwest
USA significantly exceeds that of any other region of North America.
These results are inconsistent with some ecosystem models, but are
supportive of new ecosystem models from CMIP6. This approach provides
valuable insight into the accuracy of various ecosystem land models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The scale and magnitude of complex and pressing environmental issues
lend urgency to the need for integrative and reproducible analysis and
synthesis, facilitated by data-intensive research approaches. However,
the recent pace of technological change has been such that appropriate
skills to accomplish data-intensive research are lacking among
environmental scientists, who more than ever need greater access to
training and mentorship in computational skills. Here, we provide a
roadmap for raising data competencies of current and next-generation
environmental researchers by describing the concepts and skills needed
for effectively engaging with the heterogeneous, distributed, and
rapidly growing volumes of available data. We articulate five key
skills: (1) data management and processing, (2) analysis, (3) software
skills for science, (4) visualization, and (5) communication methods for
collaboration and dissemination. We provide an overview of the current
suite of training initiatives available to environmental scientists and
models for closing the skill-transfer gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil varies from location to location as a result of complex
combinations of soil forming factors and processes operating at
different scales and intensities. The scale-dependent variability in
soil properties causes challenges for the characterization and mapping
of soils. With the advent of technologies, proximal sensors such as
gamma radiometrics can characterize soil spatial variability and the
digital mapping of soil properties. In this study we aim to characterize
scale-dependent variability of proximal gamma radiometrics and its
complex relationship with soil properties at different scales using
wavelet transform and wavelet coherency. We measured gamma radio metrics
(gamma-ray potassium (K-40), uranium (U-238), thorium (Th-232) and Total
Count (gamma-TC)) using a hand-held device in the field every 25 m along
a 3.0 km transect. At each point we measured elevation (m) and land use
and collected soil samples to determine key soil properties (electrical
conductivity EC1:5, pH (CaCl2), soil organic carbon (SOC), cation
exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable potassium (exch. K), and Colwell
P). Wavelet spectra identified significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) variations at
different scales and locations for both gamma-ray and soil properties.
There were significant localized variations with changes in elevation
and land use also important. In most cases a ‘global’ Pearson
correlation between the gamma-ray and soil properties was not
significant. In contrast, wavelet coherency provided a more powerful
scale-and location-specific relationship between gamma-ray, elevation
and land use with selected soil properties. For example, a strong
correlation (18% of the area was significant) was detected between land
use and soil EC1:5 at all scales (&amp;lt;100-800 m) in a low drainage
depression. This correlation was due to the localized mobilization of
salts and has implications for the identification of saline land. At
large spatial scales (&amp;gt;800 m) there was significant positive
correlations between gamma-TC and SOC (36% by area). At medium scales
(similar to 400 m) there was significant and positive correlations
between K-40 and CEC (23% by area), but only along the first half of the
transect which was underlain with Bushy Creek Granodiorite. These
findings provide an improved understanding of the spatial variability of
gamma-ray-soil relationships. The approach used shows the scope and
significant potential to use wavelet analysis of gamma-soil property
relationships that are scale-specific and would be useful for digital
soil mapping. Moreover, scale-specific spatial information of soil
properties aids understanding of soil formation processes and it
illustrates an approach to improve future soil sampling strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In this study, a regional revision coefficient is proposed for the
Equivalent Value Factors to better valuate the Sanjiang Plain (in China)
ecosystem services. An index system suitable for the valuation of the
ecosystem services in the Sanjiang Plain is established. The proposed
method can realize the rapid valuation of nine ecosystem service types
of six different terrestrial ecosystems. Through the preliminary
application of the method, the calculated total value of ecosystem
services of the Sanjiang Plain in 2010 was 510.89 billion yuan, of which
the forest ecosystem contributed to 37.85%, followed by water bodies and
wetland ecosystems. The variations among the contributions of the
different ecosystem services are considerable. The contribution
attributed to regulation function was the highest, especially the value
from the hydrological regulation (36.17%) and climate regulation
(16.04%). The Total Economic Value (TEV) method and the Equivalent Value
Factors (EVF) method are compared in this study. Results show that
Equivalent Value Factors derived value of the Sanjiang Plain ecosystem
services is slightly lower than the value obtained by the Total Economic
Value method, i.e., 537.84 billion yuan, of which the total value of the
Feature Services has reached as high as 38.35 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The costs of conserving land for species generally vary in space and
time. In addition, they are not exogenous to the land-use dynamics but
develop endogenously. This gives rise to feedback loops because the
costs determine the land use dynamics which in turn determine the costs.
This cost feedback is likely to affect the effectiveness of biodiversity
conservation instruments that target land use in a spatially explicit
manner. In the present paper a model of a tradable permit market with
agglomeration bonus is extended for the consideration of cost feedbacks
such that the presence of conserved land in the neighborhood may
increase or decrease the local cost. The model analysis demonstrates
that the in the former case the level of spatial clustering of conserved
land is reduced while in the latter case it is increased. Clustering of
conserved land is important for many species and thus cost feedbacks
will eventually affect the survival of species and need to be considered
in the design of conservation instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The fate of the terrestrial biosphere is highly uncertain given recent
and projected changes in climate. This is especially acute for impacts
associated with changes in drought frequency and intensity on the
distribution and timing of water availability. The development of
effective adaptation strategies for these emerging threats to food and
water security are compromised by limitations in our understanding of
how natural and managed ecosystems are responding to changing
hydrological and climatological regimes. This information gap is
exacerbated by insufficient monitoring capabilities from local to global
scales. Here, we describe how evapotranspiration (ET) represents the key
variable in linking ecosystem functioning, carbon and climate feedbacks,
agricultural management, and water resources, and highlight both the
outstanding science and applications questions and the actions,
especially from a space-based perspective, necessary to advance them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Classification is a fundamental process in remote sensing used to relate
pixel values to land cover classes present on the surface. Over large
areas land cover classification is challenging particularly due to the
cost and difficulty of collecting representative training data that
enable classifiers to be consistent and locally reliable. A novel
methodology to classify large volume Landsat data using high quality
training data derived from the 500 m MODIS land cover product is
demonstrated and used to generate a 30 m land cover classification for
all of North America between 20 degrees N and 50 degrees N. Publically
available 30 m global monthly Web-enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) products
generated from every available Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 5 TM image for
a three year period, that are defined aligned to the MODIS land products
and are consistently pre-processed data (cloud-screened, saturation
flagged, atmospherically corrected and normalized to nadir BRDF adjusted
reflectance), were classified. The MODIS 500 m land cover product was
filtered judiciously, using only good quality pixels that did not change
land cover class in 2009, 2010 or 2011, followed by automated selection
of spatially corresponding 30 m GWELD temporal metric values, to define
a large training data set sampled across North America. The training
data were sampled so that the class proportions were the same as the
North America MODIS land cover product class proportions and
corresponded to 1% of the 500 m and &amp;lt;0.005% of the 30 m pixels. Thirty
nine GWELD temporal metrics for every 30 m North America pixel location
were classified using (a) a single random forest, and (b) a locally
adaptive method with a random forest classifier derived and applied
locally and the classification results spatially mosaicked together. The
land cover classification results appeared geographically plausible and
at synoptic scale were similar to the MODIS land cover product. Detailed
visual inspection revealed that the locally adaptive random forest
classifications and associated classification confidences were generally
more coherent than the single random forest classification results. The
level of agreement between the 30 m classifications and the MODIS land
cover product derived training data was assessed by bootstrapping the
random forest implementation. The locally adaptive random forest
classification had higher overall agreement (95.44%, 0.9443 kappa) than
the single random forest classification (93.13%, 0.9195 kappa). The
paper concludes with a discussion of future research including the
potential for automated global land cover classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In this study, the added utility of nonlinear rescaling methods relative
to linear methods in the framework of creating a homogenous soil
moisture time series has been explored. The performances of 31 linear
and nonlinear rescaling methods are evaluated by rescaling the Land
Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture datasets to
station-basedwatershed average datasets obtained over four United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
watersheds. The linear methods include first-order linear regression,
multiple linear regression, and multivariate adaptive regression splines
(MARS), whereas the nonlinear methods include cumulative distribution
function matching (CDF), artificial neural networks (ANN), support
vector machines (SVM), Genetic Programming (GEN), and copula methods.
MARS, GEN, SVM, ANN, and the copula methods are also implemented to
utilize lagged observations to rescale the datasets. The results of a
total of 31 different methods show that the nonlinear methods improve
the correlation and error statistics of the rescaled product compared to
the linear methods. In general, the method that yielded the best results
using training data improved the validation correlations, on average, by
0.063, whereas ELMAN ANN and GEN, using lagged observations methods,
yielded correlation improvements of 0.052 and 0.048, respectively. The
lagged observations improved the correlations when they were
incorporated into rescaling equations in linear and nonlinear fashions,
with the nonlinear methods (particularly SVM and GEN but not ANN and
copula) benefitting from these lagged observations more than the linear
methods. The overall results show that a large majority of the
similarities between the LPRM and watershed average datasets are due to
linear relations; however, nonlinear relations clearly exist, and the
use of nonlinear rescaling methods clearly improves the accuracy of the
rescaled product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In remote sensing data exploitation, spectral mixture analysis is
commonly used to detect land cover materials and their corresponding
proportions present in the observed scene. In recent years, high spatial
resolution airborne hyperspectral images have shown their potential for
deriving accurate land cover maps. In this paper, a new spectral mixture
analysis model for mapping urban environments using high spatial
resolution airborne hyperspectral data is proposed. First, non-local
self-similarity is exploited to partition the scene into groups of
similar pixels. The spectral signals of the pixels in each of these
groups are assumed to be comprised of the same endmembers, but with
different abundance values. Then, the similar pixels in each group are
simultaneously unmixed using a jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis
method. The proposed method was applied to map land cover in Pavia city,
northern Italy, using airborne ROSIS data. An overall classification
accuracy of 97.24% was achieved for the Vegetation - Impervious surface
- Soil model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis model is well suited for
mapping land cover in urban environments using high resolution
hyperspectral data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Most soil structure-related physical properties are correlated to soil
organic carbon (SOC) content. Texture, mineralogy, and SOC:clay ratio
are also acknowledged to affect physical properties, however there is no
consensus or general conclusions in this respect. Against this
background, the present study aims at determining objectives for the
management of SOC in terms of structural quality of agricultural soils.
The large area in which 161 free-to-swell undisturbed samples were
obtained for this research represents a major part of the Swiss
agricultural land and belongs to one broad soil group (Cambi-Luvisols).
The structural quality was scored visually, and bulk volumes (inverse of
bulk density) were measured at standard matric potentials. To define the
effect of SOC without interference of soil mechanical degradation, soils
with good structural quality scores were considered first in studying
the relationship between SOC and soil pore volumes. Results suggest that
the relationship is always linear, irrespective of the clay content of
the soils. No optimum of SOC corresponding to a fraction of the clay
content is found, contrary to the theory of “complexed organic carbon”
(Dexter et al., 2008). However, the SOC:clay ratio decreases with
decreasing soil structure quality. The SOC:clay ratio of 1:8 is the
average for a very good structure quality. A SOC:clay ratio of 1:10 is
the limit between good and medium structural quality,, thus it
constitutes a reasonable goal for soil management by farmers. A SOC:clay
ratio of 1:8 or smaller leads to a high probability of poor structural
state. These ratios can be used as criteria for soil structural quality
and SOC management, and in that context, the concept of complexed
organic carbon appears relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil hydraulic properties have a predominating impact on soil physical
quality (SPQ) because they directly or indirectly control air and water
storage, infiltration and drainage, nutrient leaching, microbial
activity, greenhouse gas generation, and carbon sequestration. The
hydraulic properties of many soils are often better described using
“bimodal” water content and hydraulic conductivity (theta-K-h)
functions, where the theta-K-h of a large-pore “structure domain” is
combined with the theta-K-h of a small-pore “matrix domain”. This study
uses closed-form bimodal van Genuchten theta-K-h functions to
characterize SPQ from the perspective of storage and transmission of
water and air in soils containing distinct structure and matrix domains.
Consistently good fits were achieved between the soil water content
function, theta(h), and water content data from intact soil, repacked
diatomite pellets, and repacked soil aggregates (R-2 &amp;gt;= 0.9854, RMSE &amp;lt;=
0.0223 m(3) m(-3)), but variable fits were attained between the
hydraulic conductivity function, K(h), and hydraulic conductivity data.
It was found that even though the SPQ of bulk soil may be optimal or
near-optimal, the SPQ of the corresponding structure and matrix domains
could be limited or poor in one or more categories. The structure domain
tended to be water-limited and potentially prone to leaching, while the
matrix domain tended to be aeration-limited and potentially prone to
greenhouse gas generation. It was concluded that maximizing the economic
and environmental performance of field crop production would likely
require selective improvement of structure or matrix SPQ rather than
bulk soil SPQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Environmental conditions like temperature and moisture could affect the
carbon protection capacity of various clay types in soils. Using
dominantly kaolinitic-illitic, smectitic and allophanic soils, we
conducted systematic incubation experiments over 42 days at different
temperatures (4, 22 and 37 degrees C) and moisture contents (30, 60 and
90% of water holding capacity (available water)). The basal respiration
was monitored to study the relative effect of moisture contents and
temperature on the carbon protection capacities and mechanisms of the
three clay types. The results indicated that carbon decomposition
increased with increasing moisture and temperature. A two-component
quadratic equation could explain the carbon mineralisation process. The
highest C respiration was observed at 37 degrees C with a 60% moisture
level in each of the soil types. Under these conditions, the smectitic
soil recorded the highest carbon decomposition followed by the
kaolinitic-illitic and allophanic soils. The study of the priming effect
using C-14 lab-died malic acid confirmed the trend of the bulk
respiration results. The allophanic soil showed the lowest amount of
carbon mineralisation under all experimental conditions. A strong
inverse correlation (R-2 = 0.90 at p &amp;lt; 0.05) was observed between CO2
emission rate and total sesquioxides (Fe and Al oxides) content. As
evidenced by the pore size distribution, micromorphologies and
thermogravimetric analyses, the microporous structure and micrbaggregate
formation in the allophanic soil enhanced carbon sequestration. This
study indicated that soil carbon stabilisation was related more to the
sesquioxides content than to the clay types or their relative specific
surface areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
For agricultural productivity, primary salinity constitutes a hazard.
Understanding the risk of secondary salinization is also important and
it is necessary to map all these hazards and the overall risk. One
approach is digital soil mapping. We have developed hazard maps of root
zone (0-2 m) and subsurface (6-12 m) salinity, as well as groundwater
height, using empirical best linear unbiased prediction using proximal
and remotely sensed ancillary data. To convert the hazards into salinity
risk maps and account for some uncertainty, fuzzy membership functions
(FMF) were used in conjunction with semantic import models that consider
the vulnerability of agricultural crops. Therefore, we developed
memberships (mu) to three salinity risk classes and created maps of
each, including root zone (mu(RSR)) and subsurface (mu(SSR)) salinity,
and depth to groundwater (mu(GTR)). To estimate groundwater (mu(GSR))
and overall salinity risk (mu(OSR)), fuzzy multiple criteria evaluation
was undertaken. To account for mu(GSR), the mu(SSR) and mu(GTR) were
combined using a t-norm operator, and mu(OSR) was accounted for by
combining mu(RSR) and mu(GSR) using a t-conorm operator. The approach
was applied to an area growing irrigated cotton. Cross-validation shows
predicted mu(OSR) was good, with an agreement rate of 70.6%. The
predicted mu(OSR) was consistent with that of many areas affected by
point-source salinity. The method provides an effective way of mapping
salinity hazard and risk. Incorporation of FMF provides a meaningful
continuum of membership and allows the incorporation of uncertainty.
Salinity risk can be calculated relative to any vegetation community and
locations where management actions to moderate soil salinization can be
identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of Digital Soil
Mapping have emerged to respond to the need of land managers. One
important contribution to this effort is the release of regional-scale
soil maps from the GlobalSoilMap (GSM) project. While the GSM project
aims at producing soil property predictions on a fine 90 x 90 m grid at
the global scale, land managers often require aggregated information
over larger areas of interest (e.g. farms, watersheds, municipalities).
This study evaluated a geostatistical procedure aiming at aggregating
GSM grids to a land management scale, thereby providing land suitability
maps with associated uncertainty for the French region
‘Languedoc-Roussillon’ (27 236 km(2)). Specifically, maps were derived
from three GSM prediction grids (pH, organic carbon and clay content) by
calculating the proportion of ‘suitable’ agricultural land within a
municipality, where suitability was defined as having soil property
values below or above a predefined threshold (pH&amp;lt;5.5, OC&amp;lt;10 g/kg,
clay&amp;gt;375 g/kg). Calculation of these nonlinear spatial aggregates and
the associated uncertainty involved a three-step approach: (i) sampling
from the conditional probability distributions of the soil properties at
all grid cells by means of sequential Gaussian simulation applied to a
regression kriging model, (ii) transformation of soil properties to
suitability indicators for all grid cell samples generated in the first
step and (iii) spatial aggregation of the suitability indicators from
grid cells to municipalities. The maps produced show large differences
between municipality areas for all three land suitability indicators.
The uncertainties associated with the aggregated suitability indicators
were moderate. This approach demonstrated that fine-scale GSM products
may also fulfil user demands at coarser land management scales, without
jeopardizing uncertainty quantification requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The concept of soil health has been extensively reviewed in the
scientific literature, but there is only patchy and inconsistent
information available to farmers and growers who are concerned about the
declining condition of their soils and are looking for appropriate test
methods and management interventions to help reverse it. Although there
are well-established laboratory methods for soil chemical analysis, and
a range of laboratory and field methods for measuring soil physical
properties, only now are methods starting to emerge for soil biological
analysis. This study provides an overview of the methods that are
currently available commercially (or are close to commercialization) for
farmers and growers in the UK. We examine the science underpinning the
methods, the value of the information provided and how farmers and
advisors can use results from such assessments for informed
decision-making in relation to soil management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The increased recognition of the importance of soil is reflected in the
UN Post-2015 Development Agenda with sustainable development goals that
directly and indirectly relate to soil quality and protection. Despite a
lack of legally binding legislation for soil protection, the European
Commission remains committed to the objective of soil protection.
However, the achievement of a legally binding framework for soil
protection relies on the implementation of a soil monitoring network
(SMN) that can detect changes to soil quality over time. As
beneficiaries do not pay for the provision of soil information, the
options for soil monitoring are limited. The use of existing data sets
should be considered first. Using Ireland as an example, this research
explored the opportunities for a SMN for Ireland considering three
existing national data sets. The options for a SMN are considered in
terms of their spatial and stratified distribution, the parameters to be
measured and an economic analysis of the options proposed. This research
finds that for Ireland, either a 10 or a 16 km(2) grid interval
stratified by land use and drainage class offers the best potential in
relation to the spatial distribution of existing data sets to reflect
local data at a national level. With existing data, the stratified SIS
data using the 16 km(2) grid offers the best value for money, with
baseline costs for analysis, excluding field costs, of between (sic)706
481 and (sic)2.8 million. Acknowledging the impossibility of measuring
all parameters with ideal frequency, this study proposes a two-tier
system for optimized monitoring frequency. Parameters must anticipate
future policy requirements. Finally, the implementation of a SMN must be
accompanied by standardized methods, defined thresholds and action
mandates to maintain soil quality within allowable limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil class maps are useful representations of the landscape distribution
of holistic soil functions. However these are often only available as
generalized classes at small cartographic scales. One reason is that
allocating a soil profile to a class in most current soil classification
system requires laboratory determination of many diagnostic soil
properties. The advantage of reflectance spectroscopy along with the
development of spectral libraries can provide a relatively low-cost
solution to this problem. Reflectance spectroscopy has demonstrated its
ability to rapidly predict soil physio-chemical properties; however
prediction accuracy varies among soil properties. When properties
predicted with different accuracies are used to substitute for
traditional laboratory determinations in allocating a soil profile to a
class, the resulting reliability of the allocation is questionable. The
objective of this research is to explore whether the soil properties
predicted by reflectance spectroscopy can be used to correctly allocate
soil profiles into soil taxa at different hierarchical levels. Two
hundred and six soil profiles were allocated to eight Orders, 12
Suborders, 23 Groups and 49 Subgroups according to Chinese Soil
Taxonomy, with the help of ten soil properties predicted by spectra
using ten-fold cross-validated PLSR modelling. The overall allocation
accuracy at Order, Suborder, Group and Subgroup level was 98.5%, 98.5%,
87.7% and 76.0% respectively. These results show that soil reflectance
spectroscopy can assist in allocation of profiles. When predicted soil
properties with varying accuracy are used for soil allocation,
propagation of prediction errors and model uncertainties must be
considered. We propose the use of multiple indicators (RPD, confidence
intervals, comparison of RMSE and threshold requirements) to evaluate
the allocation results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Multi-scale soil variations are increasingly employed to improve the
accuracy for digital soil mapping (DSM). In this study, we attempted to
explore a methodology of wavelet analysis on this topic. The terrain
attributes of a study area were decomposed using the wavelet analysis,
and the resulted components were applied to map soil organic carbon
(SOC) content, pH and clay content using multiple linear regression
(MLR) and regression kriging (RK). The results showed that the wavelet
components strengthened soil-landscape relationships in terms of
correlation coefficients, enhanced soil-landscape modelling in terms of
MLR modelling coefficients of determination (R-2). Compared with several
standard DSM approaches, i.e., ordinary kriging (OK), MLR and RK with
the original terrain attributes, the use of wavelet components improved
the prediction accuracy at some scales, but not all the scales. Most of
the improvements were at the slight to moderate levels, e.g.,
3.66-14.24% increases in the accuracy based on mean error, mean absolute
error, root mean square error and R-2. Maps made with wavelet components
were relatively smooth and sometimes contained hotspots due to
characteristics of wavelet components, which differed a lot from those
made by the standard DSM methods. The potential benefits of using
wavelet components as predictors in DSM may be further revealed in the
future when more predictor selection approaches and mapping methods are
considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
As soil oxidizable carbon (Cox) has several different absorptions in the
visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) region due to its complex
composition, multivariate calibration techniques such as multiple linear
regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support
vector machines (SVM) or random forest (RF) can be advantageously used
to obtain a good prediction. Besides that, the content of Cox is often
affected by the character of the terrain, mainly due to prevailing water
regime with associated transport and sedimentation processes. Therefore,
the question arises; if predictive models calibrated by combining
vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (vis-NIR DRS, 350-2500 nm) and
the digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives will provide a more
accurate estimate of Cox. Focused on a sloping arable land (100 ha)
affected by distinct water erosion, we tested for this purpose two
conceptually different predictive approaches that differ in the nature
of the spectroscopic predictor variables. In Approach A that relied on
absorption feature (AF) parameters, the inclusion of DEM derivatives
resulted in improved Cox prediction using all the tested calibration
techniques, i.e. MLR, RF, PLSR and SVM. The MLR prediction that was the
most accurate among all others improved from R-CV(2) = 0.81 (vis-NIR DRS
dataset) or 0.50 (DEM derivatives dataset) to 0.84 (combination of
both). For that prediction especially AF centered at 500, 700, 900,
1800, 1900, 2200 and 2400 rim, as well as elevation, IS factor and plan
curvature were important. In contrast, in the Approach B that relied on
reflectance (RF and PLSR) or normalized reflectance (SVM) values at each
wavelength, no positive effect of inclusion of DEM derivatives was
observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This study evaluates the use of magnetic properties as an indicator of
weathering of tropical soils. Soil samples collected across the tropical
belt were analysed for magnetic susceptibility and its frequency
dependence. Frequency dependence is caused by superparamagnetic (SP)
ferrimagnetic nanoparticles, which are commonly attributed to
neoformation during soil forming processes. Magnetic properties are
compared to the redness rating of soil colour, which is related to the
hematite content and is an established proxy for soil weathering. The
investigated samples comprise material of different weathering stages
from unweathered and weathered rock to subsoil and strongly weathered
topsoil. They cover a broad variety of parent materials: ultrabasic,
basic, intermediate, acid igneous rocks, clays and clay slates,
phyllites and sandstones. The results show that soil reddening, magnetic
susceptibility and in particular frequency-dependent susceptibility
generally increase with proceeding weathering. However, there is a
lithologic overprint and the parent material has to be taken into
consideration. Soils stemming from acid igneous rocks, clays, clay
slates and phyllites show a positive correlation between reddening and
susceptibility or frequency dependent susceptibility, rendering these
properties suitable for indicating weathering. In contrast, soils
stemming from ultrabasic, basic and intermediate igneous rocks and
sandstones show no significant correlation. The reason is the strong
lithogenic overprint of ferrimagnetic minerals including SP particles,
which commonly occur in these rock types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Increasingly, the frequency domain electromagnetic induction (EMI)
method is used to study soil properties and hydrological properties on
different scales. Yet, EMI data are most often used as they are or with
the low induction number approximation. Moreover, reported studies have
been fairly small (&amp;lt; 100 ha) and to our best knowledge quantitative
comparisons with boreholes have not been reported. In the present study
we collect, process and invert a 1000 ha EMI data set, and we directly
compare the EMI data with borehole data. EMI data were collected with a
line spacing of 20 m, resulting in approximately 110,000 processed
soundings, which were inverted with a full non-linear algorithm. The EMI
results were then evaluated against lithological information from 125
boreholes. The results show that with an EMI instrument we can map the
shallow (&amp;lt; 6 m) architecture on small-catchment scale (1000s ha) in a
complicated glacial sedimentary environment. The mapping of the
geological units was evaluated by a quantitative analysis in which we
developed a general methodology for directly comparing EMI results and
borehole data. After linking geological units to measured resistivities,
we found that 103 out of 125 boreholes were reproduced by the EMI
results. We attributed the few non-reproducible boreholes to be caused
by local scale geological units, abrupt lateral variations in either
geology or resistivity, and inaccurate borehole coordinates. We conclude
that EMI can provide the architectural input with the necessary detail
and quality to characterize areas of up to 1000s ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes tools and technologies to identify
in-field soil and crop variability for improving farming practices and
optimizing agronomic inputs. Traditionally, optical remote sensing (RS)
that utilizes visible light and infrared regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum has been used as an integral part of PA for crop and soil
monitoring. Optical RS, however, is slow in differentiating stress
levels in crops until visual symptoms become noticeable. Surface
temperature is considered to be a rapid response variable that can
indicate crop stresses prior to their visual symptoms. By measuring
estimates of surface temperature, thermal RS has been found to be a
promising tool for PA. Compared to optical RS, applications of thermal
RS for PA have been limited. Until recently (i.e., before the
advancement of low cost RS platforms such as unmanned aerial systems
(UAVs)), the availability of high resolution thermal images was limited
due to high acquisition costs. Given recent developments in UAVs,
thermal images with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become
available at a low cost, which has increased opportunities to understand
in-field variability of crop and soil conditions useful for various
agronomic decision-making. Before thermal RS is adopted as a routine
tool for crop and environmental monitoring, there is a need to
understand its current and potential applications as well as issues and
concerns. This review focuses on current and potential applications of
thermal RS in PA as well as some concerns relating to its application.
The application areas of thermal RS in agriculture discussed here
include irrigation scheduling, drought monitoring, crop disease
detection, and mapping of soil properties, residues and tillage, field
tiles, and crop maturity and yield. Some of the issues related to its
application include spatial and temporal resolution, atmospheric
conditions, and crop growth stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Comparing functional similarity in reconstructed ecosystems with natural
benchmarks can provide ecologically meaningful information to measure
reclamation success. We examined nutrient supply rate using ion-exchange
resins as a measure of ecosystem function in two oil sands reclaimed
soils, viz. peat mineral mix (PMM) and forest floor mineral mix (FFMM),
and measured fertilization effect on nutrient supply rates in these
soils for three consecutive years contrasted with young-fire-disturbed
and mature forest stands. Results indicated that nutrient profiles of
reclaimed soils were significantly different than natural benchmarks.
Phosphorus and potassium supply rates in reclaimed soils were up to 91%
lower, whereas S, Ca, and Mg were, respectively, up to 95%, 62%, and 74%
higher than in benchmark soils. The expected nutrient flush
postfertilization was only apparent in N and P, but the transient effect
levelled off the year after fertilization in most cases. Fertilization
aligned the temporal trajectory of the nutrient profile in PMM similar
to benchmark conditions indicating greater ecological benefit of
fertilization than in FFMM. The findings from this study suggest that
fertilization focusing on P and K is likely more ecologically
appropriate for establishing natural ecosystem function on reclaimed
soils in this region of the boreal forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Magnetic susceptibility (chi) is a simple and quick technique to
determine soil properties and to describe soil forming processes.
Knowledge about factors affecting chi data helps better interpretation.
Magnetic susceptibility of soils along a lithotoposequence was studied
in this research in order to investigate the effects of soil forming
factors (parent material and relief) and processes on the chi content
and its vertical distribution. The study area is a transect from Jiroft
to Kahnooj area, south Kerman Province, Iran. Rock pediment, mantled
pediment, inselberg, alluvial fan, alluvial plain, and flood plain
landforms with igneous parent materials (gabbro, diorite, and granite)
were selected in the area. Thirteen representative pedons on different
geomorphic positions were studied. Low frequency chi (chi lf) values
ranged from 193.1 x 10-8 m(3) kg(-1) to 2704.2 x 10-8 m(3) kg(-1) in
studied soils and decreased with increasing diamagnetic material
contents. Mean chi lf values in soils formed on gabbro, diorite, and
granite parent rock were &amp;gt; 1700 x 10(-8) ma kg(-1), 515.22 x 10(-8) m(3)
kg(-1), and 352.53 x 10(-8) m(3) kg(-1), respectively. Frequency
dependent chi of soils (in the range of 0.06 to 1.05%) showed that
coarse multi domain grains inherited from igneous parent material were
the main source of chi lf in the area under study. Both increasing and
decreasing trends of chi lf with depth were observed. Decreasing trend
of chi lf with depth was due to illuviation of diamagnetic material into
subsurface layers. On the other hand, increasing chi lf with depth was
attributed to the primary ferrimagnetic material inherited from igneous
parent material. Alluvial plain (320.44 x 10(-8) m(3) kg(-1)) and
mantled pediment (328.50 x 10(-8) m(3) kg(-1)) showed low values of chi
lf due to high amounts of soluble salts, anhydrite, and calcium
carbonate investigated in these geomorphic positions. A positive
significant relationship (R-2 = 0.018; r = 0.27, P &amp;lt; 0.05) between chi
lf and Fe-o/Fe-d activity ratio was found. Soil chi lf decreased with
development and relative dating of soils. Results of the study showed
that soil chi lf values were highly affected by parent material, relief,
and soil development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Accurate estimation of the crop coefficient (K-c) is crucial for
estimating actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) and planning appropriate
irrigation management for efficient crop yield. In this study,
satellite-based K-c values were estimated at cropland and mixed forest
sites based on the dual crop coefficient approach using merged soil
moisture from the European Space Agency as an indicator of evaporation
from soil, as well as the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the
Leaf Area Index (LAI) to explain the effect of transpiration from
plants. Comparison of the seasonal patterns and Pearson’s correlation
coefficient (r) of NDVI, LAI, and surface soil moisture with K-c
indicated that it was reasonable to use the three variables as
independent variables to estimate K-c. Based on these results, the
satellite -based K-c estimated using NDVI, LAI, and soil moisture (Case
1) was compared with the K-c calculated from NDVI and LAI (Case 2) and
the flux towers at the significance level of 0.05. The statistical
results confirmed that the K-c estimated from Case 1 (Bias: -0.012 to
0.053, RMSE: 0.144 to 0.172, and r: 0.463 to 0.800) showed better
agreement with the observed K-c than that estimated from Case 2 (Bias:
-0.058 to 0.088, RMSE: 0.146 to 0.221, and r: 0.434 to 0.788). Among the
three variables, soil moisture had the greatest impact on the rice
paddy, while the NDVI showed the highest influence on the mixed forest.
Based on these results, K-c estimated from Case 1 was multiplied by
MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based potential
crop evapotranspiration and compared with the latent heat flux from flux
towers. ETa showed reasonable bias (cropland: -0.224 to 1.364, mixed
forest: 0.711 to 1.055), RMSE (cropland: 1.952 to 2.126, mixed forest:
1.085 to 1.878) and r (cropland: 0.529 to 0.832, mixed forest: 0.850 to
0.909) at all of the study sites. After validation of the satellite
-based K-c approach under various vegetation types and climate
conditions, this approach can be employed not only for developing
adequate water and agricultural management plans, but also for analyzing
and predicting crop yield productivity and agricultural drought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The development of a MATLAB based computer code, AP3DMT, for modeling
and inversion of 3D Magnetotelluric (MT) data is presented. The code
comprises two independent components: grid generator code and
modeling/inversion code. The grid generator code performs model
discretization and acts as an interface by generating various I/O files.
The inversion code performs core computations in modular form forward
modeling, data functionals, sensitivity computations and regularization.
These modules can be readily extended to other similar inverse problems
like Controlled-Source EM (CSEM). The modular structure of the code
provides a framework useful for implementation of new applications and
inversion algorithms. The use of MATLAB and its libraries makes it more
compact and user friendly. The code has been validated on several
published models. To demonstrate its versatility and capabilities the
results of inversion for two complex models are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
All of the quantitative landslide susceptibility mapping (QLSM) methods
requires two basic data types, namely, landslide inventory and factors
that influence landslide occurrence (landslide influencing factors,
LIF). Depending on type of landslides, nature of triggers and LIF,
accuracy of the QLSM methods differs. Moreover, how to balance the
number of 0 (nonoccurrence) and 1 (occurrence) in the training set
obtained from the landslide inventory and how to select which one of the
1’s and 0’s to be included in QLSM models play critical role in the
accuracy of the QLSM. Although performance of various QLSM methods is
largely investigated in the literature, the challenge of training set
construction is not adequately investigated for the QLSM methods. In
order to tackle this challenge, in this study three different training
set selection strategies along with the original data set is used for
testing the performance of three different regression methods namely
Logistic Regression (LR), Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) and Fuzzy
Logistic Regression (FLR). The first sampling strategy is proportional
random sampling (PRS), which takes into account a weighted selection of
landslide occurrences in the sample set. The second method, namely
non-selective nearby sampling (NNS), includes randomly selected sites
and their surrounding neighboring points at certain preselected
distances to include the impact of clustering. Selective nearby sampling
(SNS) is the third method, which concentrates on the group of l’s and
their surrounding neighborhood. A randomly selected group of landslide
sites and their neighborhood are considered in the analyses similar to
NNS parameters. It is found that LR-PRS, FLR-PRS and BLR-Whole Data
set-ups, with order, yield the best fits among the other alternatives.
The results indicate that in QLSM based on regression models, avoidance
of spatial correlation in the data set is critical for the model’s
performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Software packages for spatial data often implement a hybrid approach of
interpreted and compiled programming languages. The compiled parts are
usually written in C, C++, or Fortran, and are efficient in terms of
computational speed and memory usage. Conversely, the interpreted part
serves as a convenient user interface and calls the compiled code for
computationally demanding operations. The price paid for the user
friendliness of the interpreted component is besides performance the
limited access to low level and optimized code. An example of such a
restriction is the 64-bit vector support of the widely used statistical
language R. On the R side, users do not need to change existing code and
may not even notice the extension. On the other hand, interfacing 64-bit
compiled code efficiently is challenging. Since many R packages for
spatial data could benefit from 64-bit vectors, we investigate
strategies to efficiently pass 64-bit vectors to compiled languages.
More precisely, we show how to simply extend existing R packages using
the foreign function interface to seamlessly support 64-bit vectors.
This extension is shown with the sparse matrix algebra R package spam.
The new capabilities are illustrated with an example of GIMMS NDVI3g
data featuring a parametric modeling approach for a non-stationary
covariance matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Good estimates of ecosystem complexity are essential for a number of
ecological tasks: from biodiversity estimation, to forest structure
variable retrieval, to feature extraction by edge detection and
generation of multifractal surface as neutral models for e.g. feature
change assessment. Hence, measuring ecological complexity over space
becomes crucial in macroecology and geography. Many geospatial tools
have been advocated in spatial ecology to estimate ecosystem complexity
and its changes over space and time. Among these tools, free and open
source options especially offer opportunities to guarantee the
robustness of algorithms and reproducibility. In this paper we will
summarize the most straightforward measures of spatial complexity
available in the Free and Open Source Software GRASS GIS, relating them
to key ecological patterns and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Clay minerals play a crucial role in the processability of oil sands
ores and in the management of tailings. An increase in fine content
generally leads to a decrease in both bitumen recovery performance and
tailings settling rate. It is thus important to identify clay types and
their abundance in oil sands ores and tailings. This study made use of
oil sands samples characterized for quantitative mineralogy by x-ray
diffraction, to gain an understanding of changes in the reflectance
spectra of oil sands. The sample suite included bitumen-removed oil
sands ore samples and their different fine size fractions. Spectral
metrics applicable to the prediction of quartz and clay contents in oil
sands were then derived with a focus on metrics correlating with sample
content in total 2:1 clays (total of illite and illite-smectite) and
kaolinite. Metrics in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and longwave
infrared (LWIR) were found to correlate with mineral contents. The best
predictions of clays and quartz were achieved using LWIR metrics (R-2 &amp;gt;
0.89). Results also demonstrated the applicability of LWIR metrics in
the prediction of kaolinite and total 2:1 clays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Improving crop area and/or crop yields in agricultural regions is one of
the foremost scientific challenges for the next decades. This is
especially true in irrigated areas because sustainable intensification
of irrigated crop production is virtually the sole means to enhance food
supply and contribute to meeting food demands of a growing population.
Yet, irrigated crop production worldwide is suffering from soil
degradation and salinity, reduced soil fertility, and water scarcity
rendering the performance of irrigation schemes often below potential.
On the other hand, the scope for improving irrigated agricultural
productivity remains obscure also due to the lack of spatial data on
agricultural production (e.g. crop acreage and yield). To fill this gap,
satellite earth observations and a replicable methodology were used to
estimate crop yields at the field level for the period 2010/2014 in the
Fergana Valley, Central Asia, to understand the response of agricultural
productivity to factors related to the irrigation and drainage
infrastructure and environment. The results showed that cropping
pattern, i.e. the presence or absence of multi-annual crop rotations,
and spatial diversity of crops had the most persistent effects on crop
yields across observation years suggesting the need for introducing
sustainable cropping systems. On the other hand, areas with a lower crop
diversity or abundance of crop rotation tended to have lower crop
yields, with differences of partly more than one t/ha yield. It is
argued that factors related to the infrastructure, for example, the
distance of farms to the next settlement or the density of roads, had a
persistent effect on crop yield dynamics over time. The improvement
potential of cotton and wheat yields were estimated at 5%, compared to
crop yields of farms in the direct vicinity of settlements or roads. In
this study it is highlighted how remotely sensed estimates of crop
production in combination with geospatial technologies provide a unique
perspective that, when combined with field surveys, can support planners
to identify management priorities for improving regional production
and/or reducing environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The aim of this study is to estimate the capabilities of forecasting the
yield of wheat using an artificial neural network combined with
multi-temporal satellite data acquired at high spatial resolution
throughout the agricultural season in the optical and/or microwave
domains. Reflectance (acquired by Formosat-2, and Spot 4-5 in the green,
red, and near infrared wavelength) and multi-configuration
backscattering coefficients (acquired by TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 in
the X- and C-bands, at co- (abbreviated HH and VV) and
cross-polarization states (abbreviated HV and VH)) constitute the input
variable of the artificial neural networks, which are trained and
validated on the successively acquired images, providing yield forecast
in near real-time conditions. The study is based on data collected over
32 fields of wheat distributed over a study area located in southwestern
France, near Toulouse. Among the tested sensor configurations, several
satellite data appear useful for the yield forecasting throughout the
agricultural season (showing coefficient of determination (R-2) larger
than 0.60 and a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 9.1 quintals by
hectare (q ha(-1))): C-vH, C-Hv, or the combined used of X-HH and C-HH,
C-HH and C-Hv, or green reflectance and C-HH. Nevertheless, the best
accurate forecast (R-2 = 0.76 and RMSE= 7.0 q ha(-1)) is obtained
longtime before the harvest (on day 98, during the elongation of stems)
using the combination of co- and cross-polarized backscattering
coefficients acquired in the C-band (C-vv and C-vH). These results
highlight the high interest of using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
instead of optical ones to early forecast the yield before the harvest
of wheat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Hyperspectral images provide rich spectral and spatially continuous
information that can be used for soil mineralogy discrimination. This
paper proposes a method to evaluate the feasibility of Hyperion image in
the rapid prediction of soil mineralogy. Four areas in Egypt were chosen
for the current study. Preprocessing of the Hyperion data was done
before applying the atmospheric correction. The minimum noise fraction
transformation was used to segregate noise in the data. Various
techniques were applied to the studied areas in which mixture tune
matched filtering gave good results in a prediction of the end-members.
Then, it employed to predict soil minerals in each cell using a spectral
unmixing method. Illite, chlorite, calcite, dolomite, kaolinite,
smectite, quartz, hematite, goethite, vermiculite, palygorskite and some
feldspar were identified. In addition, sand and limestone, calcite and
dolomite, and sand surface from similarly bright clouds can be
distinguished easily based on the proposed method. The soil minerals
obtained from X-ray diffraction analysis of the soil samples are in
conformity with spectrally dominant mineralogy from Hyperion data.
Different minerals can be identified using this method without any
knowledge of field spectra or any a priori field data, thus configuring
a “true” remote sensing method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The soil water retention curve (WRC) plays a major role in a soil’s
hydrodynamic behavior. Many measurement techniques are currently
available for determining the WRC in the laboratory. Direct in situ WRC
can be obtained from simultaneous soil moisture and water potential
readings covering a wide tension range, from saturation to the wilting
point. There are many widely used soil moisture probes. Whereas
near-saturation tension can be measured using water-filled tensiometers,
wider ranges of water potential require new, more expensive, and less
widely used probes. We compared three types of soil water potential
sensors that could allow us to measure water potential in the field,
with a range relevant to water uptake by plants. Polymer tensiometers
(POTs), MPS-2 probes, and pF meters were compared in a controlled drying
experiment. The study showed that the POTs and MPS-2 probes had good
reliability in their respective ranges. Combined with a soil moisture
probe, these two sensors can provide observed WRCs. The pF meters below
-30 kPa were inaccurate, and their response was sensitive to measurement
interval, with greater estimated suction at shorter measurement
intervals. In situ WRC can provide supplementary information,
particularly with regard to its spatial and temporal variability. It
could also improve the results of other measurement techniques, such as
geophysical observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper explores the use of a novel nonlinear parametric modelling
technique based on a Volterra Non-linear Regressive with eXogenous
inputs (VNRX) method to quantify the individual, interaction and overall
contributions of six soil properties on crop yield and normalised
difference vegetation index (NDVI). The proposed technique has been
applied on high sampling resolution data of soil total nitrogen (TN) in
%, total carbon (TC) in %, potassium (K) in cmol kg(-1), pH, phosphorous
(P) in mg kg-I and moisture content (MC) in %, collected with an on-line
visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy sensor from a 18 ha
field in Bedfordshire, UK over 2013 (wheat) and 2015 (spring barley)
cropping seasons. The online soil data were first subjected to a raster
analysis to produce a common 5 m by 5 m grid, before they were used as
inputs into the VNRX model, whereas crop yield and NDVI represented
system outputs. Results revealed that the largest contributions commonly
observed for both yield and NDVI were from K, P and TC. The highest sum
of the error reduction ratio (SERR) of 48.59% was calculated with the
VNRX model for NDVI, which was in line with the highest correlation
coefficient (r) of 0.71 found between measured and predicted NDVI.
However, on-line measured soil properties led to larger contributions to
early measured NDVI than to a late measurement in the growing season.
The performance of the VNRX model was better for NDVI than for yield,
which was attributed to the exclusion of the influence of crop diseases,
appearing at late growing stages. It was recommended to adopt the VNRX
method for quantifying the contribution of on-line collected soil
properties to crop NDVI and yield. However, it is important for future
work to include additional soil properties and to account for other
factors affecting crop growth and yield, to improve the performance of
the VNRX model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of physicochemical
parameters (pH, water activity, free acidity, refraction index, Brix,
moisture content and ash content), color parameters (L&lt;em&gt;, a&lt;/em&gt;, b*, chroma,
hue angle and yellow index) and phenolics (quercetin, apigenin,
myricetin, isorhamnetin, kaempherol, caffeic acid, chrysin, galangin,
luteolin, p-coumaric acid, gallic acid and pinocembrin) in view of
classifying honeys according to their botanical origin (acacia, tilia,
sunflower, honeydew and polyfloral). Thus, the classification of honeys
has been made using the principal component analysis (PCA), linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The
multilayer perceptron network with 2 hidden layers classified correctly
94.8% of the cross validated samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) based sensing systems have improved
capabilities to precisely monitor environmental conditions. Plants are
sessile organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused
due to surrounding environmental conditions such as soil water content,
pest/disease infestation, and soil health. High-resolution sensing
(Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems) of agrometeorological
parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil
continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World
for precision agriculture purposes. Although there have been many
improvements in the communication aspects of the WSN’s, the data
dissemination and near real-time analysis components for taking dynamic
decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured. The
current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery,
access, and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across
various distributed sensor networks. This study addresses above issues
through the adaptation of a framework based on Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). For
precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized
sensing system (hardware and software) has been developed, which
includes functionalities such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring,
tools for crop water requirement estimation, pest, disease monitoring,
and nutrient management. Also, the modeling techniques were integrated
with the interoperable web-enabled sensing system for addressing water
management problems of horticultural crops in semi-arid areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Agricultural production has become a key factor for the stability of the
world economy. The use of pesticides provides a more favorable
environment for the crops in agricultural production. However, the
uncontrolled and inappropriate use of pesticides affect the environment
by polluting preserved areas and damaging ecosystems. In the precision
agriculture literature, several authors have proposed solutions based on
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for
developing spraying processes that are safer and more precise than the
use of manned agricultural aircraft. However, the static configuration
usually adopted in these proposals makes them inefficient in
environments with changing weather conditions (e.g. sudden changes of
wind speed and direction). To overcome this deficiency, this paper
proposes a computer-based system that is able to autonomously adapt the
UAV control rules, while keeping precise pesticide deposition on the
target fields. Different versions of the proposal, with autonomously
route adaptation metaheuristics based on Genetic Algorithms, Particle
Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing and Hill-Climbing for optimizing
the intensity of route changes are evaluated in this study.
Additionally, this study evaluates the use of a ground control station
and an embedded hardware to run the route adaptation metaheuristics.
Experimental results show that the proposed computer-based system
approach with autonomous route change metaheuristics provides more
precise changes in the UAV’s flight route, with more accurate deposition
of the pesticide and less environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper evaluates the performance of different soil moisture products
from AMSR2 and SMOS against the most representative stations within the
Yanco study area in the Murrumbidgee catchment, in southeast Australia.
AMSR2 Level 3 (L3) soil moisture products retrieved from two versions of
brightness temperatures using the Japanese Aerospace eXploration Agency
(JAXA) and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm were
included. For the LPRM algorithm, two different parameterization methods
were applied. Furthermore, two versions of SMOS L3 soil moisture product
were assessed. The results are contrasted against the use of “random”
stations. Accounting for all versions, frequencies and overpasses, the
latest versions of the JAXA UX2) and LPRM (LP3) products were found to
surpass the earlier versions (JX1, LP1 and LP2). Soil moisture retrieval
based on the latter version of brightness temperature and
parameterization scheme improved when C-band observations were used but
not X-band. However, X-band retrievals (r: 0.71, MAE: 0.07, RMSD: 0.08
m3/m3) were found to perform better than C-band (r: 0.68-0.70, MAE:
0.070.09 m(3)/m(3), RMSD: 0.09-0.10 m(3)/m(3)). Moreover, an
intercomparison between different acquisition times (morning and
evening) of AMSR2 X-band products found a better performance from
evening overpasses (1:30 pm; r: 0.69-0.77) as opposed to morning
overpasses (1:30 am; r: 0.47-0.66). In the case of SMOS, morning (6:00
am; r: 0.77) retrievals were found to be superior over evening (6:00 pm;
r: 0.69) retrievals. Overall, both versions of JAXA products, the second
and third versions of LPRM X-band products, and two versions of SMOS
products were found to meet the mean average error (MAE) goal accuracy
of the AMSR2 mission (MAE &amp;lt; 0.08 m(3)/m(3)) but none of the products
achieved the SMOS goal of RMSD &amp;lt; 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Furthermore,
performance of the products differed depending on the statistic used to
evaluate them. Consequently, considering the results in this study, JX2
products are recommended if both absolute and temporal accuracy of the
soil moisture product is of importance, whereas LP3(x) products from
evening observations and SMOS version 3.00 (SMOS2) products from morning
overpasses are recommended if temporal accuracy is of greater
importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read on if you more more information about the research that this poster summarizes. And don’t hesitate to leave some comments at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have gotten to this site via the QR code on the poster, please read the following description of how the figure showing the expected minimum suitability rating was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short summary is that the map is an output of a land suitability analysis for hazelnuts across the Meander Valley irrigation area in north western Tasmania, Australia. Further contextual information about this area and land suitability analysis in general throughout Tasmania can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/agriculture/investing-in-irrigation/enterprise-suitability-toolkit&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is special about this map is that it is the result of incorporating all the quantified uncertainties that were derived for each of the suitability variables as summarized in the table matrix displayed at the top of the poster. The methods for quantifying the uncertainties of each of the variables is described in &lt;a href=&quot;/downloads/journal/malone2015_6.pdf&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;. We also encoded the threshold criteria from the table into a set of continuous membership functions. The use of membership functions as an alternative to discrete threshold cutoffs recognizes that the absolute values used in the suitability analysis can be handled in a less strict manner. For example a discrete threshold of soil pH 5.5 could mean a soil is classified either as suitable or unsuitable if the site was 5.5 or 5.4 respectively. The use of continuous membership functions allows some wiggle room around this by expressing suitability as somewhere along a gradient between 0 and 1, with 1 being suitable and 0 being unsuitable. We may express the continuous memberships with a number of different functions to describe the relationship between the target variable characteristic and suitability. For example common membership functions include the parabolic function (which could be used to describe soil pH), the sigmoid function (could be used for soil depth perhaps), and the inverted sigmoid function (could be used for soil stoniness or conductivity). Or very simply the relationship could be expressed as a linear function. The poster shows the former 3 examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Malone et al. (2015) paper the analysis did not include the incorporation of membership functions for each of the hazelnut suitability variables. Nevertheless, the uncertainties of the variables themselves were handled by a simulation approach where with some clever re sampling approach we were able to generate different realizations of the variables and pass each one through an encoded representation of the suitability matrix table for hazelnuts. We generated many hundreds of realizations which when combined together allowed us the estimate the probability of whether each point on the mapping area was well suited, suited, moderately suited, or unsuited for hazelnut production. In the analysis conducted for this poster we included the continuous membership functions for each variable. Specifically these were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soil depth. Sigmoid function. Soil depth was modeled in a two step process, such that soil depth was modeled as a binary variable to predict the occurrence of soils less than or equal to 50cm and soils greater than 50cm depth. With soils less than or equal to 50cm, an additional model step was implemented to predict the soil depth. The digital soil mapping steps were all conducted so that we could quantify the associated uncertainties. These uncertainties were considered in the ensuing suitability analysis. By observing the relationship of suitability and soil depth as summarized on the suitability matrix, it is clear that a sigmoid function would be appropriate here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soil pH. Parabolic function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soil conductivity. Inverted sigmoid function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soil texture. Parabolic function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soil drainage. Sigmoid function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soil stoniness. Inverted sigmoid function. Like soil depth this variable was modelled in a two-step procedure. This included a model to predict the presence or absence of stones followed by a model where stones were present to predict the main size fraction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frost. Inverted sigmoid function.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Temperature. Parabolic function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rainfall (March). Inverted sigmoid function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the suitability analysis is no longer in the realm of designating a site to a specific class of suitability - as it is now expressed on a grading system due to the continuous membership function - it is slightly altered to what was conducted in Malone et al. (2015). The simulation approach still holds, however at each grid cell location, all the simulations are stacked for each variable before taking the average. We then take the minimum averaged membership probability between all suitability variables. This is equivalent to a most limiting factor approach, except we express it as the minimum probability found from each of the suitability variables at each grid cell location. Although not shown on the poster, with this approach we can also for each suitability variable, map the median and lower and upper prediction limits of the suitability analysis. We can also evaluate whether there may be multi-factor issues in relation to the suitability analysis. This is evaluated by working out the whether if more than one suitability variable has a rating of less than 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while taking account of uncertainties in a digital land suitably assessment may change oftentimes optimistic outcomes as derived from an analysis that considers parameters to be error-free, it is important to conduct the analysis in a realistic and fair framework. This is one where we incorporate as best we can all the sources of uncertainty into the analysis. The approach described in Malone et al. (2015) and the additional analysis used in the research that is summarized in this poster is but one way of conducting a enterprise suitability analysis. There is likely to be simpler or more complex approaches that are very different to what was conducted here. We have just merely tried to advance the most-limiting factor approach to suitability analysis by framing it within a digital soil mapping approach where uncertainties can be explicitly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeing an increasing activity in land resource assessments (LSA) at varying spatial scales throughout the world. These efforts have been largely assisted by suites of digital information technologies such as digital soil and climate modeling and mapping, and associated environmental resource mapping such as remote sensing data and digital elevation models. A common scenario however is that these digital LSAs are made with the assumption that the input information is error free. Similarly, the criteria with which assessments are made are often discretely defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper we briefly review the status quo of digital land suitability analysis. The study then focuses on Tasmania, Australia where there has been the integration within Government policy and directives, a fully digital LSA system for a number of specific agricultural enterprises. Here we address two issues that present limitations to current LSAs. First we take into account the quantified uncertainties of the input variables. Secondly, we adopt membership functions rather than discrete threshold values for the assessment criteria.&lt;br /&gt;
For taking into account the input variable uncertainties, simulations are used to generate plausible realizations of soil and climatic variables for input into an LSA. It is found that when comparing to a LSA that assumes inputs to be error free, there is a significant difference in the assessment of suitability. Using an approach that assumes inputs to be error free, 56% of the selected study area was predicted to be suitable for hazelnuts (our selected agricultural enterprise). Using the simulation approach it is revealed that there is considerable uncertainty about the ‘error free’ assessment, where a prediction of ‘unsuitable’ was made 66% of the time (on average) at each grid cell of the study area. In the specific case of our study area, the cause of this difference is that digital soil mapping of both soil pH and conductivity have a high quantified uncertainty in this study area.  The use of parameter membership functions and or adopting expert rules around soil properties that can be easily managed, we find penalties for taking into account uncertainties are not as severe. Despite differences between the comparative methods, taking account of the prediction uncertainties provide a realistic appraisal of enterprise suitability. It is advantageous also because suitability assessments are provided as continuous variables as opposed to discrete classifications. We would recommend for other studies that consider similar FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations) land evaluation framework type suitability assessments, that parameter membership functions together with the simulation approach are used in concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Random forest is a classification technique widely used in remote
sensing. One of its advantages is that it produces an estimation of
classification accuracy based on the so called out-of-bag
cross-validation method. It is usually assumed that such estimation is
not biased and may be used instead of validation based on an external
data-set or a cross-validation external to the algorithm.In this paper
we show that this is not necessarily the case when classifying remote
sensing imagery using training areas with several pixels or objects.
According to our results, out-of-bag cross-validation clearly
overestimates accuracy, both overall and per class. The reason is that,
in a training patch, pixels or objects are not independent (from a
statistical point of view) of each other; however, they are split by
bootstrapping into in bag and out-of-bag as if they were really
independent. We believe that putting whole patch, rather than
pixels/objects, in one or the other set would produce a less biased
out-of-bag cross-validation. To deal with the problem, we propose a
modification of the random forest algorithm to split training patches
instead of the pixels (or objects) that compose them. This modified
algorithm does not overestimate accuracy and has no lower predictive
capability than the original. When its results are validated with an
external data-set, the accuracy is not different from that obtained with
the original algorithm.We analysed three remote sensing images with
different classification approaches (pixel and object based); in the
three cases reported, the modification we propose produces a less biased
accuracy estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
A rule-based topology software system providing a highly flexible and
fast procedure to enforce integrity in spatial relationships among
datasets is presented. This improved topology rule system is built over
the spatial extension Jaspa. Both projects are open source, freely
available software developed by the corresponding author of this
paper.Currently, there is no spatial DBMS that implements a rule-based
topology engine (considering that the topology rules are designed and
performed in the spatial backend). If the topology rules are applied in
the frontend (as in many GIS desktop programs), ArcGIS is the most
advanced solution. The system presented in this paper has several major
advantages over the ArcGIS approach: it can be extended with new
topology rules, it has a much wider set of rules, and it can mix feature
attributes with topology rules as filters. In addition, the topology
rule system can work with various DBMSs, including PostgreSQL, H2 or
Oracle, and the logic is performed in the spatial backend.The proposed
topology system allows users to check the complex spatial relationships
among features (from one or several spatial layers) that require some
complex cartographic datasets, such as the data specifications proposed
by INSPIRE in Europe and the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) for
Cadastral data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil moisture sensors are increasingly deployed in sensor networks for
both agronomic research and precision agriculture. Soil-specific
calibration improves the accuracy of soil water content sensors, but
laboratory calibration of individual sensors is not practical for
networks installed across heterogeneous settings. Using daily water
content readings collected from a sensor network (42 locations x 5
depths = 210 sensors) installed at the Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) near
Pullman, Washington, we developed an automated calibration approach that
can be applied to individual sensors after installation. As a first
step, we converted sensor-based estimates of apparent dielectric
permittivity to volumetric water content using three different
calibration equations (Topp equation, CAF laboratory calibration, and
the complex refractive index model, or CRIM). In a second,
“re-calibration” step, we used two pedotransfer functions based upon
particle size fractions and/or bulk density to estimate water content at
wilting point, field capacity, and saturation at each sensor insertion
point. Using an automated routine, we extracted the same three reference
points, when present, from each sensor’s record, and then bias corrected
and re-scaled the sensor data to match the estimated reference points.
Based on validation with field-collected cores, the Topp equation
provided the most accurate calibration with an RMSE of 0.074 m(3) m(-3),
but automated re-calibration with a local pedotransfer function
outperformed any of the calibrations alone, yielding a network-wide RMSE
of 0.055 m(3) m(-3). The initial calibration equation used in the first
step was irrelevant when the re-calibration was applied. After
correcting for the reference core measurement error of 0.026 m(3) m(-3)
used for calibration and validation, the error of the sensors alone
(RMSEadj) was computed as 0.049 m(3) m(-3). Sixty-five percent of
individual sensors exhibited re calibration errors less than or equal to
the network RMSEadj. The incorporation of soil physical information at
sensor installation sites, applied retroactively via an automated
routine to in situ soil water content sensors, substantially improved
network sensor accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
