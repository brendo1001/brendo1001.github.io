&lt;p&gt;Modeling has become an indispensable tool for scientific research. However, models generate great uncertainty when they are used to predict or forecast ecosystem responses to global change. This uncertainty is partly due to parameterization, which is an essential procedure for model specification via defining parameter values for a model. The classic doctrine of parameterization is that a parameter is constant. However, it is commonly known from modeling practice that a model that is well calibrated for its parameters at one site may not simulate well at another site unless its parameters are tuned again. This common practice implies that parameter values have to vary with sites. Indeed, parameter values that are estimated using a statistically rigorous approach, that is, data assimilation, vary with time, space, and treatments in global change experiments. This paper illustrates that varying parameters is to account for both processes at unresolved scales and changing properties of evolving systems. A model, no matter how complex it is, could not represent all the processes of one system at resolved scales. Interactions of processes at unresolved scales with those at resolved scales should be reflected in model parameters. Meanwhile, it is pervasively observed that properties of ecosystems change over time, space, and environmental conditions. Parameters, which represent properties of a system under study, should change as well. Tuning has been practiced for many decades to change parameter values. Yet this activity, unfortunately, did not contribute to our knowledge on model parameterization at all. Data assimilation makes it possible to rigorously estimate parameter values and, consequently, offers an approach to understand which, how, how much, and why parameters vary. To fully understand those issues, extensive research is required. Nonetheless, it is clear that changes in parameter values lead to different model predictions even if the model structure is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The determination of soil physical properties requires complex analyzes performed by software, which are mostly paid access programs. The advantage of using R software is that it is open access and offers several packages for the analysis of soil physic-hydrical properties data. The objective of this review is to present and to disseminate the tools available in R for studies in soil physics. We briefly describe some packages of the R software for soil physics and analyze their ease of reproduction. From the examples given in the manuals of each package we observed that their reproducibility was not always self-explanatory, as verified for the packages soilwater and SoilHyP. The HydroMe and soilphysics packages were the most comprehensible to be reproduced. The most common determination offered by these packages is related to soil water retention curve models. We hope this will guide the soil science researchers to employ, more often, R codes to analyze their data. The R scripts that were used to exemplify the packages reported in this paper are available at https://github.com/sousaetal/COMPAG_2019_600.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurate soil-moisture monitoring is essential for water-resource management and agricultural applications, and is now widely undertaken using satellite remote sensing or terrestrial hydrological models’ products. While both methods have limitations, e.g. the limited soil depth resolution of space-borne data and data deficiencies in models, data-assimilation techniques can provide an alternative approach. Here, we use the recently developed data-driven Kalman-Takens approach to integrate satellite soil-moisture products with those of the Australian Water Resources Assessment system Landscape (AWRA-L) model. This is done to constrain the model’s soil-moisture simulations over Australia with those observed from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System and Soil-Moisture and Ocean Salinity between 2002 and 2017. The main objective is to investigate the ability of the integration framework to improve AWRA-L simulations of soil moisture. The improved estimates are then used to investigate spatiotemporal soil-moisture variations. The results show that the proposed model-satellite data integration approach improves the continental soil-moisture estimates by increasing their correlation to independent in situ measurements (similar to 10% relative to the non-assimilation estimates).
HIGHLIGHTS
Satellite soil-moisture measurements are used to improve model simulation.
A data-driven approach based on Kalman-Takens is applied.

&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 degrees C during the test period (DL: 1.78 degrees C, PB: 2.03 degrees C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Peatlands play a key role in the global carbon cycle, sequestering and releasing large amounts of carbon. Despite their importance, a reliable method for the quantification of peatland thickness and volume is still missing, particularly for peat deposits located in the tropics given their limited accessibility, and for scales of measurement representative of peatland environments (i.e., of hundreds of km(2)). This limitation also prevents the accurate quantification of the stored carbon as well as future greenhouse gas emissions due to ongoing peat degradation. Here we present the results obtained using the airborne electromagnetic (AEM) method, a geophysical surveying tool, for peat thickness detection at the landscape scale. Based on a large amount of data collected on an Indonesian peatland, our results show that the AEM method provides a reliable and accurate 3-D model of peatlands, allowing the quantification of their volume and carbon storage. A comparison with the often used empirical topographic approach, which is based on an assumed correlation between peat thickness and surface topography, revealed larger errors across the landscape associated with the empirical approach than the AEM method when predicting the peat thickness. As a result, the AEM method provides higher estimates (22%) of organic carbon pools than the empirical method. We show how in our case study the empirical method tends to underestimate the peat thickness due to its inability to accurately detect the large variability in the elevation of the peat/mineral substrate interface, which is better quantified by the AEM method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A risk-based decision-making mechanism capable of accounting for uncertainty regarding local conditions is crucial to water resources management, regulation, and policy making. Despite the great potential of hydrogeological models in supporting water resources decisions, challenges remain due to the many sources of uncertainty as well as making and communicating decisions mindful of this uncertainty. This paper presents a framework that utilizes statistical hypothesis testing and an integrated approach to the planning of site characterization, modeling prediction, and decision making. Benefits of this framework include aggregated uncertainty quantification and risk evaluation, simplified communication of risk between stakeholders, and improved defensibility of decisions. The framework acknowledges that obtaining absolute certainty in decision making is impossible; rather, the framework provides a systematic way to make decisions in light of uncertainty and determine the amount of information required. In this manner, quantitative evaluation of a field campaign design is possible before data are collected, beginning from any knowledge state, which can be updated as more information becomes available. We discuss the limitations of this approach by the types of uncertainty that can be recognized and make suggestions for addressing the rest. This paper presents the framework in general and then demonstrates its application in a synthetic case study. Results indicate that the effectiveness of field campaigns depends not only on the environmental performance metric being predicted but also on the threshold value in decision-making processes. The findings also demonstrate that improved parameter estimation does not necessarily lead to better decision making, thus reemphasizing the need for goal-oriented characterization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of extreme climatic conditions leading to unusually low global agricultural production is exacerbated if more than one global ‘breadbasket’ is exposed at the same time. Such shocks can pose a risk to the global food system, amplifying threats to food security, and could potentially trigger other systemic risks(1,2). While the possibility of climatic extremes hitting more than one breadbasket has been postulated(3,4,) little is known about the actual risk. Here we combine region-specific data on agricultural production with spatial statistics of climatic extremes to quantify the changing risk of low production for the major food-producing regions (breadbaskets) over time. We show an increasing risk of simultaneous failure of wheat, maize and soybean crops across the breadbaskets analysed. For rice, risks of simultaneous adverse climate conditions have decreased in the recent past, mostly owing to solar radiation changes favouring rice growth. Depending on the correlation structure between the breadbaskets, spatial dependence between climatic extremes globally can mitigate or aggravate the risks for the global food production. Our analysis can provide the basis for more efficient allocation of resources to contingency plans and/or strategic crop reserves that would enhance the resilience of the global food system.
The risk of concurrent climate extremes affecting breadbasket regions is increasing with climate change, with wheat, maize and soybean crops at risk of simultaneous failure. Correlation between the regions and climate extremes should be considered to ensure food security in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A precise description of saturated (K-s) and near-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-10) and their spatial variability is important for understanding water/solute transport in the vadose zone. However, it is laborious to measure K directly. Alternatively, K could be predicted from easily measurable soil properties using pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Because PTFs ignore the spatial relationships and covariance between soil variables, they often perform unsatisfactorily when field-scale estimations of K are needed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to improve the estimation of K at field scale through consideration of spatial dependences between soil variables. K was measured at 48 locations in a 71 x 71-m grid within a farmland under no-till. An autoregressive state-space approach was used to quantify the spatial relations between K and soil properties and to analyze the spatial variability of K in the field. In comparison, multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to derive PTFs for K estimation. Using various combinations of variables, state-space analysis outperformed PTFs in estimating spatial K distribution across the field. While state-space approach explained 69%, MLR method explained only 6% of the total variation in K-s. For K-10, the best state-space model included silt, clay, and macroporosity and performed almost perfectly (R-2 &amp;gt;95%) in characterizing the spatial variability of K-10. In that case, the best MLR-type PTF explained only 60% of the variation. The results indicate that, by considering the spatial relations between soil variables, state-space approach is an effective tool for analyzing the spatial variability of K at field scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface runoff, erosion, compaction and the leaching of potential pollutants from land can degrade the soil resource and damage the water environment, reducing crop yields, causing loss of valuable nutrients and organic matter, together with increasing flood risk. Increasingly, it is recognized that scientific information must be translated into practical tools to change practices and protect the soil and water resource. Working alongside agencies in Scotland, we applied a suite of simple, transparent, rule-based models to identify areas most at risk of exporting sediment and pollutants that may degrade water quality based on field-scale (1:25,000) soil maps. The maps have been used by Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Water and Scottish Government to assess soil risks to waters from field to regional scale. The work brought scientists together with policy makers, agencies and the water industry to pool their knowledge to apply these practical tools for decision-making. It highlights the need to apply existing knowledge to answer salient questions. All three examples described show that providing the right type of information, which is based on fundamental soils data, can directly influence the implementation of policies, investment and monitoring decisions and provide evidence in support of government. However, this requires both researchers and agency scientists to develop skills as knowledge brokers and to normalize the use of soil data in everyday agency settings.&lt;/p&gt;

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is well known for its feature of remote detection. In this review, the development of remote detection based on LIBS is presented. Three kinds of remote LIBS configurations and their characteristics have been illustrated. Owing to an inferior efficiency and intensity of spectral signals collected in a remote distance, different methods have been studied to enhance signals. This review briefly summarized the advanced enhancement approaches for remote LIBS, which further improves the capabilities of LIBS for real-time and in situ measurement. Furthermore, the recent development and application of remote LIBS in a variety of fields have been presented. The potential of LIBS in remote detection and its existing problems have also been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is growing international interest in better managing soils to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) content to contribute to climate change mitigation, to enhance resilience to climate change and to underpin food security, through initiatives such as international ‘4p1000’ initiative and the FAO’s Global assessment of SOC sequestration potential (GSOCseq) programme. Since SOC content of soils cannot be easily measured, a key barrier to implementing programmes to increase SOC at large scale, is the need for credible and reliable measurement/monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) platforms, both for national reporting and for emissions trading. Without such platforms, investments could be considered risky. In this paper, we review methods and challenges of measuring SOC change directly in soils, before examining some recent novel developments that show promise for quantifying SOC. We describe how repeat soil surveys are used to estimate changes in SOC over time, and how long-term experiments and space-for-time substitution sites can serve as sources of knowledge and can be used to test models, and as potential benchmark sites in global frameworks to estimate SOC change. We briefly consider models that can be used to simulate and project change in SOC and examine the MRV platforms for SOC change already in use in various countries/regions. In the final section, we bring together the various components described in this review, to describe a new vision for a global framework for MRV of SOC change, to support national and international initiatives seeking to effect change in the way we manage our soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global network of long-term carbon and water flux measurements has existed since the late 1990s. With its representative sampling of the terrestrial biosphere’s climate and ecological spaces, this network is providing background information and direct measurements on how ecosystem metabolism responds to environmental and biological forcings and how they may be changing in a warmer world with more carbon dioxide. In this review, I explore how carbon and water fluxes of the world’s ecosystem are responding to a suite of covarying environmental factors, like sunlight, temperature, soil moisture, and carbon dioxide. I also report on how coupled carbon and water fluxes are modulated by biological and ecological factors such as phenology and a suite of structural and functional properties. And, I investigate whether long-term trends in carbon and water fluxes are emerging in various ecological and climate spaces and the degree to which they may be driven by physical and biological forcings. As a growing number of time series extend up to 20 years in duration, we are at the verge of capturing ecosystem scale trends in the breathing of a changing biosphere. Consequently, flux measurements need to continue to report on future conditions and responses and assess the efficacy of natural climate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how to manage N inputs to identify the practices that maximize N recovery has been an organizing principle of agronomic research. Because growth in N fertilizer inputs is expected to continue in an ongoing effort to boost crop production over coming decades, understanding how to efficiently manage recovery of fertilizer N will be important going forward. Yet synthesis of published data that has traced the fate of N-15-labeled fertilizer shows that less than half of the N taken up by crops is derived from current-year N fertilizer. The source of the majority of N in crops is something other than current-year fertilizer and the sources are not really known. This is true for maize (only 41% of N in crops was from current-year N fertilizer), rice (32%), and small grains (37%). Recovery of organic fertilizer N (manure, green manure, compost, etc.) in crops is low (27%), though N recovery in subsequent years (10%) was greater than that for mineral fertilizers. Thus, while research on efficiency of N fertilizer use through improved rate, type, location, and timing is important, this research fails to directly address management of the majority of the N supplied to crops. It seems likely that the majority of non-fertilizer N found in crops comes from turnover of soil and crop residue N. We encourage the research community to revisit the mental model that fertilizer is a replacement for N supply from turnover of soil organic N (SON) and consider a model in which N fertilizer augments ongoing SON turnover and makes an important longer term contribution to SON maintenance and turnover. Research focused on the efficient recovery of N current-year fertilizer inputs neglects this potential role for building soil N and managing soil N turnover, which seems likely to be the most important source of crop N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing soil organic matter (SOM) stocks to address global change challenges requires well-substantiated knowledge of SOM behavior that can be clearly communicated between scientists, management practitioners, and policy makers. However, SOM is incredibly complex and requires separation into multiple components with contrasting behavior in order to study and predict its dynamics. Numerous diverse SOM separation schemes are currently used, making cross-study comparisons difficult and hindering broad-scale generalizations. Here, we recommend separating SOM into particulate (POM) and mineral-associated (MAOM) forms, two SOM components that are fundamentally different in terms of their formation, persistence, and functioning. We provide evidence of their highly contrasting physical and chemical properties, mean residence times in soil, and responses to land use change, plant litter inputs, warming, CO2 enrichment, and N fertilization. Conceptualizing SOM into POM versus MAOM is a feasible, well-supported, and useful framework that will allow scientists to move beyond studies of bulk SOM, but also use a consistent separation scheme across studies. Ultimately, we propose the POM versus MAOM framework as the best way forward to understand and predict broad-scale SOM dynamics in the context of global change challenges and provide necessary recommendations to managers and policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With accumulation of carbon cycle observations and model developments over the past decades, exploring interannual variation (IAV) of terrestrial carbon cycle offers the opportunity to better understand climate-carbon cycle relationships. However, despite growing research interest, uncertainties remain on some fundamental issues, such as the contributions of different regions, constituent fluxes and climatic factors to carbon cycle IAV. Here we overviewed the literature on carbon cycle IAV about current understanding of these issues. Observations and models of the carbon cycle unanimously show the dominance of tropical land ecosystems to the signal of global carbon cycle IAV, where tropical semiarid ecosystems contribute as much as the combination of all other tropical ecosystems. Vegetation photosynthesis contributes more than ecosystem respiration to IAV of the global net land carbon flux, but large uncertainties remain on the contribution of fires and other disturbance fluxes. Climatic variations are the major drivers to the IAV of net land carbon flux. Although debate remains on whether the dominant driver is temperature or moisture variability, their interaction,that is, the dependence of carbon cycle sensitivity to temperature on moisture conditions, is emerging as key regulators of the carbon cycle IAV. On timescales from the interannual to the centennial, global carbon cycle variability will be increasingly contributed by northern land ecosystems and oceans. Therefore, both improving Earth system models (ESMs) with the progressive understanding on the fast processes manifested at interannual timescale and expanding carbon cycle observations at broader spatial and longer temporal scales are critical to better prediction on evolution of the carbon-climate system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among soil-centric options for addressing global issues being intensely debated by soil scientists, ecologists and earth scientists regarding their effectiveness and applicability are: (a) harnessing soil carbon (C) sink capacity for adaptation and mitigation of climate change; (b) reducing soil erosion as a source of greenhouse gases and the need to include it in the global C budget; (c) enhancing use efficiency of inputs to agroecosystems and returning land, water and other resources back to nature; (d) using global drylands, saline culture, halomorphic plants and brackish water for provisioning of ecosystem services; and (e) adopting a system-based conservation agriculture for eco-intensification of agroecosystems as a strategy of “producing more from less”. Not only should agriculture be made a solution for addressing global issues, but it is also essential to reconciling the need for advancing food and nutritional security with the absolute necessity of enhancing the environment, restoring degraded soils and desertified ecosystems, and advancing Sustainable Development Goals or the Agenda 2030. Highlights
Sustainable soil management, degraded soil restoration abridging agronomic yield gap and improving the environment are important to achieve world peace. Sustainable eco-intensification of agro-ecosystems reduces inputs and enhances use efficiency by restoring soil health. Harnessing soil carbon sink capacity includes reducing accelerated soil erosion for adaptation and mitigation of climate change. System-based conservation agriculture sustains agronomic productivity and minimizes soil degradation and environmental pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are now plenty of soil maps which digitally represent the soil variation across landscapes in both the lateral and vertical dimensions. Some might say this is akin to digital twinning for natural resources. These representations are usually provided as depth slices or layers for specified depth intervals. What is probably not as widely known or practiced is that one can use these data to generate custom soil maps (in terms of vertical support representation) according to the wishes of the end-user or map maker. In this post, the mass-preserving spline is re-introduced not for harmonising soil profile data, but for creating user-defined soil maps that exploit 3D digital soil mapping information that are becoming widely available publicly and for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-background-story-of-sorts&quot;&gt;A background story of sorts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There do not appear to be new official global activities associated with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isric.org/projects/globalsoilmapnet&quot;&gt;GlobalSoilMap.net&lt;/a&gt; project (Sanchez et al. 2009) any longer. This initiative was very active between 2009 and 2013 and created a flurry of efforts to map the world’s soils and their characteristics. The initial philosophy of GlobalSoilMap.net was for nodes to coordinate activities across a selected number of regions and individual countries would work within the nodes to develop digital soil mapping products for within country, and provide assistance to other countries in the region where the necessary digital soil mapping skill base was still in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the greatest success and lasting legacy of the GlobalSoilMap.net project was the creation of a document that specified the expected outputs to be developed i.e. the GlobalSoilMap.net specifications (Arrouays et al. 2014). These specifications have guided digital soil mapping practices throughout the world since they were published. Global soil mapping efforts now are coordinated a little differently and mainly through the auspices of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/en/&quot;&gt;Global Soil Parntership&lt;/a&gt;. One of the main GlobalSoilMap.net specifications was the requirement to produce maps for the following soil properties: SOC, clay, silt, sand and coarse fragment contents, pH, ECEC, soil depth and available depth to rooting, bulk density (whole soil and fine earth fraction), and available water capacity at standard depths to 2m. Specifically for the depth intervals of: 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm, 100-200cm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early research was dedicated to figuring out approaches for generating digital maps for the specified standard depths given legacy soil profile data and the existing digital soil mapping techniques. The mass preserving spline (Bishop, McBratney, and Laslett 1999) became a critical methodological advancement in this regard as it enabled soil profile data all with disparate depth information to be harmonised. The spline was fitted to the soil profile data and this depth function is then integrated to get the target soil property values for the standard depths or any specified depth intervals or set of depth intervals according to the user. The mass preserving spline is super useful and its mass preserving properties mean that the original soil profile information is never lost after the function is fitted. In a digital soil mapping context, first soil profile data is gathered, the splines are fitted individually to each profile from which the soil target variables at each standard depth is retrieved. Then spatial models are fitted for each depth using a collected suite of environmental covariate layers as predictor variables. This is the general approach undertaken in Malone et al. (2009) which has also been done too throughout the world. While this approach remains popular, different 3D spatial modelling approaches have evolved (see for example Hengl (2017), Orton, Pringle, and Bishop (2016), Viscarra Rossel et al. (2015), and Poggio and Gimona (2014)). But ultimately, the end result from whatever approach is used are digital soil maps of specific variables at each standard depth. The depth support of these maps is supposedly representing an average of the specified target variable for the given standard depth. This is the case for the Malone et al., Orton et al., Viscarra Rossel et al. and Poggio and Gimona approaches, but likely not for the Hengl et al. approach where the values are indicative of the mid-point between the upper and lower depths standard intervals. Technical differences aside, most maps are generated at a point support for a specified grid cell or pixel resolution which for the global soil mapping specifications was ~90m on the basis of the 3-sec STRM DEM which became readily available around the same time as the launching of GlobalSoilMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is now seemingly a proliferation of digital soil maps covering all parts of the world, all produced in a way that meet or closely adhere to the specifications set out in Arrouays et al. (2014). Australia is one of these places, and the efforts are described in Grundy et al. (2015). The great thing about this effort (The Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia; SLGA) is now these data are available for everyone to retrieve and importantly use for any number of purposes that requires spatial soil information. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/soilandlandscapegrid/GetData-DAP.html#&quot;&gt;This data is easy to access and download&lt;/a&gt;. If one is an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; user there is now even a package, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/slga/index.html&quot;&gt;slga&lt;/a&gt; that facilitates easy access and download of specified soil and environment data. We will get onto more of this package later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-opportunity&quot;&gt;An opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to make use of the available digital soil maps poses some follow up questions. It is great to be able to have a 3-D digital representation of soils, in some ways akin to a digital twin. But without necessary tools with which to analyse the representations of these data i.e. interrogating and integrating the 0-5cm,5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm, and 100-200cm layers, one will be limited in realising the utility of this information. One tool to be described in this post is the mass-preserving spline which we were just introduced to earlier in regards to harmonising soil profile data. Essentially the soil target variable data together with information about corresponding depths intervals are parameters of the spline. Therefore where there is layered and gridded digital soil maps we basically can fit a spline at each grid cell and then interrogate the fitted spline to generate new outputs at a different vertical support. This allows one to customise their soil mapping information to a form that is conducive for their own particular analysis. Furthermore a step forwards on this is that one can facilitate inferences as was exemplified in Malone et al. (2009) where variables such as depth to which carbon stocks breached a given threshold value, or estimated the water holding capacity to a given depth etc. One can even get more sophisticated around inference for such things as detecting depth to a texture contrast layer or to some given soil constraint. The important key point here is that the layered 3D representation of soil information as specified for GlobalSoilMap or for any other similar product, is that there is added utility of this information beyond the base maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post intends to exemplify the splines approach for 3D soil mapping products using the the SLGA data and associated R package as the vehicle for doing this. At the moment the code for doing this comes from a bespoke R function called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ea_ras_func&lt;/code&gt; and can be download from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rmrsfl6pk7p9gj/ea_ras_func.R?dl=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For all intents and purposes the function is the same as would be used to fit to soil profile data but is streamlined for grid data. Another key point is that as there are no gaps between sol values as the layers are adjacent to one another, there is no interpolation, meaning that the mass-preserving properties of the spline are much easier to adhere to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-get-on-with-it&quot;&gt;Let’s get on with it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a bit more background about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/slga/index.html&quot;&gt;slga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; package it is worth checking out the vignette that comes with the package that you can open once it is installed. This package is available from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/&quot;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;install.packages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;slga&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; packages required and the function for spline fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# The grid spline function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ea_ras_func.R&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# R libraries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;raster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next bits of code are for download of the SLGA maps. This is pretty much verbatim what is done in the slga &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; package vignette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Get surface clay content for King Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workhorse function in the code above is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get_soils_data&lt;/code&gt;. Here we are downloading from the national data repository space (as opposed to getting state-based estimates which may or may not be of improved prediction certainty) for each of the GSM standard depths. We are just downloading the values, but keep in mind that one can also get the associated prediction uncertainties too. Check out the help file for this function for other goodies one can do with it. Basically we are downloading each layer of data within the defined area of interest which in this case is King Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ea_rasSp&lt;/code&gt; function is relatively straightforward. Basically it will only ingests a raster stack. The function automatically assumes each raster layer represents a 3D soil representation, which could be GSM standard depths or some other representation. We specify this with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dIn&lt;/code&gt; parameter where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dIn = c(0,5,15,30,60,100,200)&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the GSM depths i.e. 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm and 100-200cm. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dOut&lt;/code&gt; is the parameter for the new depth intervals we want. Below we a signalling (just to be unusual) to get the 0-11cm, 11-25cm, 25-31cm, 21-50cm, and 50-180cm depth intervals. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vlow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vhigh&lt;/code&gt; parameters are for constraining the spline fit to be within normal ranges which for soil texture is between 0% and 100%. The other important parameter is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lam&lt;/code&gt; which determines the amount of flex in the fitted spline. The value 0.1 is usually a acceptable choice, but one can select their own choice based on there own criteria. High values result in stiff splines while low values result in flexible splines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-final-word&quot;&gt;A final word&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not too much more to this piece of work. The intention here was to illustrate that the outputs commonly generated in digital soil mapping that adhere the GSM specifications have much greater utility than just the standard depth intervals. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ea_rasSp&lt;/code&gt; is very much a beta version at this stage and could do with vectorisation and optimisation of compute. For now the workflow is a pixel-to-pixel routine. The actual spline fitting is super fast even without optimisation, but the sequential nature of pixel-to-pixel quickly ramps up the compute time for highly populated grids. Currently it would be useful for farm to regional extent soil mapping work as it is, but could indeed be parallelised for much larger extents without too much tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spline is a very useful tool for utilising such maps and enabling one to develop their own customised maps with relatively little effort. An example application of this would be the creation of digital soil maps where the new depth intervals correspond to measurement depths of a network of soil moisture sensors across a field or farm. Or estimating carbon stocks to 1m (a simple average may suffice in this case), or to some customised depths etc. I could be argued that the spline model be used on the soil profile data to generate information to custom depths, and them model. And this maybe the suggested route, but here we are working under the assumption that we don’t have this point data and only have the raster data, of course which is publicly available. In any case, the take home message is just don’t settle for what digital soil information is available to you. Instead, derive the information to suit your needs and your specifications!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global interest in soil health has increased exponentially during the past decade, with many different government, non-government, and private sector groups striving to develop monitoring and assessment protocols. This brief review focuses on developments in the United States (U.S.) with some references to activities in other countries. It also documents how the soil health concept evolved and projects what is needed to scientifically advance monitoring and assessment with a particular focus on activities in the U.S. Recommendations emphasize improving the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) and/or Comprehensive Assessment of Soil Health (CASH) assessment tools, developing protocols for national soil health monitoring, identifying and calibrating better indicators of soil biological, chemical, and physical health, and developing sensors and other tools for more rapid and in-situ assessments. Collectively, these and other research and technology transfer activities will help achieve what we suggest should be a universal goal - striving for healthy soils, healthy landscapes, and vibrant economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil spectral allocation or classification is usually conducted on air-dried soils. However, the field soils are not all air-dried, and the change of soil moisture will affect soil reflectance. We introduce a soil allocation model that considers the effect of soil moisture for the purpose of eliminating the effect of soil moisture. The topsoil spectral curves of four typical soils from the Songnen Plain in Northeast China were re-sampled to 10-nm intervals and converted to first-derivative spectral curves and continuum removal curves. The spectral feature parameters were extracted from continuum removal curves in the visible-near infrared (VNIR) range (350-2500 nm), and the range of 430-2400 nm was used to build soil allocation models for reducing the effect of noise. Samples with different soil moisture were mixed into air-dried soils and we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of different inputs to assess the effect of soil moisture and to find allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture. We used allocation indices of Zhang et al. (2018) because of the high accuracy of their DT (Decision Tree) model to allocate mixed-soil samples. We also used allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture to allocate mixed-soil samples with decision tree (DT), multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and multi-layer perception neural network (MLPNN), and compared the results of the two methods. The results show the following: 1) As SFPs were built with shorter bands, SFP was less sensitive to soil moisture than PCR and PCFD and thus SFP is more suitable to build soil allocation models that consider the effect of soil moisture as input than PCR and PCFD. 2) Differences in soil moisture had little effect on absorption valley shoulders, symmetry and absorption positions, moderate effect on absorption area and depth, and a major effect on the slope of different bands. 3) The effect of soil moisture on continuum removal curves of different soil classes was variable. There was little effect on Arenosols, a moderate effect on Chernozems and Cambisols, and a large effect on Phaeozems. 4) The accuracy of the DT model using allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture was 91.892% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.888. Our results suggest that it is feasible to build soil spectral allocation models that are not affected by soil moisture, and this improves the universality of soil spectral allocation, especially to field soils, which can be of considerable help in soil classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding evolution of soils and landforms (and other Earth surface systems) has itself evolved from concepts of single-path, single-outcome development to those that recognize multiple possible developmental trajectories and different maturely developed stales. Soil geomorphology and pedology should now move beyond showing that multiple trajectories are possible to investigating why some evolutionary pathways (EPs) are common and persistent, whereas others are rare and transient. A typology of EPs is developed and applied to soil formation in the North Carolina coastal plain. Some EN are impossible because of violation of generally applicable laws or absence of necessary conditions; others are currently impossible, having occurred in the past but requiring conditions that no longer exist. Improbable paths are possible but rare, because necessary circumstances involve rare events or boundary conditions. Inhibited EPs are also possible but rare because of resistance factors or feedbacks that prevent or inhibit them. Transient paths may be common but are not long-lived or well preserved and are thus rarely observed. Recurring but nonrepeating EPs occur in different locations but are irreversible in any given location and cannot recur except in the case of system-resetting disturbance or new inputs. Recurring EPs are riot inhibited or self-limited, occur in different locations, and may be repeated because of ongoing or recurrent processes or conditions. Selected path types occur in multiple situations, but with increased probability due to feedbacks or responses that encourage or enhance recurrence and/or persistence. The case study shows examples of all possible EP types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occurrence of extreme hot and dry conditions in warm seasons can have large impacts on human health, energy and water supplies, agriculture and wildfires. Australian hot and dry extremes have been known to be associated with the occurrence of El Nino and other variations of tropospheric circulation. Here we identify an additional driver: variability of the stratospheric Antarctic polar vortex. On the basis of statistical analyses using observational data covering the past 40 yr, we show that weakenings and warmings of the stratospheric polar vortex, which episodically occur during austral spring, substantially increase the chances of hot and dry extremes and of associated fire-conducive weather across subtropical eastern Australia from austral spring to early summer. The promotion of these Australian climate extremes results from the downward coupling of the weakened polar vortex to tropospheric levels, where it is linked to the low-index polarity of the Southern Annular Mode, an equatorward shift of the mid-latitude westerly jet stream and subsidence and warming in the subtropics. Because of the long timescale of the polar vortex variations, the enhanced likelihood of early-summertime hot and dry extremes and wildfire risks across eastern Australia may be predictable a season in advance during years of vortex weakenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In boundary line analysis a biological response (e.g., crop yield) is assumed to be a function of a variable (e.g., soil nutrient concentration), which limits the response in only some subset of observations because other limiting factors also apply. The response function is therefore expressed by an upper boundary of the plot of the response against the variable. This model has been used in various branches of soil science. In this paper we apply it to the analysis of some large datasets, originating from commercial farms in England and Wales, on the recorded yield of wheat and measured concentrations of soil nutrients in within-field soil management zones. We considered boundary line models for the effects of potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) on yield, comparing the model with a simple bivariate normal distribution or a bivariate normal censored at a constant maximum yield. We were able to show, using likelihood-based methods, that the boundary line model was preferable in most cases. The boundary line model suggested that the standard RB209 soil nutrient index values (Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, nutrient management guide (RB209), 2017) are robust and apply at the within-field scale. However, there was evidence that wheat yield could respond to additional Mg at concentrations above index 0, contrary to RB209 guidelines. Furthermore, there was evidence that the boundary line model for yield and P differs between soils at different pH and depth intervals, suggesting that shallow soils with larger pH require a larger target P index than others. Highlights
Boundary line analysis is one way to examine how soil variables influence crop yield in large datasets. We showed that boundary line models could be applied to large datasets on soil nutrients and crop yield. The resulting models are consistent with current practice for P and K, but not for Mg. Models suggest that more refined recommendations for P requirement could be based on soil pH and depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The categorical and qualitative nature of currently available soil structural data along with the lack of a geographically broad dataset have impeded progress in understanding the development of soil structure. In this study, we assembled a soil, climate, and ecological dataset for the USA, and used it to analyze relationships between soil structure (ped type, shape, size, and grade) and exogenous and endogenous variables influencing the development of soil structure. We analyzed a subset of the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) Soil Characterization database after merging this information with climatological and ecological data. The merged and cleaned dataset contains &amp;gt; 4400 observations from approximately 1600 pedons. We found that climate, as an exogenous factor was the most important predictor of ped shape and size. Cold and/or dry climates promoted the development of larger anisotropic peds with rougher surfaces whereas warmer and more humid climates promoted the development of finer equidimensional peds with smoother surfaces. Based on these findings, we argue that climate promotes the development of soil structure along either fragmentation or aggregation pathways. The former pathway is characterized by largely mechanical processes in cold and dry environments, whereas aggregation is promoted by predominately biological and chemical mechanisms found in warmer and wet environments. This connection between climate and the development of soil structure represents a potentially important effect of climate on a morphological property strongly linked to soil hydrology that warrants further investigation with continental-scale soil data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land cover maps play an integral role in environmental management. However, countries and institutes encounter many challenges with producing timely, efficient, and temporally harmonized updates to their land cover maps. To address these issues we present a modular Regional Land Cover Monitoring System (RLCMS) architecture that is easily customized to create land cover products using primitive map layers. Primitive map layers are a suite of biophysical and end member maps, with land cover primitives representing the raw information needed to make decisions in a dichotomous key for land cover classification. We present best practices to create and assemble primitives from optical satellite using computing technologies, decision tree logic and Monte Carlo simulations to integrate their uncertainties. The concept is presented in the context of a regional land cover map based on a shared regional typology with 18 land cover classes agreed on by stakeholders from Cambodia, Laos PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. We created annual map and uncertainty layers for the period 2000-2017. We found an overall accuracy of 94% when taking uncertainties into account. RLCMS produces consistent time series products using free long term historical Landsat and MODIS data. The customizable architecture can include a variety of sensors and machine learning algorithms to create primitives and the best suited smoothing can be applied on a primitive level. The system is transferable to all regions around the globe because of its use of publicly available global data (Landsat and MODIS) and easily adaptable architecture that allows for the incorporation of a customizable assembly logic to map different land cover typologies based on the user’s landscape monitoring objectives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the soil catena was first explicitly formalised by Geoffrey Milne and his colleagues in East Africa in the 1930s. It has been widely adopted and applied in soil survey and continues to be of great value in soil and other field sciences The concept characterises widespread patterns in which distinctive associations of soils and vegetation are consistently located in specific slope positions. The formalisation of the concept in an area well outside the mainstream of soil research appears to have been due to the combination of highly visible recurrent patterns of red slope soils overlooking dark valley clays in East Africa’s extensive savannahs, together with a group of receptive and collaborative soil scientists working in a supportive institutional environment. The concept is often attributed to Geoffrey Milne, the group’s coordinator, but we show that several colleagues and friends also contributed. We summarise some of the early soil catenas characterised by Milne and his colleagues in Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika Territory (now Tanzania). Even at the beginning, it was appreciated that the catena was not universally applicable and that heterogeneity of parent materials can override catenary patterns. The catena was quickly and widely adopted in soil science, and this diffusion has led to some broadening of the definition, and several types of soil pattern are now designated as catenas. The concept has also spread beyond soil science and is used by ecologists, geomorphologists and hydrologists amongst others. It continues to be a paradigm of great explicative and educational power in soil science and ecology.&lt;/p&gt;

The information derived from this process is often translated into pedological knowledge. This mechanism is referred to as knowledge discovery. This study shows that knowledge discovery based on ML must be treated with caution. We show how pseudo-covariates can be used to accurately predict soil organic carbon in a hypothetical case study. We demonstrate that ML methods can find relevant patterns even when the covariates are meaningless and not related to soil-forming factors and processes. We argue that pattern recognition for prediction should not be equated with knowledge discovery. Knowledge discovery requires more than the recognition of patterns and successful prediction. It requires the pre-selection and preprocessing of pedologically relevant environmental covariates and the posterior interpretation and evaluation of the recognized patterns. We argue that important ML covariates could serve the purpose of providing elements to postulate hypotheses about soil processes that, once validated through experiments, could result in new pedological knowledge.

&lt;p&gt;We explored soil properties as indices of mineralisable nitrogen (N) in sugarcane soils and whether we could increase the accuracy of predicting N mineralisation during laboratory incubations. Utilising historical data in combination with samples collected during 2016, we: (i) measured mineralised N over the course of short-term (14 days) and long-term (301 days) laboratory incubations; (ii) compared models representing mineralisation; then (iii) related model parameters to measured soil properties. We found measures representing the labile organic N pool (Hydrolysable NaOH organic N; amino sugar Illinois soil N test) best related to short-term mineralised N (R-2 of 0.50-0.57, P &amp;lt; 0.001), while measures of CO2 production (3, 7, 10 and 14 days) best related to longer-term mineralised N (R-2 of 0.75-0.84, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Indices were brought together to model the active and slow pools of a two-pool mineralisation model in the statistical framework of a mixed-effects model. Of the models that relied on measurement of one soil property, cumulative CO2 production (7 days) performed the best when considering all soil types; in a cross-validation test, this model gave an external R-2 of 0.77 for prediction of the 301-day mineralised N. Since the mixed-effects model accounts for the various sources of uncertainty, we suggest this approach as a framework for prediction of in-field available N, with further measurement of long-term mineralised N in other soils to strengthen predictive certainty of these soil indices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversion of soils supporting native vegetation to agricultural production has led to a loss of soil carbon stocks. Replacing a portion of the lost stocks will sequester atmospheric carbon with the concurrent benefit of enhancing soil sustainability. The ability of the fine fraction of soils (&amp;lt;= 50-mu m fraction) to adsorb organic carbon (OC) is considered a key mechanism capable of stabilising soil OC against loss. The difference between the current and maximum concentrations of OC in the soil fine fraction (FFC) has been termed the ‘saturation deficit’ (SatDef) and used to define the potential for a soil to sequester carbon. For New Zealand surface 0-15 cm soil layers, pedotransfer functions have been derived to quantify the soil carbon SatDef. The ability of combining infrared spectroscopy (IR) with partial least squares regression (PLSR) to derive predictive algorithms for soil properties included in these pedotransfer functions, the capacity of the soil fine fraction to stabilise carbon and the SatDef of the soil fine fraction were assessed in this study. A total of 168 air-dried and finely ground New Zealand surface soils representative of the major soil orders used for agricultural production were included. Principal components analysis of IR spectra showed a grouping by soil order that was related to mineralogy. Predictive IR/PLSR algorithms were derived for specific surface area, pyrophosphate-extractable aluminium, the FFC content, the 90th quantile regression of FFC and the SatDef of the fine fraction (R-2 values &amp;gt;= 0.85; ratio of performance to interquartile range values &amp;gt;= 2.9). The results indicate that IR/PLSR provides a rapid and cost-effective mechanism for deriving information related to the amount of FFC in soils and the SatDef of the fine fraction. The IR/PLSR approach could be used to define the potential of soils to sequester carbon and identify the soil types to target for carbon sequestration technologies. The approach would also generate valuable data for soil carbon in national inventories or national soil condition monitoring programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change will lead to altered soil conditions that will impact on plant growth in both agricultural and native ecosystems. Additionally, changes in soil carbon storage will influence carbon accounting schemes that may play a role in climate change mitigation programs. We applied a digital soil mapping approach to examine and map (at 100-m resolution) potential changes in three important soil properties - soil organic carbon (SOC), pH and sum-of-bases (common macro-nutrients) - resulting from projected climate change over south-eastern Australia until similar to 2070. Four global climate models were downscaled with three regional models to give 12 climate models, which were used to derive changes for the three properties across the province, at 0-30 and 30-100 cm depth intervals. The SOC stocks were projected to decline over the province, while pH and sum-of-bases were projected to increase; however, the extent of change varied throughout the province and with different climate models. The average changes primarily reflected the complex interplay of changing temperatures and rainfall throughout the province. The changes were also influenced by the operating environmental conditions, with a uniform pattern of change particularly demonstrated for SOC over 36 combinations of current climate, parent material and land use. For example, the mean decline of SOC predicted for the upper depth interval was 15.6 Mg ha(-1) for wet-mafic-native vegetation regimes but only 3.1 Mg ha(-1) for dry-highly siliceous-cropping regimes. The predicted changes reflected only those attributable to the projected climate change and did not consider the influence of ongoing and changing land management practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current agri-ecological systems face the twin challenge of providing sufficient food for a growing global population and of mitigating severe negative environmental impacts from agricultural land-use in terms of biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient run-off, soil degradation, and water pollution. Disciplinary research provides detailed answers to specific questions related to the challenges faced by agri-ecological systems. However, it fails to consider the complex interrelationships and dynamics of the different economic, natural and governance subsystems of which agri-ecological systems consist and that need to be considered to address these challenges. In principle, it is possible to develop models that integrate knowledge from the fields of ecology, economics and governance, and consider dynamic system features such as feedbacks between subsystems as well as tipping points. In this viewpoint article, we scrutinize selected integrated agri-ecological system models and find that only very few models address the challenges mentioned above. We suggest further research in three areas: (I) in-depth integration of the governance subsystem in integrated models, (II) more comprehensive inclusion of tipping points in integrated models, and (III) integration of cascading effects where one system change stimulates another system change. Finally, we briefly discuss the challenges of complex integrated modeling in relation to computational power and the necessity to gather expertise from different disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first pass workflow for placing cover sequence materials into four broad lithological groups using A-CNK-FM (Al2O3-CaO + Na2O + K2O-Fe2O3+MgO) and A-CN-K (Al2O3-CaO + Na2O-K2O) ternary diagrams in conjunction with the SiO2 vs Al2O3, Fe2O3 and CaO plus the Ca versus Sr XY diagrams has been derived from lithological logging and laboratory whole-rock geochemistry of 2346 samples. These lithological groups include siliciclastics (quartz sands and clays), weathered material, carbonate lithologies (marine limestone, pedogenic carbonate and compositions intermediate between the two end members) and ferruginous lithologies (including ferricrete and ferruginous sediments). Depositional, weathering and groundwater processes influence sample geochemistry during or after the formation of the material and will influence where the sample will plot on the geochemical diagrams used in this study. Geochemical data for discrete lithologies targeted during sampling (e.g. carbonate lithologies) clusters on diagrams used in the geochemical workflow, whereas data from targeted stratigraphic horizons (e.g. basement-cover interface) are more variable. The ability to characterise rock types that are texturally defined using the geochemical workflow is limited. For instance, the geochemistry of diamictite/conglomerate samples is dependent on the matrix versus clast content and composition as well as the source rock and catchment area. This workflow has the potential to be applied in a mineral exploration environment for rapid interpretation of real-time geochemical (e.g. portable XRF) data to gain an understanding of background geochemistry and geochemical signatures that may be related to underlying mineralisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atterberg limits (shrinkage limit [SL], plastic limit [PL], and liquid limit [LL]) describe the physico-mechanical behavior of soils and thus are crucial for civil and agricultural applications. Conventional laboratory methods for measurement of these limits are tedious and costly for a large number of samples. Our objective was to develop visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS, from 400-2500 nm) based reliable models to estimate the Atterberg limits. Two conventional methods for each Atterberg limit were used to generate the reference data: paraffin wax and Hg methods for SL; rolling and motorized devices for PL; and Casagrande cup and drop-cone penetrometer methods for LL. Calibration models were built on 80% of the data using partial least squares regression and validated with the remaining 20% of the dataset. The Vis-NIRS independent validation of LL showed very good estimation with standardized RMSE (SRMSE = RMSE/Range) of 0.16 and 0.15, respectively, for LLdrop-cone and LLCasagrande methods. Similarly for PL, the Vis-NIRS estimation accuracy was quite good with SRMSE values of 0.18 and 0.22, respectively, for PLmotorized and PLrolling. Reasonably good estimation was obtained for the SLparaffin and SLHg with SRMSE of 0.25 for both methods. The results suggest that the Vis-NIRS calibration models and the accuracy following validation were similar for the pair of methods used for the SL, PL, and LL. Finally, analyses of the model regression coefficients revealed that the important wavelengths to estimate the SL, PL, and LL in the Vis-NIR regions were present across the entire Vis-NIR spectrum and were strongly related to clay type and content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Fire activity has a huge impact on human lives. Different models have been proposed to predict fire activity, which can be classified into global and regional ones. Global fire models focus on longer timescale simulations and can be very complex. Regional fire models concentrate on seasonal forecasting but usually require inputs that are not available in many places. Motivated by the possibility of having a simple, fast, and general model, we propose a seasonal fire prediction methodology based on time series forecasting methods. It consists of dividing the studied area into grid cells and extracting time series of fire counts to fit the forecasting models. We apply these models to estimate the fire season severity (FSS) from each cell, here defined as the sum of the fire counts detected in a season. Experimental results using a global fire detection data set show that the proposed approach can predict FSS with a relatively low error in many regions. The proposed approach is reasonably fast and can be applied on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing influence of climatic and land-use pressures on soils across broad geographic extents have revealed a need for generalizable indices of soil development applicable at continental scales. In this study, we present generalizable horizon and profile development indices (HDIs and PDIs, respectively) based primarily on relative horizon properties instead of parent material information and provide an evaluation of these indices at a continental scale. The indices developed in this work combine knowledge of pedogenic processes with selected properties from a large database of predominantly US soils to yield relevant soil morphological, physical, and chemical information on 57,171 horizons arising from 8980 pedons. We selected four properties from which the generalizable HDI and PDI calculations were based: particle size, calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), color, and clay films. Modified z-scores were used to assess relative changes between either eluvial and illuvial horizons for particle size and CCE or surface and subsurface horizons for color. These values were then normalized using maximum and minimum values observed in the dataset. Normalized clay film scores were calculated using percent cover along with ordinal values assigned to distinctness categories described in the field. The index values from HDI compared well to both diagnostic horizon designations and chemical index of alteration and PDI values matched the sequence of taxonomic soil orders that represent a development gradient. In addition, we observed a correspondence between calculated PDIs and a clay mineralogy index representing weathering intensity. Relationships between these generalizable indices, evaluation metrics, and climate (i.e., MAP) explored in this work opens the door to numerous broad-scale applications in the future such as pedogenic modeling, identification of soil anomalies, and estimation of surface soil ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the difficulty to reach high suction at the residual state of unsaturated soils, the saturation-suction experimental data for soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) is often limited and incomplete, which will lead to unreliable estimation of mechanical and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils. However, no study has been published on how to obtain a reliable SWCC for unsaturated soils with limited experimental data. In response to this situation, an innovative method was proposed based on the analysis of shape characteristics of SWCC with three identified critical points in it. 78 experimental datasets from existing literature were compiled to identify the mathematical relationship among three critical points in the SWCC. The proposed method was evaluated by experimental datasets from this study and existing literature and proved to have a satisfying performance in predicting a complete SWCC for a wide range of soils, from the coarse-grained to the fine-grained. Overall, the research results present an effective and capable method for estimating a more reliable SWCC when experimental data is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drought indices based on thermal remote sensing have been developed and have merit for effective early warning of agricultural droughts, but approaches so far are relatively complex or sensitive to land surface temperature (LST) estimation uncertainties. Here, we propose the temperature rise index (TRI), a drought index that is comparatively robust and easy to calculate, as the anomaly of the intrinsic morning rise of LST. The underlying principle is that the rate of LST rise between 1.5 and 3.5 h after the sunrise is approximately linear and occurs more rapidly under dry conditions than under wet conditions over vegetated surfaces as a consequence of stomatal control. TRI during the growing seasons of 2010-2014 was calculated over the Australian wheatbelt from LST retrievals from the geostationary Multifunction Transport Satellite-2 (MTSAT-2) instrument. The calculated TRI was compared with indices based on precipitation integrated over 1-, 3- and 6-month time scales, on Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture derived from passive microwave remote sensing, and on vegetation condition (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) derived from optical remote sensing. The various indices were also compared to annual wheat yield over large areas. The correlation coefficient between TRI and precipitation anomaly that serves as an operational drought index in Australia was above 0.6 in general with 3-month integrative time scale for precipitation. TRI produced spatiotemporal dryness patterns that were very similar to those in soil moisture, but with more detail due to its finer resolution. A time lag of &amp;gt; 1 month was found between TRI and observed vegetation condition, supporting the use of TRI in early warning. Among the compared drought indices, TRI explained the largest fraction (35%) of wheat yield variations. TRI correlations with wheat yields peaked higher and earlier by almost one month in comparison to other indices. We conclude that the thermal drought index proposed here shows considerable potential for use in drought early warning as an effective complement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remotely sensed Earth observations (EO) have their history firmly rooted in agricultural monitoring, and more recently with applications in food production, food security, and sustainable agriculture. Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth’s land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17). We further characterize the applicability and use of EO data products and tools as they correspond with the United Nations Interagency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) Global Indicator Framework. This inventory will be complemented by a discussion of the intersection of other policy mandates with the SDGs in the agriculture and food security contexts, and will conclude with a discussion of approaches to improving awareness of EO value and bridging the gap between policy and EO communities, to the societal benefit of all with no one left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture provides humanity with food, fibers, fuel, and raw materials that are paramount for human livelihood. Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we set up a new drone-borne ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for soil moisture mapping. The whole radar system weighs 1.5 kg and consists of a handheld vector network analyzer (VNA) working as frequency domain radar, a lightweight hybrid horn-dipole antenna covering a wide frequency range (250-2800 MHz), a GPS for positioning, a microcomputer with the controlling application, and a smartphone for remote control. Soil moisture is derived from the radar data using full-wave inverse modeling based on the radar equation of Lambot et al. and multilayered media Green’s functions. The inversion is performed in the time domain and focuses on the surface reflection. The antenna-drone system is characterized by global reflection and transmission functions which are determined through a calibration procedure. We performed drone-GPR measurements over three different agricultural fields in the loess belt region of Belgium. In this study, we used the 500-700 MHz range to avoid soil surface roughness effects and to focus on the top 10-20 cm of the soil. These fields present a range of landform conditions leading to specific soil moisture distributions. The soil moisture maps were constructed from the local measurements using kriging. The obtained soil moisture maps are in good agreement with the topographical conditions of the fields and aerial orthophotography observations. These results demonstrated the potential and benefits of drone-GPR for fast, high-resolution mapping of soil moisture at the field scale, and to support, e.g., precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface soil moisture (SSM) has been identified as a key climate variable governing hydrologic and atmospheric processes across multiple spatial scales at local, regional, and global levels. The global burgeoning of SSM datasets in the past decade holds a significant potential in improving our understanding of multiscale SSM dynamics. The primary issues that hinder the fusion of SSM data from disparate instruments are (1) different spatial resolutions of the data instruments, (2) inherent spatial variability in SSM caused due to atmospheric and land surface controls, and (3) measurement errors caused due to imperfect retrievals of instruments. We present a data fusion scheme which takes all the above three factors into account using a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model (SHM), combining a geostatistical approach with a hierarchical model. The applicability of the fusion scheme is demonstrated by fusing point, airborne, and satellite data for a watershed exhibiting high spatial variability in Manitoba, Canada. We demonstrate that the proposed data fusion scheme is adept at assimilating and predicting SSM distribution across all three scales while accounting for potential measurement errors caused due to imperfect retrievals. Further validation of the algorithm is required in different hydroclimates and surface heterogeneity as well as for other data platforms for wider applicability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective land-based solutions to climate change mitigation require actions that maximize soil carbon storage without generating surplus nitrogen. Land management for carbon sequestration is most often informed by bulk soil carbon inventories, without considering the form in which carbon is stored, its capacity, persistency and nitrogen demand. Here, we present coupling of European-wide databases with soil organic matter physical fractionation to determine continental-scale forest and grassland topsoil carbon and nitrogen stocks and their distribution between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter pools. Grasslands and arbuscular mycorrhizal forests store more soil carbon in mineral-associated organic carbon, which is more persistent but has a higher nitrogen demand and saturates. Ectomycorrhizal forests store more carbon in particulate organic matter, which is more vulnerable to disturbance but has a lower nitrogen demand and can potentially accumulate indefinitely. The share of carbon between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter and the ratio between carbon and nitrogen affect soil carbon stocks and mediate the effects of other variables on soil carbon stocks. Understanding the physical distribution of organic matter in pools of mineral-associated versus particulate organic matter can inform land management for nitrogen-efficient carbon sequestration, which should be driven by the inherent soil carbon capacity and nitrogen availability in ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear need for transformative change in the land management and food production sectors to address the global land challenges of climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, combatting land degradation and desertification, and delivering food security (referred to hereafter as “land challenges”). We assess the potential for 40 practices to address these land challenges and find that: Nine options deliver medium to large benefits for all four land challenges. A further two options have no global estimates for adaptation, but have medium to large benefits for all other land challenges. Five options have large mitigation potential (&amp;gt;3 Gt CO(2)eq/year) without adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Five options have moderate mitigation potential, with no adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Sixteen practices have large adaptation potential (&amp;gt;25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects on other land challenges. Most practices can be applied without competing for available land. However, seven options could result in competition for land. A large number of practices do not require dedicated land, including several land management options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied at a large scale, though the impact is scale and context specific, highlighting the need for safeguards to ensure that expansion of land for mitigation does not impact natural systems and food security. A number of practices, such as increased food productivity, dietary change and reduced food loss and waste, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing-up land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other practices, making them important components of portfolios of practices to address the combined land challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding how to manage N inputs to identify the practices that maximize N recovery has been an organizing principle of agronomic research. Because growth in N fertilizer inputs is expected to continue in an ongoing effort to boost crop production over coming decades, understanding how to efficiently manage recovery of fertilizer N will be important going forward. Yet synthesis of published data that has traced the fate of N-15-labeled fertilizer shows that less than half of the N taken up by crops is derived from current-year N fertilizer. The source of the majority of N in crops is something other than current-year fertilizer and the sources are not really known. This is true for maize (only 41% of N in crops was from current-year N fertilizer), rice (32%), and small grains (37%). Recovery of organic fertilizer N (manure, green manure, compost, etc.) in crops is low (27%), though N recovery in subsequent years (10%) was greater than that for mineral fertilizers. Thus, while research on efficiency of N fertilizer use through improved rate, type, location, and timing is important, this research fails to directly address management of the majority of the N supplied to crops. It seems likely that the majority of non-fertilizer N found in crops comes from turnover of soil and crop residue N. We encourage the research community to revisit the mental model that fertilizer is a replacement for N supply from turnover of soil organic N (SON) and consider a model in which N fertilizer augments ongoing SON turnover and makes an important longer term contribution to SON maintenance and turnover. Research focused on the efficient recovery of N current-year fertilizer inputs neglects this potential role for building soil N and managing soil N turnover, which seems likely to be the most important source of crop N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Most cropping systems around the world are organised around few dominant crops and a larger number of less frequent crops. While rare and infrequent crops occupy a small share of the cropped area, they produce ecological benefits on farmland, contribute to sustainability and help provide food and nutritional security. However, data about their location and extent derived from satellite imagery generally lack accuracy, largely owing to the class imbalance problem. Class imbalance occurs when only few instances of some classes are available for training classifiers, and leads to large error rates of the infrequent classes. In this study, we assessed the magnitude of the class imbalance problem in crop classification and evaluated balancing methods to combat it by creating synthetic minority observations or by removing majority observations. To that aim, we generated 18 unbalanced data sets from Sentinel-2 time series and crop type observations in Victoria, Australia. These data sets covered a wide range of complexity, number of classes, number of samples per class and spectral separability which enabled us to gather evidence about the benefits and drawbacks of balancing methods in various settings. Classification accuracy was assessed with two metrics: the Overall Accuracy (OA), which gives more weight to majority classes, and the G-Mean accuracy (GM), which is more sensitive to minority classes. Results showed that class imbalance explained near 40% of the accuracy variability. We found that balancing methods boosted GM by 0.01-0.54 but no single best solution emerged. The price for increasing the accuracy of minority classes was a drop in OA of a magnitude that was problem- and method-specific. We thus applied an algorithm selection method called the F-race to identify optimal balancing methods in a computationally economic fashion. Optimal balancing methods lead to maximum gain in GM and minimum loss in OA. We demonstrated that this approach either successfully identified optimal balancing methods or ones that were not significantly sub-optimal, while reducing the computational cost by up to 60%. It can readily be incorporated to operational crop classification systems with little disruption to the existing processing chains. This contribution paves the way for achieving a more comprehensive and detailed view of crop distribution and cropping sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Surface soil moisture (SSM), as a vital variable for water and heat exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere, is essential for agricultural production and drought monitoring, and serves as an important boundary condition for atmospheric models. The spatial resolution of soil moisture products from microwave remote sensing is relatively coarse (e.g., similar to 40 km x 40 km), whereas SSM of higher spatiotemporal resolutions (e.g., 1 km x 1 km and daily continuous) is more useful in water resources management. In this study, first, to improve the spatiotemporal completeness of SSM estimates, we downscaled land surface temperature (LST) output from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) using a data fusion approach and MODIS LST acquired on clear-sky days to generate spatially complete and temporally continuous LST maps across the North China Plain. Second, spatially complete and daily continuous 1 km x 1 km SSM was generated based on random forest models combined with quality LST maps, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface albedo, precipitation, soil texture, SSM background fields from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative (CCI, 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) and CLDAS land surface model (LSM) SSM output (0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) to be downscaled, and in situ SSM measurements. Third, the importance of different input variables to the downscaled SSM was quantified. Compared with the original CCI and CLDAS SSM, both the accuracy and spatial resolution of the downscaled SSM were largely improved, in terms of a bias (root mean square error) of -0.001 cm(3)/cm(3) (0.041 cm(3)/cm(3)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.72. These results are generally comparable and even better than those in published studies, with our SSM maps featuring spatiotemporal completeness and relatively high spatial resolution. The downscaled SSM maps are valuable for monitoring agricultural drought and optimizing irrigation scheduling, bridging the gaps between microwave-based and LSM-based SSM estimates of coarse spatial resolution and thermal infrared-based LST at a 1 km x 1 km resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission of NASA was launched in January 2015. Currently, SMAP has an L-band radiometer and a defunct L-band radar with a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna. On July 7th, 2015, the SMAP radar malfunctioned and became inoperable. Consequently, the production of high-resolution active-passive soil moisture product got hampered, and only similar to 2.5 months (April 15th, 2015 to July 7th, 2015) of data remain available. Therefore, during the SMAP post-radar phase, many ways were examined to restart the high-resolution soil moisture product generation of the SMAP mission. One of the feasible approaches was to substitute the SMAP radar with other available SAR data. Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B SAR data was found most suitable for combining with the SMAP radiometer data because of its nearly similar orbit configuration that allows overlapping of their swaths with a minimal time difference, a key feature/requirement for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. The Sentinel interferometric wide swath (IW) mode acquisition also provides the co-polarized and cross-polarized observations required for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. However, some differences do exist between the SMAP and Sentinel SAR data. They are mainly: 1) Sentinel has a C-band SAR whereas SMAP operates at L-band; 2) Sentinel has multiple incidence angles within its swath, and SMAP has one single incidence angle; and 3) Sentinel 1A/B Interferometric Wide (IW) swath width is similar to 250 km as compared to SMAP with 1000 km swath width. On any given day, the narrow swath width of the Sentinel observations significantly reduces the overlap spatial coverage between SMAP and Sentinel as compared to the original SMAP radar and radiometer swath coverage. Hence, the temporal resolution (revisit interval) suffers due to narrow overlapped swath width and degrades from 3 days to 12 days. One advantage of using very high-resolution resolution Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B data in the SMAP active-passive algorithm is the potential of obtaining the disaggregated brightness temperature and thus soil moisture at a much finer spatial resolution of 3 km and 1 km at global extent. The assessment of high-resolution product at 3 km and 1 km using the soil moisture calibration and validations sites shows reasonable accuracy of similar to 0.05 m(3)/m(3). The SMAP-Sentinel1 active-passive high-resolution product is now available to the public (new version released in October 2018) through NSIDC (NASA DAAC). The duration of this product is from April 2015 to current date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50?years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
With accumulation of carbon cycle observations and model developments over the past decades, exploring interannual variation (IAV) of terrestrial carbon cycle offers the opportunity to better understand climate-carbon cycle relationships. However, despite growing research interest, uncertainties remain on some fundamental issues, such as the contributions of different regions, constituent fluxes and climatic factors to carbon cycle IAV. Here we overviewed the literature on carbon cycle IAV about current understanding of these issues. Observations and models of the carbon cycle unanimously show the dominance of tropical land ecosystems to the signal of global carbon cycle IAV, where tropical semiarid ecosystems contribute as much as the combination of all other tropical ecosystems. Vegetation photosynthesis contributes more than ecosystem respiration to IAV of the global net land carbon flux, but large uncertainties remain on the contribution of fires and other disturbance fluxes. Climatic variations are the major drivers to the IAV of net land carbon flux. Although debate remains on whether the dominant driver is temperature or moisture variability, their interaction,that is, the dependence of carbon cycle sensitivity to temperature on moisture conditions, is emerging as key regulators of the carbon cycle IAV. On timescales from the interannual to the centennial, global carbon cycle variability will be increasingly contributed by northern land ecosystems and oceans. Therefore, both improving Earth system models (ESMs) with the progressive understanding on the fast processes manifested at interannual timescale and expanding carbon cycle observations at broader spatial and longer temporal scales are critical to better prediction on evolution of the carbon-climate system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Dynamics of coupled Social-Ecological Systems (SES) result from the interplay of society and ecology. To assess SES resilience, we constructed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a land use system as a stereotypical example of SES and investigated how resilience of the represented system is affected by both external disturbances and internal dynamics. The model explicitly considered different aspects of resilience in a framework derived from literature, which includes “resilience to”, “resilience of”, “resilience at”, “resilience due to”, and “indicators of resilience”. External disturbances were implemented as shocks in crop yields. Internal dynamics comprised of two types of social interaction between agents (learning and cooperation), an ecological feedback of soil depletion and an economic feedback of agglomeration benefits. We systematically varied these mechanisms and measured indicators that reflected spatial, social, and economic resilience. Results showed that (1) internal mechanisms increased the ability of the system to recover from external shocks, (2) feedbacks resulted in different regimes of crop cultivation, each with a distinctive set of functions, and (3) resilience is not a generic system property, but strongly depends on what system function is considered. We recommend future studies to include internal dynamics, especially feedbacks, and to systematically assess them across different aspects of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Anthropogenic pressures increasingly alter natural systems. Therefore, understanding the resilience of agent-based complex systems such as ecosystems, i.e. their ability to absorb these pressures and sustain their functioning and services, is a major challenge. However, the mechanisms underlying resilience are still poorly understood. A main reason for this is the multidimensionality of both resilience, embracing the three fundamental stability properties recovery, resistance and persistence, and of the specific situations for which stability properties can be assessed. Agent-based models (ABM) complement empirical research which is, for logistic reasons, limited in coping with these multiple dimensions. Besides their ability to integrate multidimensionality through extensive manipulation in a fully controlled system, ABMs can capture the emergence of system resilience from individual interactions and feedbacks across different levels of organization. To assess the extent to which this potential of ABMs has already been exploited, we reviewed the state of the art in exploring resilience and its multidimensionality in ecological and socio-ecological systems with ABMs. We found that the potential of ABMs is not utilized in most models, as they typically focus on a single dimension of resilience by using variability as a proxy for persistence, and are limited to one reference state, disturbance type and scale. Moreover, only few studies explicitly test the ability of different mechanisms to support resilience. To overcome these limitations, we recommend to simultaneously assess multiple stability properties for different situations and under consideration of the mechanisms that are hypothesised to render a system resilient. This will help us to better exploit the potential of ABMs to understand and quantify resilience mechanisms, and hence support solving real-world problems related to the resilience of agent-based complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Case studies of ecosystem responses to changing climates are necessary in understanding and adapting to these changes. However, more general conceptual frameworks are also needed to contextualize and synthesize case studies, and to provide guidelines for assessment and prediction. This study analyzes a network model of ecological and soil state factor interrelationships to address issues such as sensitivity, resilience, and complexity of climate-driven terrestrial ecosystem changes. A factorial ecosystem model is analyzed using techniques from algebraic graph theory. Results show high values for spectral radius, graph energy, and algebraic connectivity. These indicate complexity, dynamical instability, active reverberating feedbacks, and high synchronization. Implications are that climate effects on ecosystems will be complicated, complex, and difficult to predict. We should be prepared for surprises in the form of unanticipated pathways and outcomes. The inherent nature of ecosystem interconnectivity indicated by the state factor model also suggests that when simulation models and change assessments do turn out to be wrong, it does not necessarily mean the underlying scientific understandings, data, or assumptions are wrong, as sensitivity to relatively minor variations and disturbances is high, and complexity and low predictability are inherent. Ecosystem reactions to climate (and other, often contemporaneous) changes will reverberate through the ecosystem. Both filtering and amplification may occur, but net amplification is indicated by the graph analysis. Ecosystem responses are integrated system responses-state factors will respond as a single integrated unit, not as a collection or sequence of individual responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
The loss of organic matter (OM) from soil during long-term agricultural cropping results in a decrease in the inherent fertility of the soil as well as releasing greenhouse gases. Despite the importance of organo-mineral associations in the stabilization of OM within soils, much remains unknown about these organo-mineral associations. We used nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) to investigate the incorporation and stabilization of C-13 and N-15 labelled residues of lucerne (Medicago sativa) and buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) when incubated in a Vertisol from temperate Australia for up to 365 d. We show that newly-added OM forms organo-mineral associations through two mechanisms. Firstly, it was observed that the newly-added OM forms associations with the existing mineral-bound OM. However, this apparent stabilization of newly-added OM by associating with existing mineral-bound OM was not influenced by the C:N ratio of the plant residues, with the lucerne residues (C:N ratio of 11) being incorporated to a similar extent as the buffel grass (C:N ratio of 35). Secondly, we observed that N-rich microbial metabolites attached directly to mineral particle surfaces that did not contain existing OM patches, thereby creating new organo-mineral associations through which additional stabilization of OM would be possible. The information obtained in this study is valuable in understanding the stabilization of OM through organo-mineral associations, and raises the possibility of using cover crops or catch crops with narrow C:N ratios to allow for formation of new organo-mineral associations for increased stabilization of OM in soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Phosphorus is a macro nutrient essential for optimum crop growth and animal health. The soil’s ability to supply P in an available form is influenced by sorption capacity and P binding energies in soil. These properties are usually derived from sorption isotherms that are time consuming and difficult for routine analysis. Mid-infrared diffuse reflectance Fourier transform (MIR DRIFT) spectroscopy is a rapid analysis technique that can potentially replace extractive and digestive techniques traditionally used in soil analysis. This study explored the application of MIR DRIFT in combination with chemometrics, to predict indicators of soil fertility and quality, specifically, P sorption properties. Using an archive of 11 great soil groups a P sorption reference library was generated using five different sorption models; (1) single point sorption index; (2) Langmuir sorption isotherm in the 0-25 mg l(-1) P range; (3) Langmuir sorption isotherm in the 0-50 mg l(-1) P range; (4) Freundlich sorption isotherm in the 0-25 mg l(-1 )P range; and (5) Freundlich sorption isotherm in the 0-50 mg l(-1) P range. Thirteen reference values were generated for each sample for calibration and validation of P sorption models developed from MIR DRIFT spectra. Validation of the single point P sorption index and Langmuir parameters were satisfactory for rough screening with the exception of the Langmuir binding energy in the 0-50 mg l(-1) P range (k(50) [8]). The P sorption capacity remaining was the best predicted parameter and the Freundlich sorption isotherm predictions were poor. The results indicated that there is potential for benchtop MIR to describe P sorption properties in agricultural soil to improve management decisions and that soil specific models could be developed to further enhance prediction performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices (e.g., conservation tillage, cover crops, and biochar applications) have been widely adopted to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity. However, current measurements regarding the influences of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration diverge widely, making it difficult to derive conclusions about individual and combined CSA management effects and bringing large uncertainties in quantifying the potential of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate change. We conducted a meta-analysis of 3,049 paired measurements from 417 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects of three common CSA management practices on SOC sequestration as well as the environmental controlling factors. We found that, on average, biochar applications represented the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39%), followed by cover crops (6%) and conservation tillage (5%). Further analysis suggested that the effects of CSA management practices were more pronounced in areas with relatively warmer climates or lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that, through adopting CSA practices, cropland could be an improved carbon sink. We also highlight the importance of considering local environmental factors (e.g., climate and soil conditions and their combination with other management practices) in identifying appropriate CSA practices for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Most studies on the biological effects of future climatic changes rely on seasonally aggregated, coarse-resolution data. Such data mask spatial and temporal variability in microclimate driven by terrain, wind and vegetation, and ultimately bear little resemblance to the conditions that organisms experience in the wild. Here, I present the methods for providing fine-grained, hourly and daily estimates of current and future temperature and soil moisture over decadal timescales. Observed climate data and spatially coherent probabilistic projections of daily future weather were disaggregated to hourly and used to drive empirically calibrated physical models of thermal and hydrological microclimates. Mesoclimatic effects (cold-air drainage, coastal exposure and elevation) were determined from the coarse-resolution climate surfaces using thin-plate spline models with coastal exposure and elevation as predictors. Differences between micro and mesoclimate temperatures were determined from terrain, vegetation and ground properties using energy balance equations. Soil moisture was computed in a thin upper layer and an underlying deeper layer, and the exchange of water between these layers was calculated using the van Genuchten equation. Code for processing the data and running the models is provided as a series of R packages. The methods were applied to the Lizard Peninsula, United Kingdom, to provide hourly estimates of temperature (100 m grid resolution over entire area, 1 m for a selected area) for the periods 1983-2017 and 2041-2049. Results indicated that there is a fine-resolution variability in climatic changes, driven primarily by interactions between landscape features and decadal trends in weather conditions. High-temporal resolution extremes in conditions under future climate change were predicted to be considerably less novel than the extremes estimated using seasonally aggregated variables. The study highlights the need to more accurately estimate the future climatic conditions experienced by organisms and equips biologists with the means to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
In boundary line analysis a biological response (e.g., crop yield) is assumed to be a function of a variable (e.g., soil nutrient concentration), which limits the response in only some subset of observations because other limiting factors also apply. The response function is therefore expressed by an upper boundary of the plot of the response against the variable. This model has been used in various branches of soil science. In this paper we apply it to the analysis of some large datasets, originating from commercial farms in England and Wales, on the recorded yield of wheat and measured concentrations of soil nutrients in within-field soil management zones. We considered boundary line models for the effects of potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) on yield, comparing the model with a simple bivariate normal distribution or a bivariate normal censored at a constant maximum yield. We were able to show, using likelihood-based methods, that the boundary line model was preferable in most cases. The boundary line model suggested that the standard RB209 soil nutrient index values (Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, nutrient management guide (RB209), 2017) are robust and apply at the within-field scale. However, there was evidence that wheat yield could respond to additional Mg at concentrations above index 0, contrary to RB209 guidelines. Furthermore, there was evidence that the boundary line model for yield and P differs between soils at different pH and depth intervals, suggesting that shallow soils with larger pH require a larger target P index than others. Highlights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boundary line analysis is one way to examine how soil variables influence crop yield in large datasets. We showed that boundary line models could be applied to large datasets on soil nutrients and crop yield. The resulting models are consistent with current practice for P and K, but not for Mg. Models suggest that more refined recommendations for P requirement could be based on soil pH and depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Understanding evolution of soils and landforms (and other Earth surface systems) has itself evolved from concepts of single-path, single-outcome development to those that recognize multiple possible developmental trajectories and different maturely developed stales. Soil geomorphology and pedology should now move beyond showing that multiple trajectories are possible to investigating why some evolutionary pathways (EPs) are common and persistent, whereas others are rare and transient. A typology of EPs is developed and applied to soil formation in the North Carolina coastal plain. Some EN are impossible because of violation of generally applicable laws or absence of necessary conditions; others are currently impossible, having occurred in the past but requiring conditions that no longer exist. Improbable paths are possible but rare, because necessary circumstances involve rare events or boundary conditions. Inhibited EPs are also possible but rare because of resistance factors or feedbacks that prevent or inhibit them. Transient paths may be common but are not long-lived or well preserved and are thus rarely observed. Recurring but nonrepeating EPs occur in different locations but are irreversible in any given location and cannot recur except in the case of system-resetting disturbance or new inputs. Recurring EPs are riot inhibited or self-limited, occur in different locations, and may be repeated because of ongoing or recurrent processes or conditions. Selected path types occur in multiple situations, but with increased probability due to feedbacks or responses that encourage or enhance recurrence and/or persistence. The case study shows examples of all possible EP types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
The occurrence of extreme hot and dry conditions in warm seasons can have large impacts on human health, energy and water supplies, agriculture and wildfires. Australian hot and dry extremes have been known to be associated with the occurrence of El Nino and other variations of tropospheric circulation. Here we identify an additional driver: variability of the stratospheric Antarctic polar vortex. On the basis of statistical analyses using observational data covering the past 40 yr, we show that weakenings and warmings of the stratospheric polar vortex, which episodically occur during austral spring, substantially increase the chances of hot and dry extremes and of associated fire-conducive weather across subtropical eastern Australia from austral spring to early summer. The promotion of these Australian climate extremes results from the downward coupling of the weakened polar vortex to tropospheric levels, where it is linked to the low-index polarity of the Southern Annular Mode, an equatorward shift of the mid-latitude westerly jet stream and subsidence and warming in the subtropics. Because of the long timescale of the polar vortex variations, the enhanced likelihood of early-summertime hot and dry extremes and wildfire risks across eastern Australia may be predictable a season in advance during years of vortex weakenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Global interest in soil health has increased exponentially during the past decade, with many different government, non-government, and private sector groups striving to develop monitoring and assessment protocols. This brief review focuses on developments in the United States (U.S.) with some references to activities in other countries. It also documents how the soil health concept evolved and projects what is needed to scientifically advance monitoring and assessment with a particular focus on activities in the U.S. Recommendations emphasize improving the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) and/or Comprehensive Assessment of Soil Health (CASH) assessment tools, developing protocols for national soil health monitoring, identifying and calibrating better indicators of soil biological, chemical, and physical health, and developing sensors and other tools for more rapid and in-situ assessments. Collectively, these and other research and technology transfer activities will help achieve what we suggest should be a universal goal - striving for healthy soils, healthy landscapes, and vibrant economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Soil spectral allocation or classification is usually conducted on air-dried soils. However, the field soils are not all air-dried, and the change of soil moisture will affect soil reflectance. We introduce a soil allocation model that considers the effect of soil moisture for the purpose of eliminating the effect of soil moisture. The topsoil spectral curves of four typical soils from the Songnen Plain in Northeast China were re-sampled to 10-nm intervals and converted to first-derivative spectral curves and continuum removal curves. The spectral feature parameters were extracted from continuum removal curves in the visible-near infrared (VNIR) range (350-2500 nm), and the range of 430-2400 nm was used to build soil allocation models for reducing the effect of noise. Samples with different soil moisture were mixed into air-dried soils and we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of different inputs to assess the effect of soil moisture and to find allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture. We used allocation indices of Zhang et al. (2018) because of the high accuracy of their DT (Decision Tree) model to allocate mixed-soil samples. We also used allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture to allocate mixed-soil samples with decision tree (DT), multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and multi-layer perception neural network (MLPNN), and compared the results of the two methods. The results show the following: 1) As SFPs were built with shorter bands, SFP was less sensitive to soil moisture than PCR and PCFD and thus SFP is more suitable to build soil allocation models that consider the effect of soil moisture as input than PCR and PCFD. 2) Differences in soil moisture had little effect on absorption valley shoulders, symmetry and absorption positions, moderate effect on absorption area and depth, and a major effect on the slope of different bands. 3) The effect of soil moisture on continuum removal curves of different soil classes was variable. There was little effect on Arenosols, a moderate effect on Chernozems and Cambisols, and a large effect on Phaeozems. 4) The accuracy of the DT model using allocation indices that were not affected by soil moisture was 91.892% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.888. Our results suggest that it is feasible to build soil spectral allocation models that are not affected by soil moisture, and this improves the universality of soil spectral allocation, especially to field soils, which can be of considerable help in soil classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
There has been much effort to improve the performance of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) using intelligent algorithms, but the issue of covariate shift, i.e., different probability distributions in training and testing datasets, and its impact on prediction uncertainty of PTFs has been rarely addressed. The common practice in PTF generation is to randomly separate the dataset into training and testing subsets, and the outcomes of this random selection may be different if the process is subject to covariate shift. We evaluated the impact of covariate shift generated by data shuffling and detected by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the prediction of water contents using soil databases from Denmark and Brazil. The soil water contents at different pressure heads were predicted by developing linear and stepwise regression besides machine learning based PTFs including Gaussian process regression and ensemble method. Regression based PTFs for the Brazilian dataset resulted in better predictions compared with machine learning methods, which in their turn estimated high water contents in Danish soils more accurately. One hundred PTFs were developed for water content at specific pressure heads by data shuffling. From these, 100 sets of fitted van Genuchten parameters were obtained representing the generated uncertainty. Data shuffling led to covariate shift, resulting in uncertainty in water content prediction by the PTFs. Inherent variability of data may lead to increased prediction uncertainty. For correlated data, simple regression models performed as good as sophisticated machine learning methods. Using PTF-predicted water contents for van Genuchten retention parameter fitting may lead to a high uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
The Atterberg limits (shrinkage limit [SL], plastic limit [PL], and liquid limit [LL]) describe the physico-mechanical behavior of soils and thus are crucial for civil and agricultural applications. Conventional laboratory methods for measurement of these limits are tedious and costly for a large number of samples. Our objective was to develop visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS, from 400-2500 nm) based reliable models to estimate the Atterberg limits. Two conventional methods for each Atterberg limit were used to generate the reference data: paraffin wax and Hg methods for SL; rolling and motorized devices for PL; and Casagrande cup and drop-cone penetrometer methods for LL. Calibration models were built on 80% of the data using partial least squares regression and validated with the remaining 20% of the dataset. The Vis-NIRS independent validation of LL showed very good estimation with standardized RMSE (SRMSE = RMSE/Range) of 0.16 and 0.15, respectively, for LLdrop-cone and LLCasagrande methods. Similarly for PL, the Vis-NIRS estimation accuracy was quite good with SRMSE values of 0.18 and 0.22, respectively, for PLmotorized and PLrolling. Reasonably good estimation was obtained for the SLparaffin and SLHg with SRMSE of 0.25 for both methods. The results suggest that the Vis-NIRS calibration models and the accuracy following validation were similar for the pair of methods used for the SL, PL, and LL. Finally, analyses of the model regression coefficients revealed that the important wavelengths to estimate the SL, PL, and LL in the Vis-NIR regions were present across the entire Vis-NIR spectrum and were strongly related to clay type and content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
The microbial partitioning of organic carbon (C) into either anabolic (i.e. growth) or catabolic (i.e. respiration) metabolic pathways represents a key process regulating the amount of added C that is retained in soil. The factors regulating C use efficiency (CUE) in agricultural soils, however, remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate substrate CUE from a wide range of soils (n = 970) and geographical area (200,000 km(2)) to determine which soil properties most influenced C retention within the microbial community. Using a C-14-labeling approach, we showed that the average CUE across all soils was 0.65 +/- 0.003, but that the variation in CUE was relatively high within the sample population (CV 14.9%). Of the major properties measured in our soils, we found that pH and exchangeable aluminum (Al) were highly correlated with CUE. We identified a critical pH transition point at which CUE declined (pH 5.5). This coincided exactly with the point at which Al3+ started to become soluble. In contrast, other soil factors [e.g. total C and nitrogen (N), dissolved organic C (DOC), clay content, available calcium, phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S), total base cations] showed little or no relationship with CUE. We also found no evidence to suggest that nutrient stoichiometry (C:N, C:P and C:S ratios) influenced CUE in these soils. Based on current evidence, we postulate that the decline in microbial CUE at low pH and high Al reflects a greater channeling of C into energy intensive metabolic pathways involved in overcoming H+/Al3+ stress (e.g. cell repair and detoxification). The response may also be associated with shifts in microbial community structure, which are known to be tightly associated with soil pH. We conclude that maintaining agricultural soils above pH 5.5 maximizes microbial energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is among the important soil properties that influence the partitioning of rainfall into surface and subsurface waters. Point estimates of K-s are difficult to determine and exhibit large spatial variability in fields. Often, data from field-scale rainfall-runoff experiments are utilized to assess the properties of the K-s random field that are required in the use of field-scale infiltration models. Standard methods of calibration are confounded by nonuniqueness and identifiability problems associated with experimental data. In this study, a new method that employed a field-averaged infiltration model and Monte Carlo simulations was used to obtain the possible range of distributions of K-s that would describe experimental observations over a field for a rainfall event. A Shannon information-theoretic approach was subsequently adopted to consolidate the ranges of K-s distributions over multiple rainfall events to yield the best range of K-s distributions. The method was applied to data from several rainfall-runoff events observed under natural conditions over an experimental field characterized by a silty loam soil and a small surface slope. Results suggest the existence of numerous parameter combinations that could satisfy the experimental observations over a single rainfall event, and high variability of these combinations among different events, thereby providing insights regarding the identifiable space of K-s distributions from individual rainfall experiments. Validation results showed that the method provides a realistic estimate of our ability to quantify the spatial variability of K-s in natural fields from rainfall-runoff experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract
The ever-increasing volume and accessibility of remote sensing data has spawned many alternative approaches for mapping important environmental features and processes. For example, there are several viable but highly varied strategies for using time series of Landsat imagery to detect changes in forest cover. Performance among algorithms varies across complex natural systems, and it is reasonable to ask if aggregating the strengths of an ensemble of classifiers might result in increased overall accuracy. Relatively simple rules have been used in the past to aggregate classifications among remotely sensed maps (e.g. using majority predictions), and in other fields, empirical models have been used to create situationally specific algorithm weights. The latter process, called “stacked generalization” (or “stacking”), typically uses a parametric model for the fusion of algorithm outputs. We tested the performance of several leading forest disturbance detection algorithms against ensembles of the outputs of those same algorithms based upon stacking using both parametric and Random Forests-based fusion rules. Stacking using a Random Forests model cut omission and commission error rates in half in many cases in relation to individual change detection algorithms, and cut error rates by one quarter compared to more conventional parametric stacking. Stacking also offers two auxiliary benefits: alignment of outputs to the precise definitions built into a particular set of empirical calibration data; and, outputs which may be adjusted such that map class totals match independent estimates of change in each year. In general, ensemble predictions improve when new inputs are added that are both informative and uncorrelated with existing ensemble components. As increased use of cloud-based computing makes ensemble mapping methods more accessible, the most useful new algorithms may be those that specialize in providing spectral, temporal, or thematic information not already available through members of existing ensembles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Thousands of small wetland depression features (cypress domes) dot the low-relief karst of Big Cypress National Preserve (BICY) in South Florida, USA. We hypothesized that these wetland depressions are organized in a regular pattern, which is atypical of wetlandscapes elsewhere. Regular patterning implies the existence of coupled feedbacks operating at different spatial scales, with local wetland depression expansion (facilitation via karst dissolution) limited by competition among adjacent depressions for finite water resources (inhibition). We sought to test the hypothesis that wetlands in BICY exhibit regular patterning, and to quantify pattern properties to evaluate competing genesis mechanisms. We tested four predictions about landscape structure and geometry using high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging elevation data from six 2.25-km(2) domains across BICY. Specifically, we predicted (1) feature overdispersion resulting from competition between adjacent basins; (2)
  truncated wetland area distributions due to growth inhibition feedbacks; (3) periodicity in surface elevation indicating a characteristic pattern wavelength; and (4) elevation bimodality indicating distinct upland and wetland states. All four predictions were strongly supported. Depressions were significantly overdispersed and efficiently fill the landscape, generating hexagonal patterning. Wetland areas followed truncated power law scaling, indicating incremental constraints on basin expansion, in contrast to depression areas elsewhere. Variogram and radial spectrum analyses revealed clear periodicity (similar to 150- to 250-m wavelength) in surface elevations. Finally, surface elevations were consistently bimodal with elevation divergence of 10 to 40 cm. Regular patterning of wetland depressions across BICY is clear, implying long-term biogeomorphic control on landform structure in this karst landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Functional diversity holds the promise of understanding ecosystems in ways unattainable by taxonomic diversity studies. Underlying this promise is the intuition that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But this promise also rests on several conceptual and methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions should be clearly addressed, notably for the sake of an effective comparison and integration across domains, and for assessing whether or not to use functional diversity approaches for developing ecological management strategies. The objective of this contribution is to identify and critically analyze the most salient of these assumptions. To this aim, we provide an epistemic roadmap that pinpoints these assumption
 s along a set of historical, conceptual, empirical, theoretical, and normative dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Traditional methods for determining soil water content at permanent wilting point (theta(PWP)) are time consuming. The objectives of this study are to develop a model for predicting theta(PWP) based on easily measured hygroscopic water content and to compare the performance of the proposed model with three previous models: the Aina &amp;amp; Periaswamy model (AP model), the van den Berg et al. model (vdB model) and the Seybold &amp;amp; Harms model (SH model), which estimate theta(PWP) from particle size distribution and/or organic matter (OM) content. By assuming that the dry end of the soil water retention curve could be described with the linear Campbell &amp;amp; Shiozawa model, a simple linear model, theta(PWP) = 3 theta(RH50), was developed to predict theta(PWP) using theta(RH50). The theta(RH50) of the soils ranged from 0.002 to 0.157 g g(-1) and the theta(PWP) ranged from 0.014 to 0.279 g g(-1). The validation results on 48 soils showed that the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolu
 te error (MAE) of the proposed model were 0.007 g g(-1) and 0.005 g g(-1), respectively. Model comparison showed that the prediction accuracy of four models for theta(PWP) was in the order of proposed model &amp;gt; AP model &amp;gt; SH model &amp;gt; vdB model. Thus, theta(RH50) is a viable predictor for theta(PWP), which eliminates the need for soil particle size distribution and OM content. HighlightsWater content at permanent wilting point (theta(PWP)) relates to hygroscopic water content. A model was developed to predict theta(PWP) using water content at relative humidity of 50%. The proposed model performed better than existing models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Extensive efforts are currently being devoted to the establishment of soil spectral libraries on regional, national, continent-wide and global domains. In particular, a new development goes in the direction of global harmonized soil spectral databases that shall be acquired following common standards and procedures so that they can be merged with other soil spectral libraries. The choice of standards is important, especially with respect to their behaviors when laboratory conditions, such as humidity, change. In this study, we test the application and robustness of the Internal Soil Standard (ISS) spectral re-alignment procedure on an extended number of soil samples acquired at different laboratories. In particular, a focus is placed on the comparison between two standards Lucky Bay (LB) and Wylie Bay (WB), for their performance with different humidity laboratory conditions. LB and WB are almost pure quartz sands from Australia. For this, 71 soil samples from Israel with diff
 erent mineralogical background and variable soil organic matter contents are scanned at two laboratories. The scanning took place with different spectral measurement protocols and extreme diverse conditions in terms of laboratory humidity and moist. All scans are completed by the repeated scans of the two Australian white sands through all scan batches to harmonize the spectral measurements. Our results show that the ISS minimizes the visual spectral variation, aligns the minor and extreme systematic changes of the protocols, and makes them more stable. Furthermore, the LB and WB standards do not exhibit equal performance regarding to relatively dry and humid conditions. The WB standard provides more stable and satisfactory results in humid condition. However, the high performance of the LB sample in spectral correction is still observed, particularly in laboratories with lower moist. Accordingly, these analyses suggest that in the ISS re-alignment procedure, the WB sample i
 s more reliable to be used in humid laboratory condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy has been established as a rapid and cost-efficient laboratory analysis technique for soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations. Current portable, high-performance handheld MIR instruments have opened the opportunity to take the technique from the laboratory to the field. We tested the potential of handheld MIR spectroscopy for SOC estimation with field spectral data against parallel VIS-NIR measurements and further evaluated the impact of soil state (in situ, dried, ground) on the accuracy of SOC prediction models. MIR and VIS-NIR data were collected for a set of 90 soils from 90 agricultural loess sites in Central Germany in the field, (i) in situ on the soil surface, and in the laboratory, on (ii) dried and sieved (&amp;lt; 2 mm), and (iii) dried, sieved and ground sample material (similar to 10 mu m). Multivariate calibrations for SOC for each pre-treatment were evaluated with a repeated double cross-validation (rdCV) analysis and the Kennard-Stone 
 (KS) calibration sampling approach. MIR calibrations were more accurate than VIS-NIR calibrations for samples measured under the same conditions in each case with lower RMSE values from 27 to 56% in the rdCV and from 15 to 61% in the KS approach. Sample pre-treatment in the laboratory had a pronounced effect on calibrations in the MIR as models developed on finely ground samples (R-rdCV(2) = 0.86, RMSErdCV = 0.11%) were more accurate than those for dried and sieved samples (R-rdCV(2) = 0.79, RMSErdCV = 0.13%), but differences in the VIS-NIR were negligible. SOC estimates with in situ MIR measurements were less accurate due to spectral variation induced by surface heterogeneity and soil moisture but compared favourably against VIS-NIR data (R-rdCV_MIR(2) = 0.63, RMSErdCV_MIR = 0.17% vs R-rdCV_VIS-NIR(2) = 0.39, RMSErdCV_VIS-NIR = 0.23%). Our findings show that portable MIR spectroscopy can achieve superior SOC calibrations to the VIS-NIR range with in situ data demonstrating 
 its applicability for the on-the-go acquisition of spectral !
 soil information in the field. Handheld MIR instruments thus have the potential to facilitate quantitative applications in proximal soil sensing, although with less accuracy than achievable with pre-treated samples in the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil physical quality (SPQ) is related to soil health and many studies have applied these indices manifesting soil structural behavior. A widely used hydraulic function in this analysis is the soil water retention curve (SWRC) and its integration holds important information, which reflects SPQ diversity. Usually, the SWRC is mathematically describing the relationship between volumetric soil water content (theta) and suction head (h) in the functions theta(h) and h(theta), in which h &amp;gt;= 0 and 0 &amp;lt; theta &amp;lt; 1. Geometrically, a logic way to describe the SWRC is applying the logarithm to the values of h to build the function theta(log(10)h) or log(10)h(theta), however, in this case the graph usually begins at h = 1, since log(10)(1) = 0. In several studies, the concept of the integral integral theta(h)dh [or integral h(theta)d theta] has been presented in the literature since 1978. Unfortunately, the integral integral log(10)h(theta)d theta should be used for h &amp;gt;= 1 in order to avo
 id negative results generated from the domain 0 &amp;lt; h &amp;lt; 1, which would be integrated to the final area under the SWRC. Furthermore, since the fitted values of the parameters of the Van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) equation are different when functions theta(h) and theta(log(10)h) are used, results of water content at saturation (theta(s)), permanent wilting point (theta(pwp)) and field capacity (theta(fc)) are different as well, questioning the applicability of the integral integral log(10)h(theta)d theta. The objective of this study was to develop a novel approach to calculate hydraulic-energy indices and to improve their capacity to reflect SPQ differences. In this approach, the function theta(h) was parameterized in order to find results for theta(s), theta(pwp) and theta(fc). Then, the function theta(log(10)h) was parameterized to obtain results for theta(s-pF), theta(pwp-pF) and theta(fc-pF), which were tested against theta(s), theta(pwp) and theta(fc). A total of 72 SWRCs were
  analysed with both functions theta(h) and (log(10)h). Resul!
 ts showed that the limits of integration theta(s-pF), theta(pwp-pF) and theta(fc-F) remained the same by keeping the same ranges of available water and drainable porosity, as in the case when the function theta(h) was used. This new approach turned out more suitable than the original approach for calculating hydraulic-energy indices, because it was more sensitive to reveal SPQ differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper presents the second part of the mapping of topsoil properties based on the Land Use and Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS). The first part described the physical properties (Ballabio et al., 2016) while this second part includes the following chemical properties: pH, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), calcium carbonates (CaCO3), C:N ratio, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The LUCAS survey collected harmonised data on changes in land cover and the state of land use for the European Union (EU). Among the 270,000 land use and cover observations selected for field visit, approximately 20,000 soil samples were collected in 24 EU Member States in 2009 together with more than 2000 samples from Bulgaria and Romania in 2012. The chemical properties maps for the European Union were produced using Gaussian process regression (GPR) models. GPR was selected for its capacity to assess model uncertainty and the possibility of adding prior knowledge in the form of covaria
 nce functions to the model.The derived maps will establish baselines that will help monitor soil quality and provide guidance to agroenvironmental research and policy developments in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Due to confounding factors such as crop residue and soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM) is usually estimated from soil samples in a laboratory or in the field at a local scale. In this study, laboratory and field data of crop residue, soil moisture, crop management practices, and SOM content were used in concert with multi-temporal MODIS images captured during bare soil periods over three years to construct spectral indices, which were then used as input variables to build a regional-scale SOM prediction model. Results showed that: (1) multi-temporal satellite images can be used to predict SOM content at a regional scale; (2) crop residue cover and time interval between snow melt, rainfall, and ploughing determined the optimal input variables for SOM prediction; (3) compared to a SOM model based on a single image, a multi-temporal model reduced the influence of soil moisture and improved both the stability and the accuracy of SOM prediction; (4) the best models generally
  used the ratio of MODIS Band 6 and Band 1 (R-61) as an input variable, as R-61 showed good correlation with SOM and less correlation with moisture; and (5) comparing different models in different years showed that models performed better in years with less crop residue. The study results can be used to improve the accuracy of quantitative estimates of the soil organic carbon pool and provide assistance in digital soil mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil heterogeneity is a major contributor to the uncertainty in predicting the environmental fate of data-scare contaminants. For this paper, we focused on research designed to predict the soil environmental fate of the new munition compound, called 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) -a compound increasingly employed by the U.S. and international militaries in the next-generation, insensitive explosive formulations. Here, we employed multi-variate statistical correlation models to predict DNAN sorption among different soil “types” seeking to reduce the uncertainty common in all contaminant sorption models by using soil taxonomic designation as a calibrant. We collected composite soils classified under the Ultisols taxonomic Order in the U.S. National Resource Conservation Service soil classification system and quantified their properties via physical and chemical characterizations. Using multivariate statistical modeling modified for compositional data analysis (CoDa), we developed qu
 antitative analogies of the Ultisols by partitioning the characterization data up into four different compositions: Water-extracted, Mehlich-III (referring to the weak acid) extracted, particle-size distribution, and solid-phase carbon-nitrogen-sulfur compositions. DNAN sorption was measured in batch soil suspensions and distribution coefficients (K-D) were calculated using linear regression modeling. Prediction models testing the correlation of the DNAN K-D values to the centered logratio-transformed compositions were calculated using CoDa-modified multilinear regression. Results showed that DNAN sorption was only predictable by dissolved organic carbon, pH, and the exchangeable cations Ca and K within the water-extracted composition. Analogies for DNAN sorption were the most discriminating at the Suborder level because of the inherent ambiguity in the Hapludults class at the Great Group level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
A correct quantification of soil surface and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is crucial for the evaluation of important soil functions, including atmospheric C sequestration. At present, soil science lacks (i) a clear definition of soil depth, (ii) consented procedures for soil sampling, as well as (iii) adequate awareness concerning pitfalls and caveats associated with quantification of soil surface area and large-scale SOC stocks in mountainous, complex landscapes. Traditional SOC stock quantification in these landscapes often did not adequately address site-specific geomorphological conditions and thus yielded incorrect results due to combination of incompatible methods for soil depth assessment, soil profile or core sampling, and soil surface area calculation. In our paper, we suggest unequivocal definitions of soil depth, horizon thickness, and SOC density, which can be applied for soils in sloping as well as flat terrain. Moreover, we quantify and discuss potential SOC
  (and other soil nutrient) stock assessment errors in mountainous regions, using the German Alps as case study. We present a protocol to ensure an unbiased quantification of soil surface area, as well as SOC or nutrient element stocks in mountainous landscapes. Taking into account the considerable area of sloping terrain on the global scale, and particularly in mountainous countries (e.g. Switzerland, Austria, Andes Countries, Nepal, Japan), our publication will contribute to a more accurate quantification of soil stocks of SOC and important nutrients as well as area-based C fluxes (e.g. CO2 sequestration or release) or other surface-related biogeochemical fluxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The performance of digital soil mapping (DSM) model is highly reliant on the intensity and spatial distribution of the input soil data points. Increasing the number of soil data points (i.e. samples) improves the accuracy of the prediction, but it also raises the sampling effort, including the time, money and labor required for field and laboratory analysis. Thus, optimizing the production of DSMs requires maximizing accuracy while minimizing cost. In this study, we evaluated a range of strategies for DSM of a farm field using high spatial resolution ancillary environmental data (e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle-UAV imagery) and compared sampling efforts of soil data generated from standard laboratory analysis (SLA) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) at equivalent costs. We produced DSMs of a number of soil properties including sand, silt, clay, pH, salinity, organic matter, and total nitrogen. We employed Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) to generate a range of sampl
 ing efforts from the full SLA (n = 62) and MIRS (n = 308) datasets and contrasted the DSM outcomes modeled using kriging with external drift (KED). We found that the DSM outputs were most effective, in terms of accuracy and cost, at 50-60% of the full sampling effort. Although MIRS predictions of soil properties introduced a sizable amount of error, DSMs produced using the MIRS dataset were more accurate as compared to the outcomes of SLA datasets at equivalent sampling efforts. The prediction accuracy for DSMs varied across the soil properties with R-2 ranging from 0.82 (for sand) to 0.45 (for total nitrogen) at the optimum sampling effort. The outcomes of the study highlight that spatially optimized sampling efforts and the use of the MIRS technique substantially improve the cost efficiency and accuracy of kriging-based DSM models for predicting a range of field scale soil properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The spatiotemporal variability of soil water content (SWC) at the remote sensing scale requires dense monitoring for calibration and validation. Here, we present an overview of the Texas Soil Observation Network (TxSON), an intensively monitored area in the semiarid rangelands of the central Texas Hill Country. TxSON is a dense network consisting of 40 in situ locations nested at 36, 9, and 3 km within the Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid and serves as a Core Calibration and Validation Site for NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The 4-yr dataset consists of hourly SWC measured at 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm. The SWC data are upscaled using arithmetic, Voronoi, and inverse distance weighting for 36-, (2) 9-, and (5) 3-km grid cells. We present the site selection, environmental characteristics, network design, quality assurance (QA), upscaling algorithms, and data structure. Ancillary data include bulk density, particle size, and carbon content for each site and depth. We also
  provide automated QA for each location and scripts to use our binary flagging in upscaling methods. To summarize, the 36-km grid cell has a mean bulk density of 1.34 +/- 0.18 g cm(-3) and a loam textural class. The in situ SWC has a root mean square error of 0.029 m(3) m(-3) against gravimetric data from 14 field campaigns. TxSON continues to add new locations with additional dense networks planned in other ecotones of the Edwards Plateau. The time series data along with scripts to import, plot, and upscaled SWC are available at https:// doi .org/10.18738/T8/JJ16CF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Survey (NASS) collects and publishes crop growth status and soil moisture conditions in major U.S. agricultural regions. The operationally produced weekly reports are based on survey information. The surveys are based on visual assessments and-in the case of soil moisture-report soil moisture levels in one of four categories (Very Short, Short, Adequate, and Surplus). In this study, we show that these reports have remarkable correspondence with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 Soil Moisture (L4SM) product. This consistency allows for combining the two different types of data to produce a value-added assessment, which enables cropland soil moisture mapping and state-level statistics. Moreover, it enables daily assessment rather than weekly. In this study classification thresholds are derived for L4SM by mapping cumulative distribution functions of L4
 SM surface and root zone SM to the categorical NASS SM conditions. The results show that, year over year, the SMAP cumulative SM distributions are consistent with the NASS SM conditions and, furthermore, that the temporal evolution of the SMAP-derived thresholds is consistent with the seasonal crop growth cycles from year to year. The results signify that the SMAP SM retrievals are relatable to SM estimation conducted in agricultural crop land by land managers and farmers, which underlines the general applicability of the SMAP data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper aims to provide alternative approaches for automatic classification of subsurface hydrocarbon-bearing regions from 2D seismic images driven by multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPs) (a kind of artificial neural network) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The first approach is based on a standard MLP whose features are controlled by Haralick’s textural descriptors; the second one is developed with a multiple-layer CNN. Both techniques are studied to identify geologic “leads”, instead of delineating other structures of the porous medium, such as salt bodies or seismic faults. The outcomes obtained from each approach are evaluated for a dataset of seismic images corresponding to the offshore SEAL Basin in Brazil’s northeastern. Performance indicators (accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure and loss) are computed to verify training and validation of the network learning capabilities. It is shown that for both MLP and CNN configurations, good agreement is 
 achieved in blind testing qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
A spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for the upload and provision of soil-agricultural research data in Germany was developed and launched in 2017. The precondition for the new SDI were to be compliant with the European initiative for spatial information (INSPIRE), to consider FAIR data principles, to be interoperable with other disciplinary national and international SDIs and to support dataset registrations with digital object identifiers (DOI). To meet these requirements, the new SDI had to support both the INSPIRE and DataCite metadata standards. As there was no metadata standard available that supported both metadata schemes from different disciplines, it became necessary to merge these two existing standards.The objective of this paper is to describe the developmental steps of the newly created BonaRes metadata schema for geospatial soil-agricultural research data. First, we analyzed the INSPIRE and DataCite metadata schemas, identified and compared semantically equivale
 nt metadata elements, including properties and allowed content values, for potential mapping. In the next step, we specified the new metadata model, whose elements were derived from INSPIRE or DataCite under consideration of the previously developed mapping. Third, additional metadata elements were defined to directly describe the underlying data model.The advantages and disadvantages of the method that was applied to define the BonaRes metadata schema elements originating from INSPIRE and DataCite schemas are presented and discussed. By implementing the new metadata model, the SDIs can achieve cross-portal metadata interoperability with other INSPIRE-compliant SDIs. Furthermore, researchers who store their geospatial research data in SDIs to implement the BonaRes metadata schema can increase the visibility and findability of their research, as the data can be assigned a DOI, which is a prerequisite for data citations and data publications. The new metadata elements of the B
 onaRes metadata schema allows targeted dataset queries, e.g.!
 , soil pH values, yields or parameters, which were measured by a specific method, using the underlying data model, and improves the discovery and reusability of research data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The stable longitudinal dunes in the northern Simpson Desert, Australia, were observed in satellite imagery to become more active after vegetation cover was reduced by fire and drought. Subsequent rainfall events also resulted in significant vegetation regrowth and dune stabilization. These switches between more active and stable conditions have not been previously described in the largely vegetated dune fields of central Australia. The observations, made on 12 dune sites, relied on high spatial resolution satellite imagery to observe dune crest activity, and seasonal Landsat fractional cover imagery to observe vegetation cover changes. The non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) component of the fractional vegetation cover images revealed significant changes in hummock grass cover on the dunes between 1988 and 2018, with a positive relationship with the three-year cumulative rainfall, disrupted by two periods of patchy burning. Only those sites that had burnt became active, and 
 only after vegetation cover had remained low (NPV &amp;lt; 16%) during the ‘Millennium Drought’. There is no threshold in vegetation cover, below which dune crests become active, but active dune features require four-years of low NPV cover (&amp;lt; 16%) to develop. The large rainfall event that ended the drought increased NPV cover, stabilizing the dunes. Similar hummock grass covered dunes are present across large areas of the arid zone, and are likely to respond in similar ways, given that fire and drought are common occurrences in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Cause-specific mortality forecasting is often based on predicting cause-specific death rates independently. Only a few methods have been suggested that incorporate dependence between causes. An attractive alternative is to model and forecast cause-specific death distributions, rather than mortality rates, as dependence between the causes can be incorporated directly. We follow this idea and propose two new models which extend the current research on mortality forecasting using death distributions. We find that adding age, time and cause-specific weights and decomposing both joint and individual variation between different causes of death increased the forecast accuracy of cancer deaths by using data for French and Dutch populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We tested one front-end data fusion method to combine visible near-infrared (vis-NIR) and portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectra for predicting different soil properties and investigated the contribution of different sensor data. A total of 197 soil samples were collected from 25 Alfisols and Mollisols in south-central Wisconsin, USA. Soils were analysed in the laboratory for clay, sand, silt content, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and pH. Air-dried soil samples were scanned with vis-NIR and PXRF spectrometers. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to each of the vis-NIR and PXRF spectra to extract the first 10 principal components (PCs), which were used in the Cubist model. Five types of input data were compared for constructing the models using a front-end data fusion approach, including: (a) 10 PCs from vis-NIR spectra, (b) 10 PCs from spectra of PXRF beam 1 (XRF40), (c) 10 PCs from spectra of PXRF beam 2 (XRF10), (d) concatenating 20 PCs from two PX
 RF spectra (XRF40 + 10), and (e) concatenating 30 PCs from two PXRF spectra and vis-NIR spectra (XRF40 + 10 + NIR). In addition, the performances of the preprocessing methods (four smoothing methods with or without background removal) of PXRF spectra were compared. Multiple linear regression was also used to predict soil properties directly from 11 PXRF-estimated elements. Our results suggest that smoothing should be applied to the PXRF spectra prior to developing predictive models. PXRF spectra and elemental data can predict soil texture with validation R-2 &amp;gt; 0.85, better than using solely vis-NIR spectra, and combining vis-NIR and PXRF spectra improved the prediction. Combining PXRF and vis-NIR can also predict TC and TN moderately well. Soil pH cannot be predicted from vis-NIR or PXRF spectra in this dataset due to its weak correlations with other soil properties and elements. It is concluded that PXRF spectra can be solely used to estimate soil texture, whereas combining
  vis-NIR and PXRF spectra via PCA should be used to estimate!

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Irrigation is essential for maintaining food production in water-scarce regions. The irrigation need depends on the water content of the soil, which we measured with the novel technique of cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS). The potential of the CRNS technique for drip irrigation scheduling was explored in this study for the Picassent site near Valencia, Spain. To support the experimental evidence, the neutron transport simulation URANOS was used to simulate the effect of drip irrigation on the neutron counts. The overall soil water content (SWC) in the CRNS footprint was characterized with a root mean square error &amp;lt;0.03 cm(3)/cm(3), but the experimental dataset indicated methodological limitations to detect drip water input. Both experimental data and simulation results suggest that the large-area neutron response to drip irrigation is insignificant in our specific case using a standard CRNS probe. Because of the small area of irrigated patches and short irrigation time, the 
 limited SWC changes due to drip irrigation were not visible from the measured neutron intensity changes. Our study shows that CRNS modeling can be used to assess the suitability of the CRNS technique for certain applications. While the standard CRNS probe was not able to detect small-scale drip irrigation patterns, the method might be applicable for larger irrigated areas, in drier regions, and for longer and more intense irrigation periods. Since statistical noise is the main limitation of the CRNS measurement, the capability of the instrument could be improved in future studies by larger and more efficient neutron detectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Measurements of aeolian sediment transport support our understanding of mineral dust impacts on Earth and human systems and assessments of aeolian process sensitivities to global environmental change. However, sample design principles are often overlooked in aeolian research. Here we use high-density field measurements of sediment mass flux across land use and land cover types to examine sample size and power effects on detecting change in aeolian transport. Temporal variances were 1.6 to 10.1 times the magnitude of spatial variances in aeolian transport for six study sites. Differences in transport were detectable for &amp;gt;67% of comparisons among sites using similar to 27 samples. Failure to detect change with smaller sample sizes suggests that aeolian transport measurements and monitoring are much more uncertain than recognized. We show how small and selective sampling, common in aeolian research, gives the false impression that differences in aeolian transport can be detected
 , potentially undermining inferences about process and impacting reproducibility of aeolian research.Plain Language Summary Aeolian sediment transport, including wind erosion and dust emission, impacts agricultural production and food security, nutrient cycling, water resources, and climate. Measuring aeolian sediment transport is therefore important for developing an understanding of its impacts on Earth systems and society. However, little consideration has been given to how many samples are needed to measure aeolian transport and detect its change across space and through time. We investigate how sample size, design, and decisions about the precision of change detection affect aeolian transport monitoring. Using field measurements, we show that traditional approaches in aeolian research with small sample sizes and selective placement of equipment are often unable to detect change and support robust inferences about aeolian processes. Unless large numbers of samples are us
 ed, uncertainty in field measurements can be so large that i!
 t undermines our understanding of how and why aeolian sediment transport rates change across space and through time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) has been recognized as an opportunity to off-set global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Flipping (full inversion to 1-3 m) is a practice used on New Zealand’s South Island West Coast to eliminate water-logging in highly podzolized sandy soils. Flipping results in burial of SOC formed in surface soil horizons into the subsoil and the transfer of subsoil material low in SOC to the “new” topsoil. The aims of this study were to quantify changes in the storage and stability of SOC over a 20-year period following flipping of high-productive pasture grassland. Topsoils (0-30 cm) from sites representing a chronosequence of flipping (3-20 years old) were sampled (2005/07) and re-sampled (2017) to assess changes in topsoil carbon stocks. Deeper samples (30-150 cm) were also collected (2017) to evaluate the changes in stocks of SOC previously buried by flipping. Density fractionation was used to determine SOC stability in recent and buried tops
 oils. Total SOC stocks (0-150 cm) increased significantly by 69 +/- 15% (179 +/- 40 Mg SOC ha(-1)) over 20 years following flipping. Topsoil burial caused a one-time sequestration of 160 +/- 14 Mg SOC ha(-1) (30-150 cm). The top 0-30 cm accumulated 3.6 Mg SOC ha(-1) year(-1). The chronosequence and re-sampling revealed SOC accumulation rates of 1.2-1.8 Mg SOC ha(-1) year(-1) in the new surface soil (0-15 cm) and a SOC deficit of 36 +/- 5% after 20 years. Flipped subsoils contained up to 32% labile SOC (compared to &amp;lt; 1% in un-flipped subsoils) thus buried SOC was preserved. This study confirms that burial of SOC and the exposure of SOC depleted subsoil results in an overall increase of SOC stocks of the whole soil profile and long-term SOC preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Drought, widely studied as an important driver of ecosystem dynamics, is predicted to increase in frequency and severity globally. To study drought, ecologists must define or at least operationalize what constitutes a drought. How this is accomplished in practice is unclear, particularly given that climatologists have long struggled to agree on definitions of drought, beyond general variants of “an abnormal deficiency of water.” We conducted a literature review of ecological drought studies (564 papers) to assess how ecologists describe and study drought. We found that ecologists characterize drought in a wide variety of ways (reduced precipitation, low soil moisture, reduced streamflow, etc.), but relatively few publications (similar to 32%) explicitly define what are, and are not, drought conditions. More troubling, a surprising number of papers (similar to 30%) simply equated “dry conditions” with “drought” and provided little characterization of the drought conditions stu
 died. For a subset of these, we calculated Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index values for the reported drought periods. We found that while almost 90% of the studies were conducted under conditions quantifiable as slightly to extremely drier than average, similar to 50% were within the range of normal climatic variability. We conclude that the current state of the ecological drought literature hinders synthesis and our ability to draw broad ecological inferences because drought is often declared but is not explicitly defined or well characterized. We suggest that future drought publications provide at least one of the following: (a) the climatic context of the drought period based on long-term records; (b) standardized climatic index values; (c) published metrics from drought-monitoring organizations; (d) a quantitative definition of what the authors consider to be drought conditions for their system. With more detailed and consistent quantification of drough
 t conditions, comparisons among studies can be more rigorous!
 , increasing our understanding of the ecological effects of drought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Increasing the potential of soil to store carbon (C) is an acknowledged and emphasized strategy for capturing atmospheric CO2. Well-recognized approaches for soil C accretion include reducing soil disturbance, increasing plant biomass inputs, and enhancing plant diversity. Yet experimental evidence often fails to support anticipated C gains, suggesting that our integrated understanding of soil C accretion remains insufficient. Here we use a unique combination of X-ray micro-tomography and micro-scale enzyme mapping to demonstrate for the first time that plant-stimulated soil pore formation appears to be a major, hitherto unrecognized, determinant of whether new C inputs are stored or lost to the atmosphere. Unlike monocultures, diverse plant communities favor the development of 30-150 mu m pores. Such pores are the micro-environments associated with higher enzyme activities, and greater abundance of such pores translates into a greater spatial footprint that microorganisms ma
 ke on the soil and consequently soil C storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper presents novel methods for robust statistical testing of particle shape data. Shape (the relative lengths of three orthogonal axes) is a key property of sedimentary particles, providing information on provenance, transport history and depositional environment. However, the usefulness of shape data, including the ability to make robust comparisons between samples, has been constrained by the absence of a satisfactory definition of the mean shape for a sample of particles. Such a definition is proposed and used to develop confidence regions for the population mean shape using both parametric (theoretical) and computational (bootstrap) methods. These techniques are based on a transform that permits multivariate statistical methods for the analysis of compositional data to be extended to shape. These techniques are validated with reference to a dataset of 169 clast samples and found to perform well. A statistical test on the mean - using the multivariate extension of S
 tudent’s t-test, Hotelling’s T-2 - is presented. The benefits of the methods presented are demonstrated with reference to a case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Dual-permeability models simulate flow and transport within soils characterized by preferential (macro) and matrix (micro) pore domains, with each exhibiting distinct hydraulic properties. The lack of suitable methods for determining appropriate and physically based model parameters remains a major challenge to applying these models. Here, we present a method that characterizes dual-permeability model parameters using experimental results of saturated flows from water and a non-Newtonian fluid. We present two submodels that solve for the effective pore sizes of micropores and macropores, with macropores represented either with cylindrical (for biological pores) or planar (for shrinkage cracks and fissures) pore geometries. The model also determines the percentage contribution (wi) of the representative macro-and micropores to water flow. We applied the model to experimental soil samples complemented with capillary tubes simulating the macropores and showed its ability to deri
 ve the bimodal pore size distributions in dual-domain soils using only two fluids. As such, we present this method of characterization of dual structures for improved modeling of nonuniform preferential flow and transport in macroporous soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil hydrology is a key control for the functioning of the terrestrial environment. Many environmental issues that we need to tackle today are directly linked to soil water dynamics. This includes agricultural production and food security, nutrient cycling and carbon storage, prevention of soil degradation and erosion, and last but not least, clean water resources and flood protection. However, these problems need to be addressed at the scales of fields, regions, and landscapes, while soil water dynamics and soil hydraulic properties are well understood and typically measured at much smaller scales-the comfort zone of soil physics. An obvious problem is how to link these vastly different scales and how to profit from small-scale understanding to improve our capability to predict what is going on at the large scale. In this update, this problem is discussed based on insights gained during the last decades. As a synthesis, a two-step scaling approach is proposed for modeling so
 il water dynamics from local to landscape scales where the scale of the soil profile is the stepping stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil-covered upland landscapes comprise a critical part of the habitable world and our understanding of their evolution as a function of different climatic, tectonic, and geologic regimes is important across a wide range of disciplines. Soil production and transport play essential roles in controlling the spatial variation of soil depth and therefore hillslope hydrological processes, distribution of vegetation, and soil biological activity. Field-based confirmation of the hypothesized relationship between soil thickness and soil production is relatively recent, however, and here we quantify a direct, material strength-based influence on variable soil production across landscapes. We report clear empirical linkages between the shear strength of the parent material (its erodibility) and the overlying soil thickness. Specifically, we use a cone penetrometer and a shear vane to determine saprolite resistance to shear. We find that saprolite shear strength increases systematically
  with overlying soil thickness across three very different field sites where we previously quantified soil production rates. At these sites, soil production rates, determined from in situ produced beryllium-10 (Be-10) and aluminum-26 (Al-26), decrease with overlying soil thickness and we therefore infer that the efficiency of soil production must decrease with increasing parent material shear strength. We use our field-based data to help explain the linkages between biogenic processes, chemical weathering, hillslope hydrology, and the evolution of the Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are widely employed to generate soil maps. Soil properties are typically predicted individually, while ignoring the interrelation between them. Models for predicting multiple properties exist, but they are computationally demanding and often fail to provide accurate description of the associated uncertainty. In this paper a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is described to predict several soil properties with quantified uncertainty. CNN has the advantage that it incorporates spatial contextual information of environmental covariates surrounding an observation. A single CNN model can be trained to predict multiple soil properties simultaneously. I further propose a two-step approach to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction for mapping using a neural network model. The methodology is tested mapping six soil properties on the French metropolitan territory using measurements from the LUCAS dataset and a large set of environmental 
 covariates portraying the factors of soil formation. Results indicate that the multivariate CNN model produces accurate maps as shown by the coefficient of determination and concordance correlation coefficient, compared to a conventional machine learning technique. For this country extent mapping, the maps predicted by CNN have a detailed pattern with significant spatial variation. Evaluation of the uncertainty maps using the median of the standardized squared prediction error and accuracy plots suggests that the uncertainty was accurately quantified, albeit slightly underestimated. The tests conducted using different window size of input covariates to predict the soil properties indicate that CNN benefits from using local contextual information in a radius of 4.5 km. I conclude that CNN is an effective model to predict several soil properties and that the associated uncertainty can be accurately quantified with the proposed approach.&lt;/p&gt;
