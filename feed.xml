&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-enzymes-as-indicators-of-soil-function-a-step-toward-greater-realism-in-microbial-ecological-modeling&quot;&gt;Soil enzymes as indicators of soil function: A step toward greater realism in microbial ecological modeling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles and their complex responses to environmental changes have received increasing attention. However, large uncertainties in model predictions remain, partially due to the lack of explicit representation and parameterization of microbial processes. One great challenge is to effectively integrate rich microbial functional traits into ecosystem modeling for better predictions. Here, using soil enzymes as indicators of soil function, we developed a competitive dynamic enzyme allocation scheme and detailed enzyme-mediated soil inorganic N processes in the Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model. We conducted a rigorous calibration and validation of MEND with diverse soil C-N fluxes, microbial C:N ratios, and functional gene abundances from a 12-year CO2 x N grassland experiment (BioCON) in Minnesota, USA. In addition to accurately simulating soil CO2 fluxes and multiple N variables, the model correctly predicted microbial C:N ratios and their negative response to enriched N supply. Model validation further showed that, compared to the changes in simulated enzyme concentrations and decomposition rates, the changes in simulated activities of eight C-N-associated enzymes were better explained by the measured gene abundances in responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. Our results demonstrated that using enzymes as indicators of soil function and validating model predictions with functional gene abundances in ecosystem modeling can provide a basis for testing hypotheses about microbially mediated biogeochemical processes in response to environmental changes. Further development and applications of the modeling framework presented here will enable microbial ecologists to address ecosystem-level questions beyond empirical observations, toward more predictive understanding, an ultimate goal of microbial ecology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-type-of-gully-is-that-the-need-for-a-classification-of-gullies&quot;&gt;What type of gully is that? The need for a classification of gullies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite over a century of investigations into gullies and gully erosion, the characterization and categorization of gullies and the varied definitions, nomenclatures and terminology used has caused some confusion in understanding and communicating the relationships of gully forms and processes around the world. We firstly review the gully literature and highlight how a lack of consistency in gully definition and characterization prevents unifying theory from being developed within this important field of research, since it is often unclear whether different landscape features being discussed are comparable. We propose that conventionally employed qualitative planform and cross-sectional characteristics of gullies alone are inadequate to define gully types, yet both these features remain central to most modern gully descriptions. We discuss the need to revise and augment these basic characteristics with clearly defined morphogenetic attributes such as landscape context, soil material characteristics, erosion processes, hydrological integrity, modes of development, and head/side-wall morphology for an effective, practicable, generic gully classification scheme. Central to a gully classification scheme is the need for a clear definition of what a gully is - and is not - for which geomorphological criteria are proposed to differentiate a ‘gully’ from other ‘incisional land surface forms’. This gully definition hinges largely on the identification of a retreating head scarp and the internal erosion by mass-movement and other sidewall slope erosion processes, coupled with the transport of the soil materials from the gully void. By defining a gully and synthesizing descriptions of gully ‘types’ from the literature and our own experience, we propose key morphogenetic attributes of gullies necessary to form a framework for a systematic gully classification scheme. An initial, eclectic classification framework is presented as both a summation and a synthesis of the literature review, and as a progenitor to a dynamic generic classification scheme that is proposed in a follow-up article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-naturalness-index-for-the-identification-of-natural-areas-on-regional-scale&quot;&gt;The naturalness index for the identification of natural areas on regional scale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have been trying to measure the influence of humankind on our environment for several decades. Among the technical solutions for this goal, approaches for a rule-based fusion of different geospatial information layers have reached the greatest level of maturity, enabling the (semi-)automatic production of maps at resolutions of about 1 square kilometer. While those existing approaches aim at a global analysis of human influence, conservation efforts are usually implemented on a regional scale. To bridge the gap between a global, lowresolution analysis and a local, high-resolution analysis, with this paper, we propose the Naturalness Index (NI), which represents the naturalness of the Earth’s surface as a metric between 0 and 100 at a spatial resolution of 10 m per pixel. Our approach builds on the established Human Influence Index, but replaces different geospatial input layers with more recent, higher resolution counterparts. Using the cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine, regional maps at a resolution of 10 m x 10 m per pixel can be produced efficiently in a fully automatic manner. We demonstrate the functionality by creating maps for three different localities in Europe - Bavaria, Lapland, and Scotland. A comparison of the NI values achieved with our approach to official conservation areas as well as a correlation with existing similar maps indicate the validity of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;management-foundations-for-navigating-ecological-transformation-by-resisting-accepting-or-directing-social-ecological-change&quot;&gt;Management Foundations for Navigating Ecological Transformation by Resisting, Accepting, or Directing Social-Ecological Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite striking global change, management to ensure healthy landscapes and sustained natural resources has tended to set objectives on the basis of the historical range of variability in stationary ecosystems. Many social-ecological systems are moving into novel conditions that can result in ecological transformation. We present four foundations to enable a transition to future-oriented conservation and management that increases capacity to manage change. The foundations are to identify plausible social-ecological trajectories, to apply upstream and deliberate engagement and decision-making with stakeholders, to formulate management pathways to desired futures, and to consider a portfolio approach to manage risk and account for multiple preferences across space and time. We use the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as a case study to illustrate how the four foundations address common land management challenges for navigating transformation and deciding when, where, and how to resist, accept, or direct social-ecological change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responding-to-ecological-transformation-mental-models-external-constraints-and-manager-decision-making&quot;&gt;Responding to Ecological Transformation: Mental Models, External Constraints, and Manager Decision-Making&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecological transformation creates many challenges for public natural resource management and requires managers to grapple with new relationships to change and new ways to manage it. In the context of unfamiliar trajectories of ecological change, a manager can resist, accept, or direct change, choices that make up the resist-accept-direct (RAD) framework. In this article, we provide a conceptual framework for how to think about this new decision space that managers must navigate. We identify internal factors (mental models) and external factors (social feasibility, institutional context, and scientific uncertainty) that shape management decisions. We then apply this conceptual framework to the RAD strategies (resist, accept, direct) to illuminate how internal and external factors shape those decisions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how this conceptual framework shapes our understanding of management decisions, especially how these decisions are not just ecological but also social, and the implications for research and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-salinity-a-global-threat-to-sustainable-development&quot;&gt;Soil salinity: A global threat to sustainable development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil is a vital resource for feeding the burgeoning global population, and it is also essential for realizing most of the ‘United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)’. For example, it is vital to realizing the ‘Zero hunger (SDG2), Good health and well-being (SDG3), Clean water and sanitation (SDG6), and Life on land (SDG15)’. Excess salts present in the soil make it saline, and it poses a significant threat to agricultural production and environmental health. Soil salinity is an extensive problem and spreads over one billion hectares extended over 100 countries. This paper presents a comprehensive review of global soil salinity management through the applications of remote sensing and GIS. All possible sources of relevant and current literature were accessed and more than 260 publications were collected and carefully analysed, for this review. The rationale and severity of the salinity problem are provided. The impact of salinity on plant yield and the effect of climate change on soil salinity are detailed. The salinity indicators and salinity monitoring and mapping are provided, and the global cases of soil salinity management through remote sensing and GIS applications under different agro-hydro-climatic environments are discussed, followed by a summary of conclusions and challenges along with future research directions. The analysis of past investigations showed that remote sensing strategy might be a practical approach to adequately assess plant response such as evapotranspiration under diverse salinity environments, yet it additionally has various difficulties. The lower spatial and temporal resolution of imagery may reason errors because of subpixel heterogeneity. However, with the improvement of the better-resolution thermal infrared remote method, there is the possibility to spot spatial variations at a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time in the practice of geotechnical engineering, soil has been viewed as an inert material, comprising only inorganic phases. However, microorganisms including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes are ubiquitous in soil and have the capacity and capability to alter bio-geochemical processes in the local soil environment. The cumulative changes could consequently modify the physical, mechanical, conductive and chemical properties of the bulk soil matrix. In recent years, the topic of bio-mediated geotechnics has gained momentum in the scientific literature. It involves the manipulation of various bio-geochemical soil processes to improve soil engineering performance. In particular, the process of microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) has received the most attention for its superior performance for soil improvement. The present work aims to shape a comprehensive understanding of recent developments in bio-mediated geotechnics, with a focus on MICP. Referring to around one hundred studies published over the past five years, this review focuses on popular and alternative MICP processes, innovative raw materials and additives for MICP, emerging tools and testing methodologies for characterizing MICP at multi-scale, and applications in emerging and/or unconventional geotechnical fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-miniaturized-method-for-fast-simple-and-sensitive-pesticide-analysis-in-soils&quot;&gt;A miniaturized method for fast, simple, and sensitive pesticide analysis in soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) like lindane and DDT have been used extensively after World War II until the 1990s. Still, residues of these pesticides can be found in agricultural soils all over the world, especially in developing countries. Often, they occur in extensive areas and elevated concentrations so that food safety is jeopardized. Hence, simple, cheap, and fast analytical methods are needed for a straight-forward assessment of risks. A miniaturized solid-liquid extraction combined with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) based on a proven ISO method is presented. Methods The performance of the method is evaluated by extracting three different soils which were spiked with HCH and DDT congeners, and trifluralin, and aged for 35 days. The results are compared with those of a modified quick, easy, cheap, efficient, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. For further validation, both methods are applied to three environmental soil samples. Results Validation results show limits of detection and quantification as well as recovery rates in good agreement with standard requirements. The new method was found to be quicker than QuEChERS, which requires time-consuming preparation of reagents. Conclusion Merits include low time and sample volume requirements (0.5 g) and the possibility to extract many samples simultaneously, which allows the screening of large sample sizes to determine the pollution status of whole landscape regions. However, access to an automated SPME apparatus is assumed. The authors can recommend this method as a cheap and fast alternative where SPME is available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Estimating cation exchange capacity from agronomic soil tests: Comparing Mehlich-3 and ammonium acetate sum of cations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluation of Mehlich-3 for determination of cation exchange capacity in Kansas soils&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-meaning-of-net-zero-and-how-to-get-it-right&quot;&gt;The meaning of net zero and how to get it right&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of net-zero carbon emissions has emerged from physical climate science. However, it is operationalized through social, political and economic systems. We identify seven attributes of net zero, which are important to make it a successful framework for climate action. The seven attributes highlight the urgency of emission reductions, which need to be front-loaded, and of coverage of all emission sources, including currently difficult ones. The attributes emphasize the need for social and environmental integrity. This means carbon dioxide removals should be used cautiously and the use of carbon offsets should be regulated effectively. Net zero must be aligned with broader sustainable development objectives, which implies an equitable net-zero transition, socio-ecological sustainability and the pursuit of broad economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net-zero emissions is more than a concept of physical climate science. It is implemented in social, political and economic contexts. This Perspective proposes seven attributes that are critical for the practical and effective implementation of net zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-cation-exchange-capacity-from-agronomic-soil-tests-comparing-mehlich-3-and-ammonium-acetate-sum-of-cations&quot;&gt;Estimating cation exchange capacity from agronomic soil tests: Comparing Mehlich-3 and ammonium acetate sum of cations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) measures the capability of soils to hold and release nutrients. It is an important measure for classifying soils and planning nutrient additions, but it is not included in routine soil tests offered to farmers. In this study, we compared CEC measured with standard laboratory practices (neutral ammonium acetate [AAc]) with CEC estimated from agronomic soil test data (Mehlich-3 and AAc). We applied previously published estimation methods to a dataset of 48 soil samples. Based on the results, traditional methods underestimate measured cation exchange capacity by 36% for Mehlich-3 and 24% for AAc. The estimation can be improved by including aluminium (12% overestimate) or by fitting a localized pedotransfer function (3% underestimate), which offers a possibility for informing land managers about their soil nutrient holding capacity without adding costs to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluation-of-mehlich-3-for-determination-of-cation-exchange-capacity-in-kansas-soils&quot;&gt;Evaluation of Mehlich-3 for determination of cation exchange capacity in Kansas soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil testing laboratories across the United States have implemented the Mehlich-3 (M3) extraction method for phosphorus (P) and other nutrients. Though M3 is known to work well as a multinutrient extractant, it raises concerns for measuring exchangeable cations, particularly in calcareous soils. The objectives of this study were (a) to evaluate M3 as an extractant for base cations for Kansas soils, (b) to identify a range of soil pH where M3 may be a suitable replacement for ammonium acetate (AA), and (c) to examine the relationship between cation exchange capacity (CEC) summation and CEC displacement. A study was conducted evaluating 308 soils collected from across Kansas and extracted using both the M3 and AA soil extraction methods. Cation exchange capacity was estimated using the summation approach from measurements of both the M3 and AA, and the displacement method. Results indicate a strong correlation among M3 and AA methods for K, Mg, and Na (R-2 = .98, .96, .97, respectively). However, these relationships were considerably weaker for extractable Ca (R-2 = .78), where extractable Ca was higher in the M3 extracts for high pH soils. Estimated CEC was also affected by soil pH for the M3 method, with an estimated critical pH value of 7.3. Extractable Ca and CEC for soils with a pH below 7.3 showed a strong correlation between M3 and AA methods (R-2 = .9). Using M3 as a multinutrient extractant can improve turnaround time for sample analysis in soil testing laboratories. However, the use of the M3 procedure in soils with a pH of 7.3 or above will likely result in overestimation of exchangeable Ca and CEC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-open-path-eddy-covariance-method-for-nitrous-oxide-and-other-trace-gases-that-minimizes-temperature-corrections&quot;&gt;A new open-path eddy covariance method for nitrous oxide and other trace gases that minimizes temperature corrections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-power, open-path gas sensors enable eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements in remote areas without line power. However, open-path flux measurements are sensitive to fluctuations in air temperature, pressure, and humidity. Laser-based, open-path sensors with the needed sensitivity for trace gases like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are impacted by additional spectroscopic effects. Corrections for these effects, especially those related to temperature fluctuations, often exceed the flux of gases, leading to large uncertainties in the associated fluxes. For example, the density and spectroscopic corrections arising from temperature fluctuations can be one or two orders of magnitude greater than background N2O fluxes. Consequently, measuring background fluxes with laser-based, open-path sensors is extremely challenging, particularly for N2O and gases with similar high-precision requirements. We demonstrate a new laser-based, open-path N2O sensor and a general approach applicable to other gases that minimizes temperature-related corrections for EC flux measurements. The method identifies absorption lines with spectroscopic effects in the opposite direction of density effects from temperature and, thus, density and spectroscopic effects nearly cancel one another. The new open-path N2O sensor was tested at a corn (Zea mays L.) field in Southwestern Michigan, United States. The sensor had an optimal precision of 0.1 ppbv at 10 Hz and power consumption of 50 W. Field trials showed that temperature-related corrections were 6% of density corrections, reducing EC random errors by 20-fold compared to previously examined lines. Measured open-path N2O EC fluxes showed excellent agreement with those made with static chambers (m = 1.0 +/- 0.3; r(2) = .96). More generally, we identified absorption lines for CO2 and CH4 flux measurements that can reduce the temperature-related corrections by 10-100 times compared to existing open-path sensors. The proposed method provides a new direction for future open-path sensors, facilitating the expansion of accurate EC flux measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-global-overview-of-studies-about-land-management-land-use-change-and-climate-change-effects-on-soil-organic-carbon&quot;&gt;A global overview of studies about land management, land-use change, and climate change effects on soil organic carbon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major drivers of gains or losses in soil organic carbon (SOC) include land management, land-use change, and climate change. Thousands of original studies have focused on these drivers of SOC change and are now compiled in a growing number of meta-analyses. To critically assess the research efforts in this domain, we retrieved and characterized 192 meta-analyses of SOC stocks or concentrations. These meta-analyses comprise more than 13,200 original studies conducted from 1910 to 2020 in 150 countries. First, we show that, despite a growing number of studies over time, the geographical coverage of studies is limited. For example, the effect of land management, land-use change, and climate change on SOC has been only occasionally studied in North and Central Africa, and in the Middle East and Central Asia. Second, the meta-analyses investigated a limited number of land management practices, mostly mineral fertilization, organic amendments, and tillage. Third, the meta-analyses demonstrated relatively low quality and transparency. Lastly, we discuss the mismatch between the increasing number of studies and the need for more local, reusable, and diversified knowledge on how to preserve high SOC stocks or restore depleted SOC stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-carbon-stocks-in-temperate-grasslands-differ-strongly-across-sites-but-are-insensitive-to-decade-long-fertilization&quot;&gt;Soil carbon stocks in temperate grasslands differ strongly across sites but are insensitive to decade-long fertilization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing soil carbon (C) storage has the potential to offset human-caused increases in atmospheric CO2. Rising CO2 has occurred concurrently with increasing supply rates of biologically limiting nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). However, it is unclear how increased supplies of N and P will alter soil C sequestration, particularly in grasslands, which make up nearly a third of non-agricultural land worldwide. Here, we leverage a globally distributed nutrient addition experiment (the Nutrient Network) to examine how a decade of N and P fertilization (alone and in combination) influenced soil C and N stocks at nine grassland sites spanning the continental United States. We measured changes in bulk soil C and N stocks and in three soil C fractions (light and heavy particulate organic matter, and mineral-associated organic matter fractions). Nutrient amendment had variable effects on soil C and N pools that ranged from strongly positive to strongly negative, while soil C and N pool sizes varied by more than an order of magnitude across sites. Piecewise SEM clarified that small increases in plant C inputs with fertilization did not translate to greater soil C storage. Nevertheless, peak season aboveground plant biomass (but not root biomass or production) was strongly positively related to soil C storage at seven of the nine sites, and across all nine sites, soil C covaried with moisture index and soil mineralogy, regardless of fertilization. Overall, we show that site factors such as moisture index, plant productivity, soil texture, and mineralogy were key predictors of cross-site soil C, while nutrient amendment had weaker and site-specific effects on C sequestration. This suggests that prioritizing the protection of highly productive temperate grasslands is critical for reducing future greenhouse gas losses arising from land use change.&lt;/p&gt;

Review and Analysis of Actual Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soil properties of the upper soil layer determine the partitioning between infiltration, runoff, and evaporation, key processes related to soil agricultural and hydrological functioning. It is therefore important to have some information on these soil functions based on available and easy-to-measure properties. This study presents what we can learn a-priori from the soil water retention characteristic (WRC) on some important hydrological and agricultural functions. Based on a mathematical expression of the soil WRC, it is possible to estimate: the characteristic length, L-C, related to the disruption of hydraulic continuity of the water liquid phase in the soil; the saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s; the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function of water and air, K(theta(w)) and K(theta(a)); the saturation degree S-eFC at field capacity and how long it will take to reach that state; the available water content in the soil, AWC; the capillary head at the wetting front, psi(f); the infiltration capacity curve based on the Green and Ampt model, q(cap)(t); the time to ponding, t(p), for any prescribed wetting rate; the cumulative water loss during stage-1 evaporation; the duration of stage-1 evaporation. All these a-priori estimates are valuable and sometimes necessary for efficient design and planning in agricultural and hydrological applications. The values of these estimates depend upon the specific mathematical expression chosen to represent the WRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-bulk-density-fractions-explain-heterogeneity-in-global-soil-carbon-abundance-and-persistence&quot;&gt;Beyond bulk: Density fractions explain heterogeneity in global soil carbon abundance and persistence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the controls on the amount and persistence of soil organic carbon (C) is essential for predicting its sensitivity to global change. The response may depend on whether C is unprotected, isolated within aggregates, or protected from decomposition by mineral associations. Here, we present a global synthesis of the relative influence of environmental factors on soil organic C partitioning among pools, abundance in each pool (mg C g(-1) soil), and persistence (as approximated by radiocarbon abundance) in relatively unprotected particulate and protected mineral-bound pools. We show that C within particulate and mineral-associated pools consistently differed from one another in degree of persistence and relationship to environmental factors. Soil depth was the best predictor of C abundance and persistence, though it accounted for more variance in persistence. Persistence of all C pools decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) throughout the soil profile, whereas persistence increased with increasing wetness index (MAP/PET) in subsurface soils (30-176 cm). The relationship of C abundance (mg C g(-1) soil) to climate varied among pools and with depth. Mineral-associated C in surface soils (&amp;lt;30 cm) increased more strongly with increasing wetness index than the free particulate C, but both pools showed attenuated responses to the wetness index at depth. Overall, these relationships suggest a strong influence of climate on soil C properties, and a potential loss of soil C from protected pools in areas with decreasing wetness. Relative persistence and abundance of C pools varied significantly among land cover types and soil parent material lithologies. This variability in each pool’s relationship to environmental factors suggests that not all soil organic C is equally vulnerable to global change. Therefore, projections of future soil organic C based on patterns and responses of bulk soil organic C may be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-variation-in-soil-carbon-sequestration-potential-through-improved-cropland-management&quot;&gt;Global variation in soil carbon sequestration potential through improved cropland management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widespread adoption of improved cropland management measures is advocated to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thereby improving soil fertility and mitigating climate change. However, spatially explicit insight on management impacts is limited, which is crucial for region-specific and climate-smart practices. To overcome these limitations, we combined global meta-analytical results on improved management practices on SOC sequestration with spatially explicit data on current management practices and potential areas for the adoption of these measures. We included (a) fertilization practices, i.e., use of organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer or no fertilizer, (b) soil tillage practices, i.e., no-tillage relative to high or intermediate intensity tillage, and (c) crop management practices, i.e., use of cover crops and enhanced crop residue incorporation. We show that the estimated global C sequestration potential varies between 0.44 and 0.68 Gt C yr(-1), assuming maximum complementarity among all measures taken. A more realistic estimate, not assuming maximum complementarity, is from 0.28 to 0.43 Gt C yr(-1), being on the lower end of the current range of 0.1-2 Gt C yr(-1) found in the literature. One reason for the lower estimate is the limited availability of manure that has not yet been recycled. Another reason is the limited area for the adoption of improved measures, considering their current application and application limitations. We found large regional differences in carbon sequestration potential due to differences in yield gaps, SOC levels, and current practices applied. The highest potential is found in regions with low crop production, low initial SOC levels, and in regions where livestock manure and crop residues are only partially recycled. Supporting previous findings, we highlight that to encourage both soil fertility and SOC sequestration, it is best to focus on agricultural soils with large yield gaps and/or where SOC values are below levels that may limit crop production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mechanisms-of-soil-organic-carbon-stability-and-its-response-to-no-till-a-global-synthesis-and-perspective&quot;&gt;Mechanisms of soil organic carbon stability and its response to no-till: A global synthesis and perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization have been widely studied due to their relevance in the global carbon cycle. No-till (NT) has been frequently adopted to sequester SOC; however, limited information is available regarding whether sequestered SOC will be stabilized for long term. Thus, we reviewed the mechanisms affecting SOC stability in NT systems, including the priming effects (PE), molecular structure of SOC, aggregate protection, association with soil minerals, microbial properties, and environmental effects. Although a more steady-state molecular structure of SOC is observed in NT compared with conventional tillage (CT), SOC stability may depend more on physical and chemical protection. On average, NT improves macro-aggregation by 32.7%, and lowers SOC mineralization in macro-aggregates compared with CT. Chemical protection is also important due to the direct adsorption of organic molecules and the enhancement of aggregation by soil minerals. Higher microbial activity in NT could also produce binding agents to promote aggregation and the formation of metal-oxidant organic complexes. Thus, microbial residues could be stabilized in soils over the long term through their attachment to mineral surfaces and entrapment of aggregates under NT. On average, NT reduces SOC mineralization by 18.8% and PE intensities after fresh carbon inputs by 21.0% compared with CT (p &amp;lt; .05). Although higher temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) is observed in NT due to greater Q(10) in macro-aggregates, an increase of soil moisture regime in NT could potentially constrain the improvement of Q(10). This review improves process-based understanding of the physical and chemical mechanism of protection that can act, independently or interactively, to enhance SOC preservation. It is concluded that SOC sequestered in NT systems is likely to be stabilized over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bacterial-and-archaeal-taxa-are-reliable-indicators-of-soil-restoration-across-distributed-calcareous-grasslands&quot;&gt;Bacterial and archaeal taxa are reliable indicators of soil restoration across distributed calcareous grasslands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-use intensification can reduce soil carbon stocks and changes microbial community biodiversity and functionality. However, there is a lack of consensus on whether management consistently affects microbial biodiversity across geographic scales, and how this relates to altered soil function. From a regulatory and monitoring perspective, there is a need to identify functionally relevant indicators of land use in order to evaluate the progress of soil restoration approaches. We performed a landscape-scale survey of unimproved calcareous grasslands paired with local arable contrasts, and assessed the consistency of responses in a variety of soil, biotic and functional measures. In addition, adjacent grasslands undergoing restoration were assessed to identify soil microbial indicators of recovery. Organic matter content was consistently larger in grasslands than in arable fields, and increased with time in the restoring sites. Molecular comparisons of grassland versus arable soils revealed numerous bacterial, archaeal and fungal indicators, with more representatives of Ca. Xiphinematobacter, DA101, Bradyrhizobium, Rhodoplanes, Mycobacteria and Mortierella in old grassland soils, whereas Nitrososphaera, Sporosarcina and Alternaria infectoria were more abundant in arable soils. Extracellular enzymatic responses were more variable, with none of the eight investigated enzymes being consistent indicators of grassland or arable soils. Correlation analyses, incorporating the molecular and enzymatic responses across all surveyed soils, revealed that molecular indicators were more strongly correlated with soil organic matter increases with restoration of arable soils. Our results highlight that microbial taxa are among the most sensitive indicators of soil restoration, and we identify consistent responses of specific taxa to management across geographic scales. This discovery will be important for both the instigation and monitoring of soil restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil microbes are key drivers of soil ecosystem services and are affected by management&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calcareous grassland exhibited abundant Verrucomicrobia; cropping increased Nitrososphaera&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These taxa responded to SOM increases with grassland restoration, more so than enzymes and fungi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microbes provide consistent, site-independent indicators for calcareous grassland soil function restoration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-health-cluster-analysis-based-on-national-monitoring-of-soil-indicators&quot;&gt;Soil health cluster analysis based on national monitoring of soil indicators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in soil science is to monitor and understand the state and change of soils at a national scale to inform decision making and policy. To address this, there is a need to identify key parameters for soil health and function and determine how they relate to other parameters, including traditional soil surveys. Here we present a national-scale dataset of topsoil sampled as part of a wider agri-environment monitoring scheme in Wales, UK. Over 1,350 topsoils (0-15 cm) were sampled across a very wide range of habitats and a range of physical, chemical and biological soil quality indicators were measured. We show consistent differences in soil physicochemical properties across habitat types, with carbon decreasing and pH increasing across the habitat productivity gradient from bogs through woodlands and grasslands to arable systems. The soils within our dataset are largely within the limits identified as important for supporting habitat function, with the exception of excessive phosphate levels in mesotrophic grassland. Cluster detection methods identified four soil functional classes based on measured topsoil properties, which were more related to habitat type than the genesis-based soil classification from soil maps. These soil functional classes can be interpreted as phenoforms within the soil genoforms found by traditional soil classification. This shows the importance of land-use management in determining the soil health and functional capacity of soils. Our work provides an account of the current state of soil health in Wales, its relationship to soil function and a baseline for future monitoring to track changes against agri-environment and other policy targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-good-level-of-soil-organic-matter-an-index-based-on-organic-carbon-to-clay-ratio&quot;&gt;What is a good level of soil organic matter? An index based on organic carbon to clay ratio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple measures of appropriate levels of soil organic matter are needed for soil evaluation, management and monitoring, based on readily measurable soil properties. We test an index of soil organic matter based on the soil organic carbon (SOC) to clay ratio, defined by thresholds of SOC/clay ratio for specified levels of soil structural quality. The thresholds were originally delineated for a small number of Swiss soils. We assess the index using data from the initial sampling (1978-83) of the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales, covering 3,809 sites under arable land, grassland and woodland. Land use, soil type, annual precipitation and soil pH together explained 21% of the variance in SOC/clay ratio in the dataset, with land use the most important variable. Thresholds of SOC/clay ratio of 1/8, 1/10 and 1/13 indicated the boundaries between “very good”, “good”, “moderate” and “degraded” levels of structural condition. On this scale, 38.2, 6.6 and 5.6% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded. The index gives a method to assess and monitor soil organic matter at national, regional or sub-regional scales based on two routinely measured soil properties. Given the wide range of soils and land uses across England and Wales in the dataset used to test the index, we suggest it should apply to other European soils in similar climate zones. Highlights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assess the use of SOC/clay ratios as guidelines for soil management in England and Wales. We use data from 3,809 sites to assess thresholds based on work for Polish, French and Swiss soils. SOC/clay threshold values can indicate degraded and good soil structural condition. The thresholds show the effect of land use and provide an index for use in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biochar-in-climate-change-mitigation&quot;&gt;Biochar in climate change mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change mitigation strategies based on biochar generation-and its application to agricultural soils-can effectively sequester carbon, although biogeochemical and economic trade-offs must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change mitigation not only requires reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, but also withdrawal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Here we review the relationship between emissions reductions and CO2 removal by biochar systems, which are based on pyrolysing biomass to produce biochar, used for soil application, and renewable bioenergy. Half of the emission reductions and the majority of CO2 removal result from the one to two orders of magnitude longer persistence of biochar than the biomass it is made from. Globally, biochar systems could deliver emission reductions of 3.4-6.3 PgCO(2)e, half of which constitutes CO2 removal. Relevant trade-offs exist between making and sequestering biochar in soil or producing more energy. Importantly, these trade-offs depend on what type of energy is replaced: relative to producing bioenergy, emissions of biochar systems increase by 3% when biochar replaces coal, whereas emissions decrease by 95% when biochar replaces renewable energy. The lack of a clear relationship between crop yield increases in response to fertilizer and to biochar additions suggests opportunities for biochar to increase crop yields where fertilizer alone is not effective, but also questions blanket recommendations based on known fertilizer responses. Locally specific decision support must recognize these relationships and trade-offs to establish carbon-trading mechanisms that facilitate a judicious implementation commensurate with climate change mitigation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-trust-substitution-technologies-to-support-smallholder-livelihoods-in-sub-saharan-africa&quot;&gt;Digital trust substitution technologies to support smallholder livelihoods in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology has the potential to reduce the need for trust and to ensure accountability and equity in smallholder agricultural development. We present two applications - one already in progress and one hypothetical - using blockchain to address market failures in the smallholder sector in Sub-Saharan Africa. First, we explore BanQu, a blockchain-based platform used by Anheuser-Busch InBev to create verified financial identities for smallholders along the supply chain. Second, we discuss a hypothetical blockchain application to improve the reliability of actors within smallholder dairy cooperatives. Blockchain applications in smallholder agriculture could be transformative, serving as substitutes for trust, but alone blockchain is not a solution to the multiple challenges facing the smallholder farming sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;humic-substances-hypotheses-and-reality-a-review&quot;&gt;Humic Substances: Hypotheses and Reality (a Review)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term humic substances (HS) refers to a group of heterogeneous, dark-colored polydisperse substances found in soils, peats, natural waters, and sediments. It is hypothesized that HSs are formed as a result of degradation and transformation of biomolecules of organic residues and free radical condensation reactions (a process called humification). Humic substances are classified as a special category of natural compounds that are dissimilar to the biomolecules of plant and microbial tissues, and are resistant to biodegradation. On the basis of their solubility in alkalis, HSs are divided into humic acids (HAs, soluble, precipitated at pH &amp;lt; 2), fulvic acids (FAs, soluble at all pH values), and humin (insoluble residue). The review provides a critical analysis of the HS terminology and nomenclature, the method of extraction of HS from natural objects, and the hypotheses describing their formation. The ambiguity and duality of the concept of HSs (specific compounds and the sum of operational fractions) are demonstrated, as well as an arbitrary character of the division of organic matter (OM) into the dark-colored compounds of poorly defined structure (HSs) and the substances with a known structure (non-HSs). The interpretation of HSs as mass products of a secondary synthesis requires revision. The possibility of extracellular free radical reactions in soils leaves no doubt; however, a quantitative contribution of the corresponding products to the natural OM has not been established yet. The traditional alkaline extraction should be considered as a method for isolation of hydrophilic polar substances, while the precipitation with acid as their concentration for further analysis. The historical names of humic fractions (HAs, FAs, and humin) should be retained as well-established generic terms and names of the preparations obtained in a certain way without attaching unique features and specificity to all components of these fractions. The C-HA/C-FA (or C-HA/C-org) ratios are simple and convenient indicators of the types of humus reflecting bioclimatic conditions of its formation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The Four Ways to Consider Measurement Noise in Bayesian Model Selection-And Which One to Choose&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-quality-and-grain-yield-a-win-win-combination-in-clayey-tropical-oxisols&quot;&gt;Soil quality and grain yield: A win-win combination in clayey tropical oxisols&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationships between a soil quality index (SQI(FERTBIO)) and soil functions with both relative cumulative grain yields (RCY) and soil organic carbon (SOC), were evaluated in a tropical clayey Cerrado Oxisol. Soil quality (SQ) was quantified integrating chemical (FERT) and biological (BIO) indicators in a weighted-additive soil quality index combining three soil functions and respective indicators: (F1) nutrient cycling (based on the activities of soil enzymes beta-glucosidase and arylsulfatase), (F2) nutrient storage (SOC and cation exchange capacity, CEC) and (F3) nutrient supply (Ca+2, Mg+2, K+, P, pH, H + Al; Al+3, sum of bases (SB) and base saturation (%BS)). The contribution of each indicator for the related soil function was scored using standardized scoring functions (SSF) that transform the indicator value on a scale between 0 and 1. Soil samples (0 to 10 cm depth) were collected in 2013 and 2015 from 21 treatments from three long-term field experiments, with different P fertilizer management strategies. P-fertilization resulted in higher cumulative crop yields that in turn were associated with better SQI(FERTBIO) and soil functions scores. Through linear regression analyses, critical limits (CLs) to interpret the individual scores of the SQI and of the soil functions, based on RCY and SOC were defined. The proposed SQI was positively associated with RCY (p &amp;lt; 0,001; R-2 = 0,95) and SOC (p &amp;lt; 0,001; R-2 = 0,88). Similar significant relationships were found between the three soil functions and RCY or SOC. Overall, the lower and upper limits of the interpretative classes for the SQI(FERTBIO) and soil functions scores (where the index scores are equivalent, respectively, to 40% and 80% of the optimal RCY or SOC) were 0.42 and 0.64. The combination of chemical and biological indicators in different soil functions and in the SQI(FERTBIO) proved to be a simple and useful strategy to assess SQ in tropical Oxisols, linking agronomic management practices to both SQ, yield benefits and SOC. These results will help extensionists, agronomists and soil scientists, when assisting farmers, in soil health assessments, by making easier to explain the importance of SQ for the economic performance of farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protect-manage-and-then-restore-lands-for-climate-mitigation&quot;&gt;Protect, manage and then restore lands for climate mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural climate solutions, along with reduction in fossil fuel emissions, are critical to mitigating climate change and meeting climate goals. This Perspective outlines a hierarchy for decision-making regarding protecting, managing and then restoring natural systems for climate mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited time and resources remain to constrain the climate crisis. Natural climate solutions represent promising options to protect, manage and restore natural lands for additional climate mitigation, but they differ in (1) the magnitude and (2) immediacy of mitigation potential, as well as (3) cost-effectiveness and (4) the co-benefits they offer. Counter to an emerging preference for restoration, we use these four criteria to propose a general rule of thumb to protect, manage and then restore lands, but also show how these criteria explain alternative prioritization and portfolio schemes. This hierarchy offers a decision-making framework for public and private sector actors to optimize the effectiveness of natural climate solutions in an environment in which resources are constrained, and time is short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-rock-fragments-unquantified-players-in-terrestrial-carbon-and-nitrogen-cycles&quot;&gt;Soil rock fragments: Unquantified players in terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils with a significant proportion of rock fragments (RFs, with diameter &amp;gt;2 mm) are widely distributed in terrestrial ecosystems. However, a lack of quantitative information about RF characteristics restricts our ability to explain and predict the related soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) processes, and induces biases of C and N investigations in areas where soils contain significant RFs. In this paper, we reviewed the direct and indirect effects of RFs on soil C and N cycles, including via affecting soil C and N stocks, hydrology, temperature, and via chemical weathering that releases C, N, cations and anions, consumes CO2 and regulates pH. Based on this, we discussed current challenges and potential solutions in investigating C and N cycles of high RF content soils. First, we proposed a series of approaches to quantifying the effects of RFs on C and N stocks and soil hydrology across scales. Second, we emphasized the evolutions of soil RFs’ properties over time, and recommended including RF physicochemical properties in the routine soil inventory. Third, we suggested that both the effects of RFs and the evolutions of soil RFs over time should be considered in model simulation. Finally, we provided a framework by coupling monitoring, mapping and modelling to investigate the roles of RFs on soil C and N cycles from earth’s critical zone to global scale. This review will improve our understandings of RFs and terrestrial C and N cycles, and their responses to global change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distribution-of-soil-organic-matter-fractions-are-altered-with-soil-priming&quot;&gt;Distribution of soil organic matter fractions are altered with soil priming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a central role in mediating soil productivity through its impacts on nutrient cycling and retention, aggregate stability and water retention. Thus, management techniques or technologies including novel soil amendments could benefit farmers through the accumulation of carbon (C) and other nutrients in SOM. However, these same inputs can also lead to accelerated mineralization of native SOM through the process known as priming. This unresolved paradox may be due to the limited understanding of how different SOM fractions respond to priming and in which direction. In this study, we examine the response of functionally distinct SOM fractions to priming when soils are amended with lactobionate, a low molecular weight sugar acid byproduct of cheese manufacturing. Liquid-based 13C lactobionate was added to an agricultural silty loam soil to study its persistence, priming effects, and response of different SOM fractions to lactobionate over 84 days. Cumulative soil carbon dioxide (CO2) was greater in lactobionate-amended soils versus control and by the end of the experiment, 53% of added lactobionate was mineralized. In total, positive priming of 40% of extant SOM was observed from 14 to 84 days. Lactobionate-induced changes to SOM fractions were determined at days 14, 28, 56 and 84 of the incubation to examine if and how priming altered the distribution of C between fast and slowcycling SOC fractions. In response to lactobionate, the total C content of the water extractable organic matter (WEOM) fraction initially increased by 100% from the dissolved lactobionate we added, but then declined and at a faster rate than other SOM fractions. In addition, the total C of the light-fraction particulate organic matter (LFPOM) fraction also declined. At the same time, we observed total C increases in the slower-cycling sand-sized POM (H-POM) and mineral-associated organic (MAOM) C fractions, in response to lactobionate additions. We also saw a marginal increase in total soil C in the lactobionate-amended soils. Our findings therefore suggest that the application of lactobionate to soils may induce positive priming of the faster cycling LF-POM and WEOM fractions, but also concurrent gains in the H-POM and MAOM C fractions associated with long-term persistence and relative resiliency to disturbance with no net loss of total soil carbon. Thus, the application of low-molecular weight C-based materials such as lactobionate presents an avenue to building more persistent SOM through its impacts on the internal cycling and transformation of SOM fractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responses-of-soil-ph-to-no-till-and-the-factors-affecting-it-a-global-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;Responses of soil pH to no-till and the factors affecting it: A global meta-analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-till (NT) is a sustainable option because of its benefits in controlling erosion, saving labor, and mitigating climate change. However, a comprehensive assessment of soil pH response to NT is still lacking. Thus, a global meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effects of NT on soil pH and to identify the influential factors and possible consequences based on the analysis of 114 publications. When comparing tillage practices, the results indicated an overall significant decrease by 1.33 +/- 0.28% in soil pH under NT than that under conventional tillage (p &amp;lt; .05). Soil texture, NT duration, mean annual temperature (MAT), and initial soil pH are the critical factors affecting soil pH under NT. Specifically, with significant variations among subgroups, when compared to conventional tillage, the soil under NT had lower relative changes in soil pH observed on clay loam soil (-2.44%), long-term implementation (-2.11% for more than 15 years), medium MAT (-1.87% in the range of 8-16celcius), neutral soil pH (-2.28% for 6.5 &amp;lt; initial soil pH &amp;lt; 7.5), mean annual precipitation (-1.95% in the range of 600-1200 mm), in topsoil layers (-2.03% for 0-20 cm), with crop rotation (-1.98%), N fertilizer input (the same for NT and conventional tillage) of 100-200 kg N ha(-1) (-1.83%), or crop residue retention (-1.52%). Changes in organic matter decomposition under undisturbed soil and with crop residue retention might lead to a higher concentration of H+ and lower of basic cations (i.e., calcium, magnesium, and potassium), which decrease the soil pH, and consequently, impact nutrient dynamics (i.e., soil phosphorus) in the surface layer under NT. Furthermore, soil acidification may be aggravated by NT within site-specific conditions and improper fertilizer and crop residue management and consequently leading to adverse effects on soil nutrient availability. Thus, there is a need to identify strategies to ameliorate soil acidification under NT to minimize the adverse consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spatial-temporal-characteristics-of-ecosystem-health-in-central-asia&quot;&gt;Spatial-temporal characteristics of ecosystem health in Central Asia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-use/land-cover change in Central Asia has led to ecological disasters such as draining of the Aral Sea, salinization, desertification that ultimately affect the ecosystem’s health. However, only a few studies have systematically assessed the spatial-temporal characteristics of ecosystem health in Central Asia using an integrated ecosystem assessment method. Therefore, this study aims to assess the ecosystem health of Central Asia using multi-source high-resolution data as the indicator and the integrated ecosystem vigor-ecosystem organization-ecosystem elasticity (V-O-E) model. The result showed that most of the areas in Central Asia are in a weak state of ecosystem vigor, ecosystem organization, ecosystem elasticity, and ecosystem health. The fragile state of the ecosystem health was highly due to the decreasing density of forest land, farmland, waterbody, and the increasing density of bare land and artificial land. The area of farmland gradually decreased, from 878639.08 km(2) in 2000 to 719128.08 km(2) in 2010 and 584251.36 km(2) in 2017. The forest of Central Asia has been declining continuously from 161998.69 km(2) in 2000 to 115343.96 km(2) in 2010 to 81185.10 km(2) in 2017 and has become spatially heterogeneous. Interestingly, the area of forest land in Xinjiang increased from 18216.14 km(2) in 2000 to 20970.92 km(2) in 2010 and 23098.12 km(2) in 2017, although there was a decrease in the overall forest land in other countries of Central Asia; this shows that China’s afforestation and reforestation policies during the last two decades had notable contributions to the ecosystem vigor and ecosystem elasticity in Xinjiang, which led to the increase in ecosystem health in Xinjiang. Hence, it is urgent to initiate integrated water management measures, limit the population growth and take adequate measures to enhance the techniques of farmland development to enhance the ecosystem health of Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-four-ways-to-consider-measurement-noise-in-bayesian-model-selection-and-which-one-to-choose&quot;&gt;The Four Ways to Consider Measurement Noise in Bayesian Model Selection-And Which One to Choose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a statistically rigorous approach to assess the plausibility of competing models. It naturally accounts for uncertainties in models and data. In this study, we discuss the role of measurement noise in BMS deeper than in past literature. We distinguish between four cases, accounting for noise in models and/or data: (1) no-no, (2) no-yes, (3) yes-no, and (4) yes-yes. These cases differ mathematically and philosophically. Only two out of these four cases are logically consistent, and they represent two potentially conflicting research questions: “Which model is best in modeling the pure physics?” (Case 1) and “which model is best in predicting the data-generating process (i.e., physics plus noise)?” (Case 4). If we are interested in the “pure physics question,” we face two practical challenges: First, we would need noise-free data, which is impossible to obtain; and second, the numerical approximation of Bayesian model evidence can be hard when neglecting noise. We discuss how to address both challenges and reveal that a fallback to the easier “data-generation question” as a proxy for the “physics question” is not appropriate. We demonstrate on synthetic scenarios and a real-world hydrogeological case study that the choice of the case has a significant impact on the outcome of posterior model weights, and hence on results of the model ranking, model selection, model averaging, model confusion analysis, and uncertainty quantification. Reality might force us to use a different case than philosophy would suggest, and we provide guidance on how to interpret model probabilities under such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-hybrid-method-for-characterizing-tillage-induced-soil-physical-quality-at-the-profile-scale-with-fine-spatial-details&quot;&gt;A hybrid method for characterizing tillage-induced soil physical quality at the profile scale with fine spatial details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robust methods are needed to assess tillage-induced changes in the physical quality of agricultural soils. Most soil physical quality (SPQ) evaluation procedures are based on the analysis of a limited number of soil cores randomly sampled in the soil profile. Such procedures likely fail to properly capture the spatial patterns in soil structure induced by tillage implements and vehicle traffic, resulting in a misleading SPQ diagnosis. We propose a hybrid method that couples high-resolution soil penetration resistance measurements with soil core sampling to derive high-resolution data grids of SPQ indicators encompassing the soil profile structural heterogeneity. The method builds on strong experimental relationships between soil penetration resistance and bulk density, and between bulk density and the soil hydraulic properties. We tested our method on a silt-loam soil with three tillage treatments (moldboard plowing, deep loosening with a tine cultivator, and minimum tillage), each including a zone impacted by the wheel traffic. The results allow visualization and analysissis of of the effect of tillage treatments and vehicle traffic on the soil SPQ indicators with a high level of spatial detail. The proposed methodology can be used to compare various soil management techniques or to monitor the temporal evolution of SPQ. As such, it can be a valuable tool to guide agricultural soil management. Furthermore, the generated high-resolution soil physical parameter grids could be used to parameterize numerical hydrodynamic models and estimate water and solute fluxes with distributed parameters representing the actual soil profile heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-soil-moisture-based-framework-for-guiding-the-number-and-location-of-soil-moisture-sensors-in-agricultural-fields&quot;&gt;A soil moisture-based framework for guiding the number and location of soil moisture sensors in agricultural fields&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil moisture information is a key variable for guiding in-season management decisions in rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems. However, methods for deciding the number and location of soil moisture sensors (SMS) per field still remain poorly explored in the scientific literature. The goal of this study was to evaluate a quantitative framework based on soil moisture-based management zones (MZs) to determine the minimum number and tentative deployment location of SMS. Multiple spatially intensive (n &amp;gt; 100 observations) surveys of near-surface (0-12 cm) soil moisture were conducted during the fallow periods and early growing seasons of 2017, 2018, and 2019 on three agricultural fields using a calibrated handheld soil water reflectometer. The fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method was used to delineate MZs based on the soil moisture surveys, and the silhouette clustering evaluation method was used to identify the optimal number of MZs per field. Then, a sensor location index that considered the distance to the MZ boundaries and the FCM membership grade was developed to identify the tentative optimal deployment location of SMS. The proposed method effectively identified field areas with distinct soil moisture regimes and revealed the complex soil moisture spatial patterns that were not captured with elevation or soil texture alone. Dividing the fields using soil moisture-based MZ reduced the intrazone soil moisture spatial variability by about 50% compared with that of the entire field. In the three studied fields, a total of two SMS were sufficient to capture the salient soil moisture spatial regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unreconciled-effects-of-salinity-on-draining-and-wetting-functions-in-unsaturated-soils&quot;&gt;Unreconciled effects of salinity on draining and wetting functions in unsaturated soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sequence of one-step outflow-inflow experiments, this study examines the effects of salinity on soil hydraulic properties with the goal of developing a better understanding of how to predict salinity’s impacts on soils. The results of this study are compared with estimates obtained using the Hydrus-1D model for soil water and solute transport. The model assumes a decline in hydraulic conductivity (K), caused by solution chemistry, is constant over the entire hydraulic conductivity function [K(theta)] and equal to a constant reduction factor established at saturation. In contrast with the model assumptions, the results of this study show an increase in the solution chemistry’s effect on K with decreasing soil moisture (theta). These findings demonstrate that current models that exclude solution chemistry, or models that assume a constant K reduction for the entire K(theta) function, may be overestimating drainage, recharge, or bare soil evaporation. This research used undisturbed soil cores and simulated irrigation water with decreasing electrical conductivity (EC) from 20 to 0.25 dS m(-1) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) held constant. Changes in K(theta) were observed only after dropping below an EC of 1.5 dS m(-1), which is consistent with past studies. At reduced soil water contents, however, K(theta) decreased by up to five orders of magnitude relative to native soils. A second experiment was conducted that increased the SAR from 4 to &amp;gt;= 20, held EC constant at 0.65 dS m(-1), and displayed only moderate reductions in K(theta), although K was reduced proportionally more at reduced soil water contents. Therefore, based on the observed results, an integrated K(EC,theta) and K(SAR,theta) model is needed to better predict salinity effects on soil hydraulic properties and is increasingly important as freshwater resources decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empirical-assessment-of-the-relation-between-ecological-connectivity-and-land-complexity-based-on-information-theoretic-metrics&quot;&gt;Empirical assessment of the relation between ecological connectivity and land complexity based on information-theoretic metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habitat fragmentation and connectivity loss pose significant threats to biodiversity at both local and landscape levels. Strategies to increase ecological connectivity and preserve strong connectivity are important for dealing with the potential threat of habitat degradation. Various metrics have been used to measure (i.e., quantify) landscape composition and configuration in landscape ecology. However, their relationship with ecological connectivity must be understood to interpret landscape patterns comprehensively. In the present study, correlations between ecological connectivity and land complexity are examined based on information-theory metrics. Two primary questions are explored: (1) to what extent are landscape mosaic measures of entropy correlated with ecological connectivity, with landscape gradient-based measures, and with each other? (2) are landscape gradient-based entropy measures correlated with ecological connectivity more than discrete entropy measures? Results show that all information theoretic metrics are statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) for modelling ecological connectivity. Among categorically-based indices, the relationship between ECI and joint entropy was the most significant, while a generalized additive model indicated that Boltzmann entropy could predict the ecological connectivity index, explaining similar to 60% of the variance. Therefore, configurational entropy can be used for improving ecological connectivity models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enacting-theories-of-change-for-food-systems-transformation-under-climate-change&quot;&gt;Enacting theories of change for food systems transformation under climate change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, we have seen growing calls for a transformation in global food systems in response to multiple challenges, including climate change. Food systems are responsible for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activity and agricultural yields are at risk due to climate change impacts. Although many proposals have been made, there are fewer insights on what these imply for knowledge and innovation systems. We seek to advance the literature on transforming food systems under a changing climate, by identifying concrete next steps for scientists and practitioners. We do this by adapting a theory of change proposed by Campbell et al. (2018). We used the adapted theory of change to design the 5th Global Science Conference on ClimateSmart Agriculture, which brought together different stakeholders within global food systems. Through conference sessions and a survey with 262 of the participants, we validate elements of the Campbell et al. framework, identify additional elements, and offer further nuance. The findings point at nine priority areas for a transformation in food systems under climate change: (1) Empowering farmer and consumer organizations, women and youth; (2) Digitally enabled climate-informed services; (3) Climate-resilient and low-emission practices and technologies; (4) Innovative finance to leverage public and private sector investments; (5) Reshaping supply chains, food retail, marketing and procurement; (6) Fostering enabling policies and institutions; (7) Knowledge transfer; (8) Addressing fragmentation in the knowledge and innovation systems; (9) Ensuring food security. We have identified three types of scholarly insights from innovation, transition and sustainability transformations studies that may inform the next steps: these relate to stimulating novelty across the priority areas, ensuring participation in knowledge production, and reconfiguring incumbent systems to enable implementation of the theory of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-properties-sensitive-to-degradation-caused-by-increasing-intensity-of-conventional-tillage&quot;&gt;Soil properties sensitive to degradation caused by increasing intensity of conventional tillage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased conventional tillage intensity causes soil degradation in agrosystems. In this field experiment, we evaluate the sensitivity of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties under varying soil tillage intensities. The treatments were: TI0 (tillage intensity zero); TI2 (tillage intensity two); TI4 (tillage intensity four); TI6 (tillage intensity six); and TI8 (tillage intensity eight). These treatments corresponded to two tillage seasons (dry and rainy conditions) with four tillage intensities of conventional tillage (ploughing + harrowing) performed monthly. The restorative role of crop growth and rotations in soil properties was not considered in this study, and the interval between soil tillage was short. After the second tillage season, we determined 31 soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Biological properties were more affected by conventional tillage intensity than physical and chemical properties. The most sensitive soil properties to the increasing tillage intensities were aggregate weighted mean diameter (WMD), percentage of aggregates (PA), bulk density (Bd), total porosity (TP), macroporosity (Mac), microporosity (Mic), soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic matter (SOM), total microbial activity (FDA), arylsulfatase (Ary), acid phosphatase (Phos), and xylanase activity (Xyl). A minimum data set including WMD, Mac, SOM, and Xyl was suggested. The highest intensity of conventional tillage reduced WMD, Xyl and Mac by 28%, 51%, and 63%, respectively, and increased SOM by 14% relative to the control. This work may guide managers on the best soil properties for monitoring the impacts of soil tillage on soil quality in agricultural areas that routinely use conventional tillage as a management practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;influence-of-cropping-system-and-soil-type-on-soil-health&quot;&gt;Influence of cropping system and soil type on soil health&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a continued adaption and application of soil health tests across all regions of the globe; however, there are challenges related to the interpretation of the results of soil health tests developed in one region but applied elsewhere. To determine the factors that are the most important for interpreting soil health tests in Nova Scotia, a soil health database was constructed using soil samples from diverse cropping systems and soil orders in the region. The Comprehensive Assessment of Soil Health, developed at Cornell University in New York, was adapted and combined with other soil health measures. Principal component analysis ( PCA), analysis of variance, and a correlation analysis were applied to the dataset to determine if management (i.e., cropping system) or pedogenesis (i.e., soil order) was more important as a driver of soil health test results. It was determined that cropping systems explained more variance in the dataset than soil order. Although total carbon explained the most variation in the PCA, it was highly correlated to other measures of carbon such as permanganate oxidizable carbon and respiration that may be more responsive to management changes. In addition, autoclaved- citrate extractable protein, a test for nitrogen mineralization, was more related to measures of soil carbon than other measures of soil nitrogen availability. The findings of this study provide a foundation for interpreting soil health testing results for this region and will help indicate which cropping systems and soil management practices have the greatest potential for improving soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-adapted-weibull-function-for-agricultural-applications&quot;&gt;An adapted Weibull function for agricultural applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weibull function is applied extensively in the life sciences and engineering but underused in agriculture. The function was consequently adapted to include parameters and metrics that increase its utility for characterizing agricultural processes. The parameters included initial and final dependent variables (Y-0 and Y-F, respectively), initial independent variable (x(0)), a scale constant (k), and a shape constant (c). The primary metrics included mode, integral average, domain, skewness, and kurtosis. Nested within the Weibull function are the Mitscherlich and Rayleigh functions where c is fixed at 1 and 2, respectively. At least one of the three models provided an excellent fit to six example agricultural datasets, as evidenced by large adjusted coefficient of determination (R-A(2) &amp;gt;= 0.9266), small normalized mean bias error (MBEN &amp;lt;= 1.49%), and small normalized standard error of regression (SERN &amp;lt;= 8.08%). The Mitscherlich function provided the most probable (P-X) representation of corn (Zea mays L.) yield (P-M = 87.2%); Rayleigh was most probable for soil organic carbon depth profile (P-R = 96.4%); and Weibull was most probable for corn seedling emergence (P-W = 100%), nitrous oxide emissions (P-W = 100%), nitrogen mineralization (P-W = 58.4%), and soil water desorption (P-W = 100%). The Weibull fit to the desorption data was also equivalent to those of the well-established van Genuchten and Groenevelt-Grant desorption models. It was concluded that the adapted Weibull function has good potential for widespread and informative application to agricultural data and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparison-of-cornell-sprinkle-infiltrometer-and-double-ring-infiltrometer-methods-for-measuring-steady-infiltration-rate&quot;&gt;Comparison of Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer and double-ring infiltrometer methods for measuring steady infiltration rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infiltration rate measurements are used to assess soil health and develop land management practices to address runoff from precipitation and irrigation. Differences in observed infiltration rates determined by available methods can be attributed to both the technique and soil property differences. The primary objective of this study was to compare two methods for measuring steady infiltration rate: the Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer (single-ring) method (CSI), and the double-ring infiltrometer method (DRI). Measurements were made at four sites using four replications of 13 sets of conditions (52 total paired measurements). The relationship between CSI and DRI measurements was significant (p &amp;lt; .001) and strong (R-2 = .71). For 8 of 13 conditions, there was no difference between CSI and DRI steady infiltration rates. Variability in measurements was high (CVs ranged from 0.04 to 1.18) but similar for both methods. Both CSI and DRI results were strongly related to saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil layer determined using a laboratory constant head method on intact soil cores. Overall, results suggest that estimates of steady infiltration rate determined by the CSI and standard DRI methods are comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reducing-the-number-of-experiments-required-for-modelling-the-hydrocracking-process-with-kriging-through-bayesian-transfer-learning&quot;&gt;Reducing the number of experiments required for modelling the hydrocracking process with kriging through Bayesian transfer learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective is to improve the learning of a regression model of the hydrocracking process using a reduced number of observations. When a new catalyst is used for the hydrocracking process, a new model must be fitted. Generating new data is expensive and therefore it is advantageous to limit the amount of new data generation. Our idea is to use a second data set of measurements made on a process using an old catalyst. This second data set is large enough to fit performing models for the old catalyst. In this work, we use the knowledge from this old catalyst to learn a model on the new catalyst. This task is a transfer learning task. We show that the results are greatly improved with a Bayesian approach to transfer linear model and kriging model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;response-adaptive-rerandomization&quot;&gt;Response-adaptive rerandomization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rerandomization has recently attracted more attention in the literature randomized experiments. It leverages covariate information of participants to achieve a well-balanced allocation, and thus improves the efficiency of inference. However, by only considering covariate information, it may lead to potential ethical issues in clinical trials as a large number of patients might be assigned to the inferior treatment arm. To mitigate this issue, we propose a response-adaptive rerandomization scheme by incorporating response information for two-arm comparative clinical trials. Not only is our method applicable to both continuous and binary outcomes, but it also demonstrates desirable statistical and ethical properties. Extensive simulation studies are performed to illustrate the practicality and superiority of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancing-the-mechanical-and-hydraulic-properties-of-coarse-quartz-sand-using-a-water-soluble-hydrogel-based-on-bacterial-alginate-for-novel-application-in-agricultural-contexts&quot;&gt;Enhancing the mechanical and hydraulic properties of coarse quartz sand using a water-soluble hydrogel based on bacterial alginate for novel application in agricultural contexts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is generating severe changes in the physical behavior of soils (i.e., soil structure, mechanical resistance, and water conductivity), causing negative impacts on different agricultural systems and, therefore, threatening food security. To cope with this situation, hydrogels based on biopolymers have been proposed to modify the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of complex porous materials such as soils, yet most of them are nonsoluble, making their application at field level laborious. In this study, we investigated the effect of a water-soluble hydrogel based on bacterial alginate on the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of coarse quartz sand. The results from unconfined uniaxial compression test showed that the strength of the sand treated with hydrogel increased by 94.5%, whereas hydraulic conductivity decreased 33%. Interestingly, we observed that bacterial alginate and hydrogel shifted the mechanics of the fluid phase toward a Darcy regime. The aggregate stability tests showed that coarse quartz sand treated with hydrogel displays larger mean weight diameter, reaching 1.5 mm compared with 0.12 mm of the control (i.e., coarse quartz sand). Finally, transmission light microscopy imaging of the hydrogel treatment revealed a new three-dimensional matrix between the quartz sand particles, changing the microaggregates and macroaggregates and providing a modified structure of the sand material. Our findings suggest that the use of the water-soluble hydrogel improves the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of coarse quartz sand, allowing better soil conservation against climate change-related phenomena, and is also potentially applicable in agricultural systems facing water scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predicting-rootzone-soil-moisture-from-surface-observations-in-cropland-using-an-exponential-filter&quot;&gt;Predicting rootzone soil moisture from surface observations in cropland using an exponential filter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rootzone soil moisture provides valuable information to guide in-season management decisions in rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems. Measuring rootzone soil moisture usually requires the deployment of a vertical array of sensors, which can be costly and labor intensive. In this study, we tested the skill of an exponential filter to estimate rootzone soil moisture conditions from a time series of near-surface soil moisture observations. Daily soil moisture observations from a sensor at 10-cm depth were used to predict the soil water content at 30-, 50-, and 70-cm depth, and across the entire soil profile (0-to-80-cm depth) in four agricultural fields under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The characteristic time length was the only fitting parameter of the model, which was optimized for each site based on the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) score. Across the four sites, the mean NS score at individual soil layers ranged from -0.64 to 0.73, but the NS score at the profile level ranged between 0.29 and 0.84. Predictions of soil water storage at the profile level based on near-surface soil moisture and the exponential filter resulted in average RMSE of 11 mm across the four locations. Our study shows that in agricultural fields the exponential filter performs better when considering the entire soil profile rather than individual soil layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-soil-microbial-residence-time-at-the-global-scale&quot;&gt;Mapping soil microbial residence time at the global scale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil microbes are the fundamental engine for carbon (C) cycling. Microbial residence time (MRT) therefore determines the mineralization of soil organic C, releasing C as heterotrophic respiration and contributing substantially to the C efflux in terrestrial ecosystems. We took use of a comprehensive dataset (2627 data points) and calculated the MRT based on the basal respiration and microbial biomass C. Large variations in MRT were found among biomes, with the largest MRT in boreal forests and grasslands and smallest in natural wetlands. Biogeographic patterns of MRT were found along climate variables (temperature and precipitation), vegetation variables (root C density and net primary productivity), and edaphic factors (soil texture, pH, topsoil porosity, soil C, and total nitrogen). Among environmental factors, edaphic properties dominate the MRT variations. We further mapped the MRT at the global scale with an empirical model. The simulated and observed MRT were highly consistent at plot- (R-2= .86), site- (R-2 = .88), and biome- (R-2 = .99) levels. The global average of MRT was estimated to be 38 (+/- 5) days. A clear latitudinal biogeographic pattern was found for MRT with lower values in tropical regions and higher values in the Arctic. The biome- and global-level estimates of MRT serve as valuable data for parameterizing and benchmarking microbial models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;achievable-agricultural-soil-carbon-sequestration-across-europe-from-country-specific-estimates&quot;&gt;Achievable agricultural soil carbon sequestration across Europe from country-specific estimates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of soils in the global carbon cycle and in reducing GHG emissions from agriculture has been increasingly acknowledged. The ‘4 per 1000’ (4p1000) initiative has become a prominent action plan for climate change mitigation and achieve food security through an annual increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks by 0.4%, (i.e. 4 parts per thousand per year). However, the feasibility of the 4p1000 scenario and, more generally, the capacity of individual countries to implement soil carbon sequestration (SCS) measures remain highly uncertain. Here, we evaluated country-specific SCS potentials of agricultural land for 24 countries in Europe. Based on a detailed survey of available literature, we estimate that between 0.1% and 27% of the agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can potentially be compensated by SCS annually within the next decades. Measures varied widely across countries, indicating differences in country-specific environmental conditions and agricultural practices. None of the countries’ SCS potential reached the aspirational goal of the 4p1000 initiative, suggesting that in order to achieve this goal, a wider range of measures and implementation pathways need to be explored. Yet, SCS potentials exceeded those from previous pan-European modelling scenarios, underpinning the general need to include national/regional knowledge and expertise to improve estimates of SCS potentials. The complexity of the chosen SCS measurement approaches between countries ranked from tier 1 to tier 3 and included the effect of different controlling factors, suggesting that methodological improvements and standardization of SCS accounting are urgently required. Standardization should include the assessment of key controlling factors such as realistic areas, technical and practical feasibility, trade-offs with other GHG and climate change. Our analysis suggests that country-specific knowledge and SCS estimates together with improved data sharing and harmonization are crucial to better quantify the role of soils in offsetting anthropogenic GHG emissions at global level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improved-accuracy-and-reduced-uncertainty-in-greenhouse-gas-inventories-by-refining-the-ipcc-emission-factor-for-direct-n2o-emissions-from-nitrogen-inputs-to-managed-soils&quot;&gt;Improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty in greenhouse gas inventories by refining the IPCC emission factor for direct N2O emissions from nitrogen inputs to managed soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most national GHG inventories estimating direct N2O emissions from managed soils rely on a default Tier 1 emission factor (EF1) amounting to 1% of nitrogen inputs. Recent research has, however, demonstrated the potential for refining the EF1 considering variables that are readily available at national scales. Building on existing reviews, we produced a large dataset (n = 848) enriched in dry and low latitude tropical climate observations as compared to former global efforts and disaggregated the EF1 according to most meaningful controlling factors. Using spatially explicit N fertilizer and manure inputs, we also investigated the implications of using the EF1 developed as part of this research and adopted by the 2019 IPCC refinement report. Our results demonstrated that climate is a major driver of emission, with an EF1 three times higher in wet climates (0.014, 95% CI 0.011-0.017) than in dry climates (0.005, 95% CI 0.000-0.011). Likewise, the form of the fertilizer markedly modulated the EF1 in wet climates, where the EF1 for synthetic and mixed forms (0.016, 95% CI 0.013-0.019) was also almost three times larger than the EF1 for organic forms (0.006; 95% CI 0.001-0.011). Other factors such as land cover and soil texture, C content, and pH were also important regulators of the EF1. The uncertainty associated with the disaggregated EF1 was considerably reduced as compared to the range in the 2006 IPCC guidelines. Compared to estimates from the 2006 IPCC EF1, emissions based on the 2019 IPCC EF1 range from 15% to 46% lower in countries dominated by dry climates to 7%-37% higher in countries with wet climates and high synthetic N fertilizer consumption. The adoption of the 2019 IPCC EF1 will allow parties to improve the accuracy of emissions’ inventories and to better target areas for implementing mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-public-private-partnerships-in-improving-global-food-security&quot;&gt;The role of public-private partnerships in improving global food security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global food security is at a tipping point. After decades of both absolute and relative improvement in food security worldwide, climate change, market disruptions and declining productivity have reversed the trend. After four decades of improving food security, both more people and a larger portion of the global population are hungry today than in 2015. In response, researchers and their funders, governments, industries and interest groups are urging renewed collaboration and partnerships to recover and return to accelerate food production and to improve food distribution. Recently some public academics and civil society organizations are opposing these public-private partnerships (P3s). The article reviews the context, discusses the logic for P3s and explores the range of P3s that have been used and their impacts on the global agri-food system. We conclude that rather than reversing direction, the use of both strategic and tactical partnerships should be accelerated in order to improve global food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land-based-measures-to-mitigate-climate-change-potential-and-feasibility-by-country&quot;&gt;Land-based measures to mitigate climate change: Potential and feasibility by country&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-based climate mitigation measures have gained significant attention and importance in public and private sector climate policies. Building on previous studies, we refine and update the mitigation potentials for 20 land-based measures in &amp;gt;200 countries and five regions, comparing “bottom-up” sectoral estimates with integrated assessment models (IAMs). We also assess implementation feasibility at the country level. Cost-effective (available up to $100/tCO(2)eq) land-based mitigation is 8-13.8 GtCO(2)eq yr(-1) between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the IAM median and the upper end representing the sectoral estimate. The cost-effective sectoral estimate is about 40% of available technical potential and is in line with achieving a 1.5 degrees C pathway in 2050. Compared to technical potentials, cost-effective estimates represent a more realistic and actionable target for policy. The cost-effective potential is approximately 50% from forests and other ecosystems, 35% from agriculture, and 15% from demand-side measures. The potential varies sixfold across the five regions assessed (0.75-4.8 GtCO2eq yr(-1)) and the top 15 countries account for about 60% of the global potential. Protection of forests and other ecosystems and demand-side measures present particularly high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs. The feasibility assessment suggests that governance, economic investment, and socio-cultural conditions influence the likelihood that land-based mitigation potentials are realized. A substantial portion of potential (80%) is in developing countries and LDCs, where feasibility barriers are of greatest concern. Assisting countries to overcome barriers may result in significant quantities of near-term, low-cost mitigation while locally achieving important climate adaptation and development benefits. Opportunities among countries vary widely depending on types of land-based measures available, their potential co-benefits and risks, and their feasibility. Enhanced investments and country-specific plans that accommodate this complexity are urgently needed to realize the large global potential from improved land stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-soil-organic-carbon-stock-change-at-multiple-scales-using-machine-learning-and-multivariate-geostatistics&quot;&gt;Estimating soil organic carbon stock change at multiple scales using machine learning and multivariate geostatistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many national and international initiatives rely on spatially explicit information on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change at multiple scales to support policies aiming at land degradation neutrality and climate change mitigation. In this study, we used regression cokriging with random forest and spatial stochastic cosimulation to predict the SOC stock change between two years (i.e. 1992 and 2010) in Hungary at multiple aggregation levels (i.e. point support, 1 x 1 km, 10 x 10 km square blocks, Hungarian counties and entire Hungary). We also quantified the uncertainty associated with these predictions in order to identify and delimit areas with statistically significant SOC stock change. Our study highlighted that prediction of spatial totals and averages with quantified uncertainty requires a geostatistical approach and cannot be solved by machine learning alone, because it does not account for spatial correlation in prediction errors. The total topsoil SOC stock for Hungary was predicted to increase between 1992 and 2010 with 14.9 Tg, with lower and upper limits of a 90% prediction interval equal to 11.2 Tg and 18.2 Tg, respectively. Results also showed that both the predictions and uncertainties of the average SOC stock change were smaller for larger spatial supports, while spatial aggregation also made it easier to obtain statistically significant SOC stock changes. The latter is important for carbon accounting studies that need to prove in Measurement, Reporting and Verification protocols that observed SOC stock changes are not only practically but also statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-trajectory-of-soil-development-and-its-relationship-to-soil-carbon-dynamics&quot;&gt;The trajectory of soil development and its relationship to soil carbon dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been postulated that the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with soil minerals exhibits a threshold relationship in response to effective soil moisture (estimated as precipitation less evapotranspiration). To better characterize the role of moisture in influencing mechanisms of SOC storage during pedogenesis, we compare soils from two different chronosequence sites: the Santa Cruz and Mattole River marine terraces that together form a soil age-by-climate gradient (i.e., climo-chronosequence). Our results demonstrate how variation in the effective soil moisture may drive soil development along divergent pedogenic trajectories, resulting in variations in the form and depth distribution of secondary weathering products. In particular, the residual metals Fe and Al are directly related to the type of secondary minerals that accumulate during weathering, and these variations are coupled to differences in the storage and long-term preservation of SOC both within and between soils. Over time, these differences in soil development may lead to ‘pedogenic thresholds’ that further differentiate soil characteristics and influence SOC dynamics. In this case, the pedogenic threshold takes the form of clay-rich argillic horizons that once formed, inhibit aqueous transport, decouple shallow and deep soil environments, and potentially limit SOC inputs and increase microbial recycling in deep soils. Our data suggest argillic horizon development is favorable in the drier Santa Cruz soils, where kaolinite is the dominant secondary weathering product. In contrast, greater available moisture in soils of the Mattole chronosequence drive a different weathering trajectory characterized by the accumulation of more amorphous secondary minerals. As a result, the Mattole soils and do not exhibit argillic horizon development but are instead characterized by greater accumulation of SOC across all depths sampled. Overall, our results illustrate how the interaction of climate (i.e., moisture) and time may shape the trajectory of soil development and the dynamics of SOC storage and preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minimising-the-effect-of-moisture-on-soil-property-prediction-accuracy-using-external-parameter-orthogonalization&quot;&gt;Minimising the effect of moisture on soil property prediction accuracy using external parameter orthogonalization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moisture is one of the most important factors affecting soil reflectance spectra. However, provisional and dynamic behavior of soil moisture (SM) in salty soils reduce the capability of field spectrometry in the estimation of soil properties. This study aims minimising the effect of SM on the accuracy of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectra estimation of clay, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and organic carbon (OC) content in semi-arid soils by adopting External parameter orthogonalization (EPO). Spectral reflectance of disturbed soil samples was measured for seven moisture contents (i.e. air dried, 6%, 12%, 18%, 24%, 30%, and 36%) and five levels of electerical conductivity (EC) (i.e. &amp;lt; 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 dS/m). The EPO algorithm was customized for four textural classes. The performances of EPO algorithm was evaluated through partial least squares-backpropagation neural network (PLS-BPNN). The optimum number of components for the EPO matrix was determined to be four. Results showed that geometric parameters (area, depth, and width) of diagnostic absorption features (AF) in 550 nm, 2200 nm, and 2340 nm were affected by SM, and the interaction between SM and reflectance was not completely equivalent through different texture classes. The EPO correction showed an improvement of prediction accuracy of clay (RPIQ improved from 1.82 to 2.93), CaCO3 (RPIQ improved from 1.96 to 2.73), and OC (RPIQ improved from 1.94 to 3.44). Also better results have been gained by the customization of EPO for different texture classes. The performances of the EPO algorithm for clay and OC modeling dropped by increasing EC. This suggests that further studies are required to develop a method for eliminating the effects of the external parameters caused by increased salt levels in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;potential-of-visible-near-infrared-spectroscopy-for-the-determination-of-three-soil-aggregate-stability-indices&quot;&gt;Potential of visible-near infrared spectroscopy for the determination of three soil aggregate stability indices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregate stability (AS) is an important parameter to evaluate soil resistance to erosion. The conventional determination methods to measure AS are time consuming, difficult and labour intensive. Visible (vis) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy could be a better alternative to the conventional determination methods of AS. This study explored the possibilities of estimating three AS indices, reflecting stability upon slow wetting (SW), fast wetting (FW) and mechanical breakdown (MB), using vis-NIR spectra data on some air-dried, non-sieved soils of the Belgian loam belt. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to build calibration models for the three stability indices, using a calibration set accounting for 70% and a validation set of 30% of the total samples. Results showed that all three AS indices can be predicted to appreciable accuracies from vis-NIR-PLSR models [coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.72-0.80, residual prediction deviation (RPD) = 1.93-2.27, ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) = 2.23-4.09 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.29-0.52 mm]. The prediction results suggest that omission of sample pre-treatment by sieving or grinding may have very limited impact on the prediction accuracy. This opens up opportunities for the in-situ deployment of vis-NIR spectroscopy, provided that problems associated with variable soil moisture contents can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Response of global farmland soil organic carbon to nitrogen application over time depends on soil type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;response-of-global-farmland-soil-organic-carbon-to-nitrogen-application-over-time-depends-on-soil-type&quot;&gt;Response of global farmland soil organic carbon to nitrogen application over time depends on soil type&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are closely coupled to regulate the cycle of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its feedback to climate change in terrestrial ecosystem. However, the response of SOC content to N input in different soil types on time scales is still less understood. Here, we did a meta-analysis by collecting global farmland data across 60 years based on soil taxonomy, as well as our long-term field agricultural experiment from 2006 to 2019 (total number of observations, n = 301). The results showed that N addition promoted the increase of SOC content on an average of 9.1% in agrosystem, but varied considerably in different soil types (5.2%-12.0%). The SOC content of Alfisols and Mollisols soils showed a significant increasing response along the time scale. Furthermore, random forest model and structural equation model analysis indicated that climate factors and soil types indirectly affect the temporal response of SOC to N application through soil properties such as TN and C:N. This study emphasizes that the temporal response of SOC content to long-term N addition depends on soil type, with an scale-up effect in soil types with relative high SOC content (like Alfisols and Mollisols), which provides a new perspective for better understanding the C sequestration as the consequence of coupling effect of C and N in farmland system under long-term human activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-farmers-approach-soil-carbon-sequestration-lessons-learned-from-105-carbon-farming-plans&quot;&gt;How farmers approach soil carbon sequestration? Lessons learned from 105 carbon-farming plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil carbon sequestration is a recognized climate mitigation method, but it involves changes in the practices of more than 0.5 billion farms worldwide. Regionally customized carbon-farming programs are one way to tailor soil carbon storage to local conditions. We conducted farmer participatory research on 105 Finnish farms to investigate how farmers approach carbon (C) sequestration. We conducted training for farmers in the basics of carbon-farming and instructed them to make a Carbon Farming Plan for one of their fields. The plans were evaluated by a team of experts and through soil C balance calculations. In addition, potential nutrient limitations and the existing C stock were identified from soil tests. Although the existing C stocks were relatively high, an assessment of the plans indicated high potential for additional C storage (median 320 kg C ha(-1)year(-1)). The plans did not show any sensitivity to the existing C stock, with similar C inputs planned for low organic matter (OM) and high OM soils. The farmers either did not know their C stock or were not familiar with the C balance concept. Most soil samples showed considerable nutrient deficiencies (P, S, B and Mn), which can limit C storage. The quality of most plans was adequate for research with minor modifications. The largest C storage potential was estimated for measures with large additions of nutrient-poor amendments or in grazing. Most farmers chose measures with relatively low C storage benefits but high potential benefits for soil structure and productivity (cover crops, nutrient-rich amendments, grassland management). The C gain from some measures (subsoiling, diversity in grasslands) could not be estimated with current methodologies. The magnitude of planned C storage over 5 years on most farms was so small (&amp;lt;0.5% OM), that it is challenging to measure it through soil sampling. This finding supports the earlier conclusions that a combination of modeling and soil sampling is needed to verify the C storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sequestration-of-soil-carbon-by-burying-it-deeper-within-the-profile-a-theoretical-exploration-of-three-possible-mechanisms&quot;&gt;Sequestration of soil carbon by burying it deeper within the profile: A theoretical exploration of three possible mechanisms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsoil carbon is generally older and decomposes more slowly than topsoil carbon. It has, therefore, been suggested that carbon stocks could be increased by burying carbon-rich topsoil at depth to slow its decomposition. This has been supported by recent experiments that showed that buried topsoil carbon indeed decomposed more slowly, but the mechanisms causing the reduction have not yet been identified. We investigated three theoretical mechanisms that may explain reduced decomposition rates at depth: (1) lower soil-temperature variability, (2) lower oxygen concentrations/redox potential and (3) less priming (biological synergy). Temperature variability decreases with soil depth. As decomposition rates vary non-linearly with temperature, reduced temperature variability should, therefore, reduce annual decomposition rates. However, detailed simulations showed that it changed annual decomposition rates by only a few percent. Maximal decomposition rates also require adequate oxygen, but our simulations showed that oxygen diffusion rates would need to be reduced 1000 to 10 000-fold compared to the topsoil for it to protect buried soil carbon. Oxygen limitation is, therefore, likely to be confined to soils that are water-logged for extended periods. Priming (or biological synergy) is assumed to be the stimulation of decomposition rates by the availability of labile organic carbon. Our simulations showed that lower labile carbon inputs could reduce priming and potentially preserve up to half of buried carbon for centuries. If experimental work can further substantiate the role of this mechanism, carbon burial at depth could become a practical and useful climate-change mitigation option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-abuse-of-popular-performance-metrics-in-hydrologic-modeling&quot;&gt;The Abuse of Popular Performance Metrics in Hydrologic Modeling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this commentary is to critically evaluate the use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. We focus on the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics, which are both widely used in hydrologic research and practice around the world. Our specific objectives are: (a) to provide tools that quantify the sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics; (b) to quantify sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics across a large sample of catchments; and (c) to prescribe the further research that is, needed to improve the estimation, interpretation, and use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. Our large-sample analysis demonstrates that there is substantial sampling uncertainty in the NSE and KGE estimators. This occurs because the probability distribution of squared errors between model simulations and observations has heavy tails, meaning that performance metrics can be heavily influenced by just a few data points. Our results highlight obvious (yet ignored) abuses of performance metrics that contaminate the conclusions of many hydrologic modeling studies: It is essential to quantify the sampling uncertainty in performance metrics when justifying the use of a model for a specific purpose and when comparing the performance of competing models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-classification-a-new-approach-for-grouping-soils-using-unsaturated-hydraulic-conductivity-data&quot;&gt;Soil Classification: A New Approach for Grouping Soils Using Unsaturated Hydraulic Conductivity Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grouping soils based on similarities in their textural, taxonomic, and/or structural properties has broad applications to pedology, hydrology, and soil science. In this study, we present a new approach for classifying soils using hydraulic conductivity data. We apply concepts from critical path analysis and calculate critical pore sizes at various water saturations from the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves. Soils with similar critical pore size at the same effective water saturation are then grouped into the same class. To demonstrate the practical application of the proposed soil classification method, we use 102 samples including nine soil textures from the UNSODA database. Applying a curve clustering method, we find eight different soil classes within the studied data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predicting-characteristics-of-the-water-cycle-from-scaling-relationships&quot;&gt;Predicting Characteristics of the Water Cycle From Scaling Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over multi-decadal time scales, assuming that changes in subsurface water storage are negligible, the continental precipitative water flux, P, can be divided into two principal components, Q (run-off, including soil infiltration and groundwater recharge) and ET (evapotranspiration). Taking into account a broadly applied Budyko’s phenomenology to describe the relationship of ET/P as a function of PET/P, where PET is the potential evapotranspiration, we propose a theoretical framework for predicting characteristics of the water cycle from scaling relationships. In this framework, the ecosystem net primary productivity is expressed in terms of soil formation and vegetation growth, which is mathematically optimized with respect to the water partitioning, generating directly the value ET/P. The mathematical optimization is based on the general ecological principle that dominant ecosystems tend to be those that, for any given conditions, maximize conversion of atmospheric carbon to biomass. It is shown that application of the results of mathematical optimization to water-limited ecosystems is possible by applying the optimization only to a vegetation covered portion of the surface. For energy-limited ecosystems, the optimization can be applied only to a portion of the precipitation equal to PET, assuming that the remaining P simply runs off. We use theoretical and actual values of plant root fractal dimensionalities, d(f), to predict ranges of ET/P as a function of PET/P for 0 &amp;lt;= PET/P &amp;lt;= 1 and compare with annual and multi-decadal means of ET/P. By comparing the developed approach with a large amount of data collected from the literature, we demonstrate its successful applications to both water- and energy-limited systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-transfer-function-to-predict-soil-surface-reflectance-from-laboratory-soil-spectral-libraries&quot;&gt;A transfer function to predict soil surface reflectance from laboratory soil spectral libraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectral-based models extracted from laboratory reflectance in the 400-2500 nm spectral range to predict soil attributes may not be applicable to soil spectra acquired in the field. This is because laboratory sampling procedures disturb the natural soil surface’s status. We investigated this issue by using the soil surface-dependent property of water-infiltration rate (WIR). We created a dataset with 114 samples collected from six fields with varying textures located in three different Mediterranean countries (Israel, Greece, Italy). Using the field and laboratory spectral datasets, we demonstrated that WIR is better predicted by field vs. laboratory measurements (R-2 = 0.92 and 0.56, respectively). We also developed a transfer function (TF) to predict the field spectral measurements from the laboratory spectra. Use of the TF-processed dataset considerably improved the WIR prediction using laboratory information (from R-2 = 0.56 to 0.76). It was concluded that soil surface reflectance values can be estimated based on laboratory spectra using a TF. The generated TF enables exploiting soil spectral libraries for remote-sensing views and for assessing surface-related soil properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-carbonate-absorbance-peak-to-select-the-most-suitable-regression-model-before-predicting-soil-inorganic-carbon-concentration-by-mid-infrared-reflectance-spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Using carbonate absorbance peak to select the most suitable regression model before predicting soil inorganic carbon concentration by mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-Infrared reflectance spectroscopy (MIRS, 4000-400 cm(-1)) is being considered to provide accurate estimations of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) contents, based on prediction models when the test dataset is well represented by the calibration set, with similar SIC range and distribution and pedological context. This work addresses the case where the test dataset, here originating from France, is poorly represented by the calibration set, here originating from Tunisia, with different SIC distributions and pedological contexts. It aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of 1) classifying test samples according to SIC level based on the height of the carbonate absorbance peak at 2510 cm(-1), and then 2) selecting a suitable prediction model according to SIC level. Two regression methods were tested: Linear Regression using the height of the carbonate peak at 2510 cm(-)(1), called Peak-LR model; and Partial Least Squares Regression using the entire MIR spectrum, called Full-PLSR model. First, our results showed that Full-PLSR was 1) more accurate than Peak-LR on the Tunisian validation set (R-val(2) = 0.99 vs. 0.86 and RMSEval = 3.0 vs. 9.7 g kg(-1) , respectively), but 2) less accurate than Peak-LR when applied on the French dataset (R-test(2) = 0.70 vs. 0.91 and RMSEtest = 13.7 vs. 4.9 g kg(-1), respectively). Secondly, on the French dataset, predictions on SIC-poor samples tended to be more accurate using Peak-LR, while predictions on SIC-rich samples tended to be more accurate using Full-PLSR. Thirdly, the height of the carbonate absorbance peak at 2510 cm(-1) might be used to discriminate SIC-poor and SIC-rich test samples (&amp;lt;5 vs. &amp;gt; 5 g kg(-1)): when this height was &amp;gt; 0, Full-PLSR was applied; otherwise Peak-LR was applied. Coupling Peak-LR and Full-PLSR models depending on the carbonate peak yielded the best predictions on the French dataset (R-test(2) = 0.95 and RMSEtest = 3.7 g kg(-1)). This study underlined the interest of using a carbonate peak to select suitable regression approach for predicting SIC content in a database with different distribution than the calibration database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monitoring-soil-organic-matter-on-grassland-farms-an-exploratory-analysis&quot;&gt;Monitoring soil organic matter on grassland farms: An exploratory analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet the goals of the Climate Agreement, policy makers consider incentivizing soil carbon sequestration by carbon credits to offset greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, industry and other sectors. Therefore, the interest in monitoring soil organic matter dynamics is growing rapidly, yet factors affecting the precision of the monitoring results are rarely quantified. We used the rhetorical scheme “The seven circumstances” to structure the methodological aspects of setting up a soil organic matter (SOM) monitoring program. The rhetorical scheme was applied during four years on two grass-based dairy farms in the Netherlands to assess in detail: conversion of SOM weight concentrations to SOM stocks (HOW), the effect of soil depth and the integration of scales field vs. farm (WHERE), and the effect of sampling date and sampling frequency on SOM estimates (WHEN). We found that all three circumstances affect conclusions on SOM stocks or SOM dynamics strongly. Considerable variation was found in the relationship between soil bulk density and SOM weight concentration (i.e. pedotransfer curves) among fields, depth and literature reference equations. Therefore, preferably a site specific pedotransfer curve should be used when comparing SOM stocks based on SOM weight concentrations across sites. Large differences in trends of SOM stock changes over time were found between fields and sampling depths. We conclude that a sampling depth in grassland soils up to 60 cm may be relevant to capture the dynamics in deeper layers. Furthermore, for quantitative underpinning of carbon payment schemes, the whole farm should be monitored rather than a few fields as trends between fields are highly variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-integrated-approach-for-the-evaluation-of-quantitative-soil-maps-through-taylor-and-solar-diagrams&quot;&gt;An integrated approach for the evaluation of quantitative soil maps through Taylor and solar diagrams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many decades, soil scientists have produced spatial estimates of soil properties using statistical and non-statistical mapping models. Commonly in soil mapping studies the map quality is assessed through pairwise comparison of observed and predicted values of a soil property, from which statistical indices summarizing the quality of the entire map are computed. Often these indices are based on average error and correlation statistics. In this study, we recommend a more appropriate and effective method of map evaluation by means of Taylor and solar diagrams. Taylor and solar diagrams are summary diagrams exploiting the relationship between statistical indices to visualize differentiable aspects of map quality into a single plot. An important advantage over current map quality evaluation is that map quality can be assessed from the combined effect of a few statistical quantities, not just on the basis of a single index or list of indices. We illustrate the use of common statistical indices and their combination into summary diagrams with a simulation study and two applications on soil data. In the simulation study nine maps with known statistical properties are produced and evaluated with tables and summary diagrams. In the first case study with soil data, change in the quality of a large-scale topsoil organic carbon map is tracked for a number of permutations in the mapping model parameters, whereas in the second case study several maps of topsoil organic carbon content for the same area, made by various statistical and non-statistical models, are compared and evaluated. We consider that in all cases better insights in map quality are obtained with summary diagrams, instead of using a single index or an extensive list of indices. This underpins the importance of using integrated summary graphics to communicate on quantitative map quality so as to avoid excessive trust that a single map quality index may suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;achieving-joint-calibration-of-soil-vis-nir-spectra-across-instruments-soil-types-and-properties-by-an-attention-based-spectra-encoding-spectraproperty-decoding-architecture&quot;&gt;Achieving joint calibration of soil Vis-NIR spectra across instruments, soil types and properties by an attention-based spectra encoding-spectra/property decoding architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the differences in instruments and measurement methods, soil visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectral data collected worldwide cannot be combined to provide consistent calibration models, reducing the benefit of producing soil spectra libraries. We propose an attention-based spectra encoding-spectra/property decoding model for soil Vis-NIR spectral analysis to solve this problem. By introducing the attention mechanism, the model can use the same parameters to achieve a joint calibration regardless of the length of the input spectral data and the type of soil samples. The model design pays attention to wavelengths combination, which accords to the essence of Vis-NIR analysis. Three datasets, including the LUCAS, Brazilian, and Kenyan datasets, were used to train and test the attention model. An alternative convolution neural network (CNN) encoding architecture that allows joint calibration was also introduced. Comparing with conventional partial least squares regression (PLSR) and CNN encoding model, the present attention model obtained the best results on all three datasets. This is the first time that an attention-based model has been applied to soil Vis-NIR spectra analysis. The model can process spectra data with different sizes and focus on the relation between different wavelengths, providing a joint calibration. It has the potential to become a “one model for all” in soil Vis-NIR spectra research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bayesian-approach-for-sample-size-determination-illustrated-with-soil-health-card-data-of-andhra-pradesh-india&quot;&gt;Bayesian approach for sample size determination, illustrated with Soil Health Card data of Andhra Pradesh (India)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crucial decision in designing a spatial sample for soil survey is the number of sampling locations required to answer, with sufficient accuracy and precision, the questions posed by decision makers at different levels of geographic aggregation. In the Indian Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, many thousands of locations are sampled per district. In this paper the SHC data are used to estimate the mean of a soil property within a defined study area, e.g., a district, or the areal fraction of the study area where some condition is satisfied, e.g., exceedence of a critical level. The central question is whether this large sample size is needed for this aim. The sample size required for a given maximum length of a confidence interval can be computed with formulas from classical sampling theory, using a prior estimate of the variance of the property of interest within the study area. Similarly, for the areal fraction a prior estimate of this fraction is required. In practice we are uncertain about these prior estimates, and our uncertainty is not accounted for in classical sample size determination (SSD). This deficiency can be overcome with a Bayesian approach, in which the prior estimate of the variance or areal fraction is replaced by a prior distribution. Once new data from the sample are available, this prior distribution is updated to a posterior distribution using Bayes’ rule. The apparent problem with a Bayesian approach prior to a sampling campaign is that the data are not yet available. This dilemma can be solved by computing, for a given sample size, the predictive distribution of the data, given a prior distribution on the population and design parameter. Thus we do not have a single vector with data values, but a finite or infinite set of possible data vectors. As a consequence, we have as many posterior distribution functions as we have data vectors. This leads to a probability distribution of lengths or coverages of Bayesian credible intervals, from which various criteria for SSD can be derived. Besides the fully Bayesian approach, a mixed Bayesian-likelihood approach for SSD is available. This is of interest when, after the data have been collected, we prefer to estimate the mean from these data only, using the frequentist approach, ignoring the prior distribution. The fully Bayesian and mixed Bayesian-likelihood approach are illustrated for estimating the mean of log-transformed Zn and the areal fraction with Zn-deficiency, defined as Zn concentration &amp;lt;0.9 mg kg(-1), in the thirteen districts of Andhra Pradesh state. The SHC data from 2015-2017 are used to derive prior distributions. For all districts the Bayesian and mixed Bayesian-likelihood sample sizes are much smaller than the current sample sizes. The hyperparameters of the prior distributions have a strong effect on the sample sizes. We discuss methods to deal with this. Even at the mandal (sub-district) level the sample size can almost always be reduced substantially. Clearly SHC over-sampled, and here we show how to reduce the effort while still providing information required for decision-making. R scripts for SSD are provided as supplementary material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quantification-of-soil-organic-carbon-at-regional-scale-benefits-of-fusing-vis-nir-and-mir-diffuse-reflectance-data-are-greater-for-in-situ-than-for-laboratory-based-modelling-approaches&quot;&gt;Quantification of soil organic carbon at regional scale: Benefits of fusing vis-NIR and MIR diffuse reflectance data are greater for in situ than for laboratory-based modelling approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits of fusion approaches for visible to near (vis-NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) chemometric modelling have been studied to some extent for laboratory-based soil studies, but little is known about the usefulness and limitations for in situ studies. Objectives were to compare laboratory-based and in situ vis-NIR and MIR partial least squares (PLS) and bagging-PLS regression approaches and to explore the potentials of combining both types of spectral data for the quantification of soil organic carbon (SOC). We applied different established low-level (spectra concatenation, outer product fusion approach) and high-level (averaging of vis-NIR and MIR modelling results) data fusion methods. The studied set comprised a total of 186 soil samples collected in SaxonyAnhalt and northern Saxony, Central Germany. One subset (Querfurt Plateau) covered 90 finely-textured soils originating from the Chernozem soil region, another (Diiben Heath) with 96 samples was characterized by a wider pedological variety. Vis-NIR and MIR diffuse reflectance spectra were measured in situ on the soil surface and in the laboratory on pre-treated (dried and finely ground) soil material with the ASD FieldSpec 4 and the Agilent 4300 Handheld FTIR instruments. We found a regionally stratified approach to be beneficial for accurate estimations for both laboratory and in situ data. For laboratory spectra, MIR outperformed vis-NIR data in both regions (Querfurt Plateau: r(2) = 0.85 vs. 0.65, RMSE = 0.11 (in % SOC) vs. 0.17; Diiben Heath: 0.77 vs. 0.69 (r(2)) and 0.27 vs. 0.40 (RMSE)). Ranking for in situ data was the same, but accuracies decreased markedly. With MIR, r(2) amounted to 0.58 and RMSE was 0.20 for the Querfurt Plateau (vis-NIR: r(2) = 0.26, RMSE = 0.27); for Diiben Heath, r(2) was 0.60 and RMSE was 0.39 for MIR data, while vis-NIR resulted in an r(2) of 0.53 and an RMSE of 0.43. For the studied samples, which had medium to low water contents (0.68 to 16.8 wt%, median at 5.4 wt%), we found accuracies with both spectral datasets to be similarly affected by in situ conditions. Model ensemble averaging based on bagging-PLS regression was the most efficient approach to improve SOC estimation accuracies with in situ spectral data, whereas model averaging was in general of little effect for laboratory data. Improvements were most marked for the in situ data of the Diiben Heath region, where r(2) increased to a value of 0.77 and RMSE decreased to 0.28. Low-level data fusion methods did not yield any improvements compared to model ensemble averaging. For the latter, we identified averaging with weights derived sample-wise from uncertainties in the bootstrap-based modelling as being most accurate, but with little benefits compared to a simple (unweighted) averaging of vis-NIR and MIR estimates. Our results suggest that already a simple averaging procedure has the potential to advance multi-sensor applications integrating vis-NIR and MIR data for in situ or on-site soil spectroscopy. This applies especially to regions with heterogeneous soil conditions, tied to spectral variablity, as this increases the probability of complementary vis-NIR and MIR information and their prospective fusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-effectiveness-of-digital-soil-mapping-with-temporal-variables-in-modeling-soil-organic-carbon-changes&quot;&gt;The effectiveness of digital soil mapping with temporal variables in modeling soil organic carbon changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of using changes in environmental conditions to explain the spatiotemporal variability in soil organic carbon (SOC) with digital soil mapping (DSM) requires investigation. In this study, temporal variables representing temporal patterns of climate, vegetation, and land cover factors were explored. Models to predict SOC stocks were developed using a random forest algorithm and data from China during two periods (the 1980s and 2010s). We forecasted and hindcasted the developed models and assessed their temporal projections against temporally independent data. Models were developed for both periods using different sets of variables (with/without temporal variables), and their temporal projections were compared. The important temporal variables were identified by applying the recursive feature elimination algorithm. The results showed that the performances of temporal projections for the 1980s and 2010s were improved by approximately 17% and 47%, respectively, when temporal variables were included in the models. Spatially, the maps of changes in SOC stocks derived from the models that included temporal variables presented stronger associations with temporal changes in climate, vegetation, and land cover than those derived from the models that did not include temporal variables. This work highlights that variation in SOC stocks can be linked to temporal patterns of environmental factors. The findings also provide evidence that the application of temporal patterns of environmental factors to DSM models can be useful for the large-scale prediction of changes in SOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;statistical-inference-for-trends-in-spatiotemporal-data&quot;&gt;Statistical inference for trends in spatiotemporal data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global change analyses are facilitated by the growing number of remote-sensing datasets that have both broad spatial extent and repeated observations over decades. These datasets provide unprecedented power to detect patterns of time trends involving information from all pixels on a map. However, rigorously testing for time trends requires a solid statistical foundation to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses. Appropriate statistical analyses are challenging because environmental data often have temporal and spatial autocorrelation, which can either obscure underlying patterns in the data or suggest false associations between patterns in the data and independent values used to explain them. Existing statistical methods that account for temporal and spatial autocorrelation are not practical for remote-sensing datasets that often contain millions of pixels. Here, we first analyze simulated data to show the need to account for both spatial and temporal autocorrelation in time-trend analyses. Second, we present a new statistical approach, PARTS (Partitioned Autoregressive Time Series), to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses about time trends using all pixels in large remotesensing datasets. PARTS is flexible and can include, for example, the effects of multiple independent variables, such as land-cover or latitude, on time trends. Third, we use PARTS to analyze global trends in NDVI, focusing on trends in pixels that have not experienced land-cover change. We found that despite the appearance of overall increases in NDVI in all continents, there is little statistical support for these trends except for Asia and Europe, and only in some land-cover classes. Furthermore, we found no overall latitudinal trend in greening for any continent, but some latitude by land-cover class interactions, implying that latitudinal patterns differed among land-cover classes. PARTS makes it possible to identify patterns and test hypotheses that involve the aggregate information from many pixels on a map, thereby increasing the value of existing remote-sensing datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land-use-change-and-biodiversity-challenges-for-assembling-evidence-on-the-greatest-threat-to-nature&quot;&gt;Land-use change and biodiversity: Challenges for assembling evidence on the greatest threat to nature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-use change is considered the greatest threat to nature, having caused worldwide declines in the abundance, diversity, and health of species and ecosystems. Despite increasing research on this global change driver, there are still challenges to forming an effective synthesis. The estimated impact of land-use change on biodiversity can depend on location, research methods, and taxonomic focus, with recent global meta-analyses reaching disparate conclusions. Here, we critically appraise this research body and our ability to reach a reliable consensus. We employ named entity recognition to analyze more than 4000 abstracts, alongside full reading of 100 randomly selected papers. We highlight the broad range of study designs and methodologies used; the most common being local space-for-time comparisons that classify land use in situ. Species metrics including abundance, distribution, and diversity were measured more frequently than complex responses such as demography, vital rates, and behavior. We identified taxonomic biases, with vertebrates well represented while detritivores were largely missing. Omitting this group may hinder our understanding of how land-use change affects ecosystem feedback. Research was heavily biased toward temperate forested biomes in North America and Europe, with warmer regions being acutely underrepresented despite offering potential insights into the future effects of land-use change under novel climates. Various land-use histories were covered, although more research in understudied regions including Africa and the Middle East is required to capture regional differences in the form of current and historical land-use practices. Failure to address these challenges will impede our global understanding of land-use change impacts on biodiversity, limit the reliability of future projections and have repercussions for the conservation of threatened species. Beyond identifying literature biases, we highlight the research priorities and data gaps that need urgent attention and offer perspectives on how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predicting-ecosystem-responses-by-data-driven-reciprocal-modelling&quot;&gt;Predicting ecosystem responses by data-driven reciprocal modelling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment effects are traditionally quantified in controlled experiments. However, experimental control is often achieved at the expense of representativeness. Here, we present a data-driven reciprocal modelling framework to quantify the individual effects of environmental treatments under field conditions. The framework requires a representative survey data set describing the treatment (A or B), its responding target variable and other environmental properties that cause variability of the target within the region or population studied. A machine learning model is trained to predict the target only based on observations in group A. This model is then applied to group B, with predictions restricted to the model’s space of applicability. The resulting residuals represent case-specific effect size estimates and thus provide a quantification of treatment effects. This paper illustrates the new concept of such data-driven reciprocal modelling to estimate spatially explicit effects of land-use change on organic carbon stocks in European agricultural soils. For many environmental treatments, the proposed concept can provide accurate effect size estimates that are more representative than could feasibly ever be achieved with controlled experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-layer-high-resolution-soil-moisture-estimation-using-machine-learning-over-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Multi-layer high-resolution soil moisture estimation using machine learning over the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of proper understanding of multi-layer soil moisture (SM) profile (signals) remains a persistent challenge in sustainable agricultural water management and food security, especially during drought conditions. We develop a machine-learning algorithm using the concept of learning from patterns to estimate the multi-layer SM information in ungauged locations firmly based on local knowledge of the climatic and landscape controls. The Contiguous United States (CONUS) is clustered into homogeneous regions based on the association between SM and climate and landscape controls. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is applied to homogenous regions to capture the complex relationship between appropriate predictor variables and in-situ SM at multiple layers over the CONUS. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 (L4) surface (0-5 cm) and rootzone (0-100 cm) SM along with climate and landscape datasets are used as predictor variables. In-situ multi-layer SM recorded by Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN), Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL), and U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) networks are utilized as predictands. XGBoost models are then trained region-wise and layer-wise to estimate multi-layer SM information at 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm depths (five layers) at 1-km spatial resolution. Results indicate that the predictor variables have varying levels of influence on SM with changing soil depth, and meteorological variables have the least importance. Validation at 79 independent locations indicates the multi-layer SM estimates successfully capture temporal dynamics of SM, with most locations achieving ubRMSE less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3). The high-resolution SM estimates offer spatial sub-grid heterogeneity compared to SMAP L4 SM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sentinel-1-soil-moisture-at-1-km-resolution-a-validation-study&quot;&gt;Sentinel-1 soil moisture at 1 km resolution: a validation study&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study presents an assessment of a pre-operational soil moisture product at 1 km resolution derived from satellite data acquired by the European Radar Observatory Sentinel-1 (S-1), representing the first space component of the Copernicus program. The product consists of an estimate of surface soil volumetric water content Theta [m(3)/m(3)] and its uncertainty [m(3)/m(3)], both at 1 km. The retrieval algorithm relies on a time series based Short Term Change Detection (STCD) approach, taking advantage of the frequent revisit of the S-1 constellation that performs C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. The performance of the S-1 Theta product is estimated through a direct comparison between 1068 S-1 Theta images against in situ Theta measurements acquired by 167 ground stations located in Europe, America and Australia, over 4 years between January 2015 and December 2020, depending on the site. The paper develops a method to estimate the spatial representativeness error (SRE) that arises from the mismatch between the S-1 Theta retrieved at 1 km resolution and the in situ point-scale Theta observations. The impact of SRE on standard validation metrics, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation (R) and linear regression, is quantified and experimentally assessed using S-1 and ground Theta data collected over a dense hydrologic network (4-5 stations/km(2)) located in the Apulian Tavoliere (Southern Italy). Results show that for the dense hydrological network the RMSE and correlation are similar to 0.06 m(3)/m(3) and 0.71, respectively, whereas for the sparse hydrological networks, i.e., 1 station/km(2), the SRE increases the RMSE by similar to 0.02 m(3)/m(3) (70% Confidence Level). Globally, the S-1 Theta product is characterized by an intrinsic (i.e., with SRE removed) RMSE of similar to 0.07 m(3)/m(3) over the Theta range [0.03, 0.60] m(3)/m(3) and R of 0.54. A breakdown of the RMSE per dry, medium and wet Theta ranges is also derived and its implications for setting realistic requirements for SAR-based Theta retrieval are discussed together with recommendations for the density of in situ Theta observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-monitoring-nitrous-oxide-sources-min2os-satellite-project&quot;&gt;The Monitoring Nitrous Oxide Sources (MIN2OS) satellite project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monitoring Nitrous Oxide Sources (MIN2OS) satellite project aims at monitoring global-scale nitrous oxide (N2O) sources by retrieving N2O surface fluxes from the inversion of space-borne N2O measurements that are sensitive to the lowermost atmospheric layers under favorable conditions. MIN2OS will provide emission estimates of N2O at a horizontal resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees on the global scale and 10 x 10 km(2) on the regional scale on a weekly to monthly basis depending on the application (e.g., agriculture, national inventories, policy, scientific research). Our novel approach is based on the development of: 1) a space-borne instrument operating in the Thermal InfraRed domain providing, in clear sky conditions, N2O mixing ratio in the lowermost atmosphere (900 hPa) under favorable conditions (summer daytime) over land and under favorable and unfavorable (winter nighttime) conditions over the ocean and 2) an atmospheric inversion framework to estimate N2O surface fluxes from the atmospheric satellite observations. After studying three N2O spectral bands (B1 at 1240-1350 cm(-1), B2 at 2150-2260 cm(-1) and B3 at 2400-2600 cm(-1)), a new TIR instrument will be developed, centered at 1250-1330 cm(-1), with a resolution of 0.125 cm(-1), a Full Width at Half Maximum of 0.25 cm(-1) and a swath of 300 km. To optimally constrain the retrieval of N2O vertical profiles, the instrument will be on-board a platform at-830 km altitude in a sun-synchronous orbit crossing the Equator in descending node at 09:30 local time in synergy with two other platforms (Metop-SG and Sentinel-2 NG) expected to fly in 2031-32 aiming at detecting surface properties, agricultural information on the field scale and vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents and temperature. The lifetime of the MIN2OS project would be 4-5 years to study the interannual variability of N2O surface fluxes. The spectral noise can be decreased by at least a factor of 5 compared to the lowest noise accessible to date with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer-New Generation (IASI-NG) mission. The N2O total error is expected to be less than similar to 1% (similar to 3 ppbv) along the vertical. The preliminary design of the MIN2OS project results in a small instrument (payload of 90 kg, volume of 1200 x 600 x 300 mm(3)) with, in addition to the spectrometer, a wide field and 1-km resolution imager for cloud detection. The instruments could be hosted on a small platform, the whole satellite being largely compatible with a dual launch on VEGA-C. The MIN2OS project has been submitted to the European Space Agency Earth Explorer 11 mission ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;carbon-myopia-the-urgent-need-for-integrated-social-economic-and-environmental-action-in-the-livestock-sector&quot;&gt;Carbon myopia: The urgent need for integrated social, economic and environmental action in the livestock sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Livestock have long been integral to food production systems, often not by choice but by need. While our knowledge of livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation has evolved, the prevailing focus has been-somewhat myopically-on technology applications associated with mitigation. Here, we (1) examine the global distribution of livestock GHG emissions, (2) explore social, economic and environmental co-benefits and trade-offs associated with mitigation interventions and (3) critique approaches for quantifying GHG emissions. This review uncovered many insights. First, while GHG emissions from ruminant livestock are greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC; globally, 66% of emissions are produced by Latin America and the Caribbean, East and southeast Asia and south Asia), the majority of mitigation strategies are designed for developed countries. This serious concern is heightened by the fact that 80% of growth in global meat production over the next decade will occur in LMIC. Second, few studies concurrently assess social, economic and environmental aspects of mitigation. Of the 54 interventions reviewed, only 16 had triple-bottom line benefit with medium-high mitigation potential. Third, while efforts designed to stimulate the adoption of strategies allowing both emissions reduction (ER) and carbon sequestration (CS) would achieve the greatest net emissions mitigation, CS measures have greater potential mitigation and co-benefits. The scientific community must shift attention away from the prevailing myopic lens on carbon, towards more holistic, systems-based, multi-metric approaches that carefully consider the raison d’etre for livestock systems. Consequential life cycle assessments and systems-aligned ‘socio-economic planetary boundaries’ offer useful starting points that may uncover leverage points and cross-scale emergent properties. The derivation of harmonized, globally reconciled sustainability metrics requires iterative dialogue between stakeholders at all levels. Greater emphasis on the simultaneous characterization of multiple sustainability dimensions would help avoid situations where progress made in one area causes maladaptive outcomes in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-accumulation-of-microbial-necromass-carbon-from-litter-to-mineral-soil-and-its-contribution-to-soil-organic-carbon-sequestration&quot;&gt;The accumulation of microbial necromass carbon from litter to mineral soil and its contribution to soil organic carbon sequestration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microbial necromass plays an essential role in soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation. Nevertheless, how microbial necromass carbon (C) concentrations and their contributions to SOC sequestration change from litter to mineral soil and what factors influence its accumulation remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a field experiment to investigate the compositional distribution characteristics of microbial necromass C and its contributions to SOC sequestration in an oak forest (Quercus wutaishanica) litter-mineral soil profile of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The present study estimated the microbial necromass C concentrations based on the microbial cell wall’s biomarker amino sugars. Our results demonstrated that microbial necromass C increased from the Oi1 to Oa layers but decreased from the Ah1 to AB horizons. The highest accumulation of microbial necromass C was found at the litter-mineral soil interface (i.e., total microbial necromass in the Oa layer was 39.5 Mg ha(-1), and Ah1 was 22.8 Mg ha(-1)). The contribution of total microbial necromass C to SOC increased from Oi1 to Ah2. Specifically, the total microbial necromass C accounted for 40.7%, 47.7%, and 37.0% of the average bulk SOC in the Ah1, Ah2, and AB horizons of the oak forest mineral soil, respectively. The ratio of fungal to bacterial necromass C decreased from litter to mineral soil, indicating that the relatively higher bacterial necromass C increasingly accumulated in the deeper litter layers and upper mineral soil horizons. Fungal and bacterial necromass C increased with increasing labile organic C, nitrogen (N), and labile inorganic phosphorus (P), suggesting that higher easily accessible soluble nutrients lead to higher microbial biomass levels, which in turn lead to higher microbial necromass accumulation. Overall, our findings suggested that microbial demand for C or N influences the quantity of soluble nutrients and further lead to changes in microbial necromass C decomposition/accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how topography affects the distribution of soil properties is essential in the management of landscape hydrology and establishment of sustainable soil management practices. This study investigated the impact of topography on the variation in particle size distribution, coarse fragments, and soil bulk density using different interpolation techniques and fractal analysis. It also evaluated the performance of various interpolation techniques in predicting and characterizing the distribution of soil properties. The study was conducted using data from 620 samples extracted from the Tellus and LUCAS databases in Eglinton and Castlederg counties, Northern Ireland. Terrain attributes were obtained at a 30 x 30 m resolution using a global digital elevation model (GDEM) reintroduced to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. Interpolation analyses were conducted using inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), block kriging (BK) and co-kriging (CK). Among the terrain attributes, elevation was the most influential covariate for CK. In addition, fractal analysis was conducted to assess the self-similarity of the soil properties. Prediction accuracy of the interpolation methods was evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, mean absolute error, index of agreement, and Pearson correlation coefficient. Spatial maps produced from the kriging techniques showed high accuracy in the prediction of soil particle size distribution and bulk density. The use of elevation as an auxiliary variable was successful in producing accurate soil property distribution maps with CK. The fractal parameters showed that the soil properties had short range spatial variability, anti-persistent nature, and strong spatial structure. Additionally, the fractal dimension was strongly correlated with sand, silt and clay contents and bulk density, and weakly correlated with the coarse fragments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;characterization-of-soil-drainage-using-electromagnetic-induction-measurement-of-soil-magnetic-susceptibility&quot;&gt;Characterization of soil drainage using electromagnetic induction measurement of soil magnetic susceptibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a physical property of soil, magnetic susceptibility (MS) has been widely used to delineate soil drainage conditions over the past two decades, where all MS values were derived from laboratory measurements. In this paper, the ability of an electromagnetic induction (EMI) instrument, Geonics EM38, in in-field measurements of apparent magnetic susceptibility (MSa or.a) of topsoil was tested on six selected soil profiles having different drainage conditions. The MSa data, measured in both vertical and horizontal coil configurations of EM38, were then inverted using an iterative 1-D inversion procedure to calculate real volume MS of soil layers up to 1 m depth. Moreover, volume and mass-specific MS of the soil profiles were directly measured in laboratory by employing Bartington MS2C and MS2B sensors applied on core and dried soil samples, respectively, collected at the soil profiles. Comparing the results revealed that volume MS profiles derived from inversion of MSa data were positively correlated with MS profiles measured in laboratory, especially at topsoil. It was also found that MS values in poorly drained soil profile were lower than those of a well-drained profile. So, considering that EMI methods are fast, precise and cost-efficient, they would be preferred over conventional methods for delineating soil drainage conditions if using soil MS assessment is considered as soil drainage criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-sensors-based-profile-heterogeneity-index-for-soil-characterization&quot;&gt;A sensors-based profile heterogeneity index for soil characterization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technological and computational development has raised new possibilities for soil scientists to describe and infer about soil-forming processes and functions. Thus, why not to insert the contrasts between soil layers in a profile revealed by proximal sensing? We proposed to study the soil profile heterogeneity by reflectance (Vis-NIR-SWIR), X-ray fluorescence and magnetic susceptibility aiming to quantify it with the proposed “Profile Heterogeneity Index” (PHI) through seven soil sequences in twenty-seven locations over different hillslope positions and parent materials. The study was conducted in a 165-ha farm, at Rio das Pedras municipality, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The differences between two consecutive soil layers were calculated by subtracting the data to the bottom and the immediately above for each soil profile. The results are depicted as a depth function with proportional colors to highlight the heterogeneity in the soil profiles. This approach provided a new method to identify where the transitions of soil attributes occur exactly and improve the understanding about soil-formation factors and processes. In this study, greater PHI values were mainly related to erosion and redeposition process through the landscape, differences in soil parent materials and also soil-forming processes. The sensors can furnish important and complementary information to the characterization of soil profile heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transfer-functions-for-phosphorus-and-potassium-soil-tests-and-implications-for-the-quefts-model&quot;&gt;Transfer functions for phosphorus and potassium soil tests and implications for the QUEFTS model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-element soil extractions such as Mehlich 3 (M3) have gained popularity in recent years, but comparing outcomes to other soil testing methods is not always straightforward. In this study, extraction mechanisms of M3, Olsen and neutral 1 M ammonium acetate (AA) soil tests were explored and transfer functions were derived between P-Olsen and P-M3 as well as between K-AA and K-M3. Soils from tropical and temperate areas were used to derive these P and K transfer functions and were evaluated separately. The application of these transfer functions for tropical soils was evaluated by using them as input for the Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils (QUEFTS). AA and M3 generally extracted similar amounts of K, but relations between K-AA and K-M3 were different for tropical and temperate soils. For tropical soils, the transfer function did not require additional parameters besides K-M3 to predict K-AA, but for temperate soils inclusion of clay content and pH was needed. This difference between tropical and temperate soils was explained by clay mineralogy. The relation between P-Olsen and P-M3 in tropical soils was found to be dependent on pH, Al-M3, Fe-M3 and Ca-M3. P-Olsen and K-AA values, calculated with their respective transfer functions, were used as input for QUEFTS. The yields predicted with measured P-Olsen and Exch. K were used as benchmark. For 63 out of 81 soil samples, predicted maize yields with transfer functions deviated less than 10% from the benchmark. The largest deviations from the benchmark were found for low P-Olsen and K-AA values, which corresponds to QUEFTS maize yield predictions up to 3000 kg ha(-1). We conclude that a M3 extraction results and soil pH can reliably be transferred to, and thus replace P-Olsen and K-AA determinations with the functions developed for tropical soils. The transfer functions can be used to generate input for the QUEFTS model with minor effects on yield predictions, thus expanding its applicability in cases where only M3 extraction results are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-spike-or-to-localize-strategies-to-improve-the-prediction-of-local-soil-properties-using-regional-spectral-library&quot;&gt;To spike or to localize? Strategies to improve the prediction of local soil properties using regional spectral library&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of soil spectral libraries are being developed at larger extents, including at national, continental, and global scales. However, the prediction accuracy of these libraries was often fairly poor when used on local scales. This study evaluates different strategies to improve the model accuracy of a regional spectral library for soil organic carbon prediction in four different local target areas. In total, five strategies using the Partial least squares regression (PLSR) were compared, including the use of local, spiked-regional, spiked-subsetregional and two localized models (memory based learning (MBL) and localized PLSR). MBL derives a new local prediction model based on a subset of the regional spectra similar to the new sample to be predicted. A localized PLSR calibrates a linear regression model using projected scores of the local samples derived from a pre-trained regional PLSR model. Validation results showed that the performances of the spiked models were not much better than those derived from the local and localized models. With &amp;gt;20 local samples, the localized PLSR model performed better than both the local and spiked-regional models. MBL model achieved similar performance to the localized PLSR model. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the models was heavily affected by both the spectral similarity of the data and the statistics of the predictand. Therefore, we recommend localizing the prediction models. Our results also suggest that spiking affected the regression coefficients of the PLSR models but not the loadings, which enabled the compression of spectra data into informative PLS scores. If the local spectra have low similarity to the regional spectral library, building a local spectral library would be more beneficial, assuming the sample size is large enough (&amp;gt;30).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rapid-assessment-of-soil-water-repellency-indices-using-vis-nir-spectroscopy-and-pedo-transfer-functions&quot;&gt;Rapid assessment of soil water repellency indices using Vis-NIR spectroscopy and pedo-transfer functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil water repellency (SWR) is an important soil physical property that may restrict water infiltration and soil water retention. Common laboratory and field techniques for assessing SWR are laborious, time-consuming, and costly. Meanwhile, Visible-Near-Infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy has been reported as a rapid, cost-effective, and alternative technique to estimate several soil properties. To investigate the efficacy of this technique for predicting SWR indices [soil water repellency index (RI) and soil-water contact angle (beta)] at dry condition, 100 soil samples collected from farmlands, orchards, rangelands and forests of Zrebar lake watershed in Kurdistan province, Iran, were measured by Vis-NIR spectroscopy within the 350-2500 nm range. The Savitzky-Golay first derivative method was applied for denoising the spectral data. The RI and beta were measured by the intrinsic sorptivity method (using water and ethanol as absorbing liquids). The other basic soil properties were also measured by standard laboratory methods. Stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were utilized to establish pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) and spectro-transfer functions (STFs) using basic soil properties and spectral absorbance data, respectively, to estimate soil organic matter (SOM) content and SWR indices. We obtained good predictions for SOM with R-2 = 0.67 and RPIQ (the ratio of performance to interquartile range) = 1.92 using the PLSR-based STF. The results also revealed that although the SMLR-based STFs achieved slightly better estimates of the SWR indices (RI and beta) than the SMLR-based PTFs (R-2 values of 0.28 to 0.39 vs. 0.19 to 0.23, respectively); but, overall, none of these transfer functions for estimating these indices showed acceptable predictive capability. However, the PLSR-based STFs could provide a reasonable prediction for the studied SWR indices (R-2 &amp;gt; 0.52 and RPIQ &amp;gt; 2.27). The majority of important adsorption bands in the Vis-NIR PLSR models for the SWR prediction was related to both the quantity and quality of SOM. Overall, the results demonstrated that the Vis-NIR PLSR could be applied to predict SOM and SWR indices rapidly, non-destructively, and with fair accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;provoking-a-cultural-shift-in-data-quality&quot;&gt;Provoking a Cultural Shift in Data Quality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecological studies require quality data to describe the nature of ecological processes and to advance understanding of ecosystem change. Increasing access to big data has magnified both the burden and the complexity of ensuring quality data. The costs of errors in ecology include low use of data, increased time spent cleaning data, and poor reproducibility that can result in a misunderstanding of ecosystem processes and dynamics, all of which can erode the efficacy of and trust in ecological research. Although conceptual and technological advances have improved ecological data access and management, a cultural shift is needed to embed data quality as a cultural practice. We present a comprehensive data quality framework to evoke this cultural shift. The data quality framework flexibly supports different collaboration models, supports all types of ecological data, and can be used to describe data quality within both short- and long-term ecological studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-carbon-sequestration-potential-and-the-identification-of-hotspots-in-the-eastern-corn-belt-of-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Soil carbon sequestration potential and the identification of hotspots in the eastern Corn Belt of the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil C sequestration is a significant CO2 mitigation strategy, but precise assessments of sequestration require spatially explicit modeling of potential changes in soil organic C (SOC) in response to soil, climate, land condition, and management interactions. We assessed the SOC sequestration potential of the eastern Corn Belt (ECB) in the United States (Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia) in response to the adoption of conservation farming practices and land use change (pasture and forestation) using the SOCRATES model. Input data was provided through an intersection of the State Soil Geographic database, National Land Cover Database, and a PRISM (https://prism.oregonstate.edu) climate surface. At the end of the 20th century, the 15.3 Mha of cropped soils in the ECB contained 632 Tg C, an estimated reduction of 52% since the introduction of agriculture in the mid 1800s. Complete adoption of no-tillage practices on prime cropland would potentially recover 147 Tg SOC over 20 yr, whereas a continuation of conventional tillage would produce a loss of 35 Tg SOC over that period. Sequestration hotspots (&amp;gt;500 Gg increase in SOC) under no-tillage cover 2.3 Mha providing 28 Tg C over 20 yr. The conversion of marginal (nonprime) agricultural lands to forests would yield an additional 13 Tg C in SOC and 381 Tg C in aboveground biomass. The rehabilitation of minelands to forest would yield an additional 4 Tg C in SOC and 42 Tg C in biomass. Opportunities to sequester C in the ECB via tillage and reforestation are substantial and should be incorporated into regional and national climate change mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sensitivity-and-variability-of-soil-health-indicators-in-a-california-cropping-system&quot;&gt;Sensitivity and variability of soil health indicators in a California cropping system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An indicator that is used to monitor whether a management practice is improving soil health must be sensitive to management changes. However, it should not be overly influenced by variations in sampling time or location, previous crop, or annual differences in weather or operations timing. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity and variability of several soil health indicators in long-term plots under typical farming practices in a Mediterranean climate. These plots have been conventionally or organically farmed in a corn (Zea mays L.)-processing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) rotation for 25 yr. We sampled in both crop phases prior to planting and midseason for two consecutive years, analyzing subsamples taken from three adjacent locations per plot. Management was the most significant factor differentiating most indicators, particularly indicators of biological processes and C accumulation. Whereas management differences were consistent across sampling times, average indicator values for a management system often varied significantly between dates and years. Crop phases, conversely, were usually similar. Accounting for soil texture increased management sensitivity for aggregate stability and most C accumulation indicators. Sensitive indicators such as mineral N, particulate organic matter C, and mineralizable C had greater subsample variability than indicators measuring large, stable pools, such as total C. Our results show that indicators relating to organic C and biological processes most strongly differentiated the two systems, and underline the importance of using consistent sampling dates. They also suggest that an indicator dataset including both stable and sensitive indicators may be the most reliable to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relating-indicators-to-soil-health-functions-in-conventional-and-organic-mediterranean-cropping-systems&quot;&gt;Relating indicators to soil health functions in conventional and organic Mediterranean cropping systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurate assessment of the benefits of soil health building practices to soil function and crop performance requires region-specific data and locally relevant indicators. In this study, we used a long-term experiment to measure the effect of 25 yr of differing management on soil health and crop performance indicators in organic and conventionally farmed annual crops in a Mediterranean climate. We measured the strength and consistency of the relationships between several indicators and three functions of a healthy agroecosystem-C storage, net N mineralization, and yields-over two growing seasons and two crop types. Lastly, we used path analysis to test the hypothesis that healthier soils lead to healthier plants and higher yields. Organic plots had greater C stocks and net N mineralization compared with the conventional plots, but lower yields. The path analysis suggested that yields were limited by factors other than N deficiency. The relationships between soil health indicators and soil function were unaffected by crop type but were moderated by yearly changes in weather and operations timing. The indicators most strongly and consistently related to C stocks were permanganate oxidizable C and microbial biomass C, and to N mineralization were CO2 mineralized from rewet soil and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. Our results highlight that (a) different indicators are appropriate for assessing different aspects of soil health, (b) using several years of data in developing robust ranges for indicator interpretation is important, and (c) links between soil and crop health must be assessed mechanistically within a given system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;satellite-earth-observation-to-support-sustainable-rural-development&quot;&gt;Satellite Earth observation to support sustainable rural development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional survey and census data are not sufficient for measuring poverty and progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Satellite Earth Observation (EO) is a novel data source that has considerable potential to augment data for sustainable rural development. To realise the full potential of EO data as a proxy for socioeconomic conditions, end-users - both expert and non-expert - must be able to make the right decisions about what data to use and how to use it. In this review, we present an outline of what needs to be done to operationalise, and increase confidence in, EO data for sustainable rural development and monitoring the socioeconomic targets of the SDGs. We find that most approaches developed so far operate at a single spatial scale, for a single point in time, and proxy only one socioeconomic metric. Moreover, research has been geographically focused across three main regions: West Africa, East Africa, and the Indian Subcontinent, which underscores a need to conduct research into the utility of EO for monitoring poverty across more regions, to identify transferable EO proxies and methods. A variety of data from different EO platforms have been integrated into such analyses, with Landsat and MODIS datasets proving to be the most utilised to-date. Meanwhile, there is an apparent underutilisation of fusion capabilities with disparate datasets, in terms of (i) other EO datasets such as RADAR data, and (ii) non-traditional datasets such as geospatial population layers. We identify five key areas requiring further development to encourage operational uptake of EO for proxying socioeconomic conditions and conclude by linking these with the technical and implementational challenges identified across the review to make explicit recommendations. This review contributes towards developing transparent data systems to assemble the high-quality data required to monitor socioeconomic conditions across rural spaces at fine temporal and spatial scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-overview-of-agriculture-40-development-systematic-review-of-descriptions-technologies-barriers-advantages-and-disadvantages&quot;&gt;An overview of agriculture 4.0 development: Systematic review of descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture 4.0 upgrades traditional production methods and world agriculture strategies to an optimized value chain using a range of emerging technologies that enhance disruptive solutions at all stages of the agricultural production chain. Due to the complexity of the changing farm ecosystem, the new technological revolution’s benefits will not be shared evenly. It is necessary to understand the problems and challenges that need to be addressed so that all countries fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0. This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study’s findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0. Besides, research helps broaden the inclusive debate that can shape the introduction of agriculture 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-sustainable-is-sustainable-intensification-assessing-yield-gaps-at-field-and-farm-level-across-the-globe&quot;&gt;How sustainable is sustainable intensification? Assessing yield gaps at field and farm level across the globe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainable intensification has been proposed as a pathway to achieve food security and reduce environmental impacts of agriculture by focusing on narrowing yield gaps on existing agricultural land while improving resource use efficiencies. There is a general consensus that regions with large yield gaps can benefit most from sustainable intensification but it remains unclear how sustainable this is for farmers given their current resource constraints and livelihood strategies. Here, we draw upon three contrasting case studies, for which detailed data at field and farm levels were available for yield gap decomposition, to assess how sustainable intensification of crops (at field level) works out at farm level using environmental and socio-economic indicators. Although there is large potential for future intensification (more output with more input) of cereal production in southern Ethiopia, current input use in these farming systems is not economically and environmentally sustainable at farm level. The same is true for rice production in Central Luzon where sustainable intensification (more output with less input) can help to narrow yield gaps and improve N use efficiency (NUE) but it is not profitable due to the heavy reliance on costly hired labour. Trade-offs between yield gap closure and labour productivity were also observed in the aforementioned farming systems. Arable farms in the Netherlands exhibit small yield gaps as well as higher economic performance, NUE and N surplus compared to those observed in Southern Ethiopia and Central Luzon. For improving environmental sustainability, these farms require increases in resource-use efficiency and a reduction of the environmental impacts through a lower use of inputs (same output with less input). We conclude that public investments conducive for innovation and profitable farming are essential to make technologies accessible and affordable for farmers and to ensure that yield gaps can be narrowed and sustainability objectives served at the farm level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additive-effects-of-organic-and-inorganic-amendments-can-significantly-improve-structural-stability-of-a-sodic-dispersive-subsoil&quot;&gt;Additive effects of organic and inorganic amendments can significantly improve structural stability of a sodic dispersive subsoil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sodic dispersive subsoils pose significant constraints to agricultural productivity and sustainability in arid and semiarid regions. Gypsum and organic amendments (OAs) have shown the potential to improve soil structure and fertility and may address constraints associated with these dispersive soils. However, the mechanistic linkages between the quality of OAs, and the dynamics of soil structural stability (i.e., soil aggregates), particularly under the interactive impacts of gypsum and exogenous nutrients, remain elusive. We quantified aggregate stability (i.e., wet mean weight diameter, WMWD) and the accumulation of OA-carbon (C) in different aggregate-classes in a dispersive clay subsoil (delta C-13 -24.5 parts per thousand) with or without the application of OAs (delta C-13 -12.8 to -14.3 parts per thousand), gypsum and/or exogenous nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) over the 270 days incubation period. The OAs include sorghum stubble and sugarcane bagasse that were low C quality (e.g., C:N:P ratio of 328:6.2:1 and 850:17.3:1, respectively) and less decomposed (e.g., low alkyl-C/o-alkyl-C ratio), and sugarcane mill mud that was high C quality (C:N:P ratio of 17:1.4:1) and more decomposed status. The results suggest that the quality of OAs is likely to control the dominant mechanisms of soil aggregation: (i) a quick top-down formation of aggregate hierarchy (similar to 31 days) in the low C quality and less decomposed OAs; and (ii) a slow bottom-up formation of aggregate hierarchy (&amp;gt;= 90 days) in the high C-quality and more decomposed OA. Over time, lowering the C-nutrient stoichiometric ratio of OAs (via exogenous nutrients) decreased aggregate stability by 30%, owing to accelerated breakdown/loss of OAs (i.e., by 16%). The exchangeable Ca2+ (from gypsum) was positively correlated to WMWD and water stable aggregates (&amp;gt;0.05 mm), which were not influenced by OAs or nutrients. In this dispersive clay subsoil, a long-term positive effect on soil aggregation occurred when improving either biochemical properties (e.g., microbial biomass and soil organic C) or chemical properties (e.g., soil dispersion, exchangeable sodium percentage, and pH), and an additive effect appeared when both properties were changed. This study provides critical information on the effects of OAs with variable C qualities, gypsum, and nutrients on structural stability with insights into strategies of sodic subsoil amelioration and soil C storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-biochar-application-alleviate-soil-compaction-review-and-data-synthesis&quot;&gt;Does biochar application alleviate soil compaction? Review and data synthesis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biochar is considered to enhance numerous soil ecosystem services, but whether it alleviates soil compaction is not well known. This paper: 1) synthesizes the biochar impacts on soil compaction parameters including bulk density, penetration resistance, aggregate tensile strength, Proctor maximum bulk density (soil compactability), and the water content at which the Proctor maximum bulk density occurs (critical water content), 2) discusses potential factors affecting biochar performance, and 3) compares the impacts of biochar on soil compaction with those of other amendments. Literature indicates that biochar generally reduces bulk density, tensile strength, and Proctor maximum bulk density; and increases the critical water content but may or may not reduce penetration resistance. Biochar reduces bulk density from 1% to 20% (-8.8% average), tensile strength from 8 to 72% (-31% average), and Proctor maximum bulk density from 1 to 19% (-9.3% average), whereas it increases the critical water content from 1 to 64% (21% average). The increase in critical water content suggests soils with biochar can be trafficked at higher water content without causing compaction than soils without biochar. An increase in biochar application rate reduces soil compaction and explains 11% to 63% of the variability in compaction parameters, but biochar benefits can be short-lived (&amp;lt;2 yr). It appears that, in general, at least 10 Mg ha 1 of biochar are needed to significantly reduce compaction. Larger application rates (&amp;gt;20 Mg ha 1) can be needed for reducing penetration resistance and Proctor maximum bulk density than for other compaction parameters. Biochar has similar benefits to manure for reducing soil bulk density and can complement other organic amendments for reducing soil compaction. How biochar feedstock, pyrolysis temperature; and companion amendments; and soil texture influence biochar impacts on compaction is still unclear. Overall, biochar has the potential to alleviate soil compaction, but more long-term field data, particularly on penetration resistance, Proctor maximum bulk density, and critical water content for multiple biochar application rates, feedstocks, pyrolysis temperature; and amendments are needed to better elucidate biochar effects, biochar longevity, and optimum levels of biochar application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-standardize-by-mass-of-soil-or-organic-carbon-a-comparison-of-permanganate-oxidizable-carbon-poxc-assay-methods&quot;&gt;To standardize by mass of soil or organic carbon? A comparison of permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) assay methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) as a soil health indicator has gained traction due to its low analysis cost and potential for high-throughput analysis. Permanganate (MnO4-) has long been proposed to fractionate soil organic matter. A methodological alteration was proposed to allow for its use as a rapid soil health indicator (POXC) is to allow the MnO4- to reach with a fixed soil mass, rather than a fixed mass of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, this modification may compromise the robustness of the results by altering the consistency of the stoichiometry in the reduction-oxidation reaction (MnO4- : SOC). Here we use a diverse set of 69 U.S. soils to evaluate whether using a fixed soil mass (2.5 g) substantively undermines the theoretical requirement of a fixed amount of SOC (15 or 25 mg SOC per sample) per unit of oxidant (MnO4-). We found that the use of a fixed SOC mass entailed a more consistent reduction of MnO4- than a fixed soil mass and also resulted in a greater range of absolute (mg kg(-1)) and relative POXC values (as a % of SOC) across soils. This broader range of values was not driven by large differences in the amount of MnO4- reduced per unit of SOC analyzed, but rather resulted from normalizing the amount of MnO4- reduced on a soil mass basis. The underlying distribution of MnO4- reduction did not substantively change, suggesting that the interpretation when comparing relative differences in POXC would similarly be unchanged. Unexpectedly, the use of a fixed SOC mass decreased the repeatability of the metric relative to the use of a fixed soil mass. Given the current interpretation of POXC, we see few upsides of using fixed SOC mass and several downsides (i.e. lower throughput and decreased reliability), relative to the current use of a fixed soil mass. To minimize unfounded assumptions, we further propose that POXC values be reported strictly as MnO4- reduced, specifically as mu mol MnO4- reduced kg(-1) soil. Our results further underscore that the results of POXC assays should be cautiously interpreted. Specifically, interpretations should be qualified by the operationally-defined nature of the POXC assay as an indirectly measured, chemically defined fraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spatial-extrapolation-of-topographic-models-for-mapping-soil-organic-carbon-using-local-samples&quot;&gt;Spatial extrapolation of topographic models for mapping soil organic carbon using local samples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurate prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) at fine scales is frequently limited by data availability but finescale maps of soil properties are often of great importance for local agricultural land management and watershed processes assessment. Terrain attributes derived from elevation have been commonly used predictor variables in SOC mapping. The aim of this study is to map SOC density (0-30 cm) using hybrid methods that combine regional topographic models and a residual kriging procedure using local samples from an area of interest and evaluate the effects of different sampling designs for residual kriging on final map quality. The regional topographic model was developed based on light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived topographic covariates using random forest to map SOC density on a cropland site intensively sampled for SOC (n = 224). To test ability to generate a local calibration of this regional model, a second intensively sampled cropland site (n = 225) was used to generate a reference SOC density map where residual kriging was implemented involving different numbers of local samples (n = 10-255) and different sample selection schemes: stratified random sampling (SRS) and spatial coverage sampling with close-pairs inclusions (SCS+). To generate a population of local sample sets, 500 repeats were conducted for each scheme from the reference map. By analyzing the distribution of relative mean error (RME) of the overall map for the second site with repeated selection of local samples, we found a smaller variation in RME for SCS+ than that for SRS for a given sample size. However, the E(RME) estimates for SCS+ slightly varied with number of local samples used while the E(RME) for SRS was stabilized at zero over that range in local sampling intensity. There was negligible difference between the distributions of RME for the two sampling schemes at individual points, except a finding of somewhat lower RME for SCS+ based point estimates. These results indicate that SCS+ can generate smaller variation in overall map quality while SRS can provide unbiased mean estimate for an area of interest. This study demonstrates the utility of extrapolating a regional topographic model by use of a limited number of new samples for local calibration and provides insight for practitioners who are interested in mapping soil carbon distribution in sparsely sampled areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empirical-estimation-of-soil-temperature-and-its-controlling-factors-in-australia-implication-for-interaction-between-geographic-setting-and-air-temperature&quot;&gt;Empirical estimation of soil temperature and its controlling factors in Australia: Implication for interaction between geographic setting and air temperature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil temperature is a key parameter affecting changes in the balance among energy flow, water flow, nutrient cycling, and ecological stability. In previous research on soil temperature estimation, field measurement has been valuable. However its value is uncertain for regional scale research. A regression equation algorithm approach introduces the environmental factors into consideration. The correlations between soil temperature and environmental covariates may not be linear, and most of them conform to a parabolic relationship. Therefore, based on 53 years’ data (1958-2010) from 140 meteorological stations in Australia, this study applied a 3-parameter cosine wave model to fit the monthly air and soil temperature. Further, this study identified the correlations between the parameters and landscape factors using stepwise regression. The root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The results showed that: (1) The cosine-wave function can effectively identify the monthly air/soil temperature fluctuation and the prediction accuracy increases gradually from north to south in Australia. (2) The precipitation, horizontal irradiation and elevation are predominant factors that affecting soil temperature fluctuation given a defined air temperature fluctuation. (3) Landscape factors regulate the hysteresis of air/soil temperature fluctuation. The hysteresis of soil temperature response to air temperature in Australia is in order of duration: central &amp;gt; south &amp;gt; north. Therefore, the application of the cosine function is a useful and novel technique for estimation of soil temperature, which could provide better understanding of how soil temperature fluctuation responds to the global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;classification-segmentation-and-correlation-of-zoned-minerals&quot;&gt;Classification, segmentation and correlation of zoned minerals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals exhibit compositional zoning patterns that can be related to changes in the environment in which they grew. Using statistical methods that have been designed to segment optical images, we have developed a procedure to segment zoned crystals using elemental maps. For a single mineral phase, compositional zones in individual crystals are correlated between multiple crystals. This allows us to quantify the complexity and variability of chemical zoning between different geological samples. Specifically, we employ a simple linear iterative clustering algorithm, which splits the chemical maps into spatially constrained regions of similar chemistry. The result is a texturally segmented crystal, akin to what would be identified by the human eye. To aid the segmentation and correlation of zones, we also introduce a new method to classify multiple mineral phases within a single thin section. This is based on a finite mixture model approach, which proves very effective in removing mixed pixels that will only introduce noise into the segmentation. We provide an example using the mineral phase plagioclase. Using two contemporaneous samples from an eruptive unit on the island of St. Kitts (Eastern Caribbean) we show that a volcanic bomb (-10 cm) and a scoria clast (-2 cm) have similar rim compositions but distinctly different core compositions. Our methodology will enable a statistical characterization of 2D complexity of crystals in a variety of different geo-scientific disciplines. This will allow the genesis of different mineral phases to be directly compared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-observed-soil-heterotrophic-respiration-fluxes-as-a-novel-constraint-on-global-scale-models&quot;&gt;Leveraging observed soil heterotrophic respiration fluxes as a novel constraint on global-scale models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microbially explicit models may improve understanding and projections of carbon dynamics in response to future climate change, but their fidelity in simulating global-scale soil heterotrophic respiration (R-H), a stringent test for soil biogeochemical models, has never been evaluated. We used statistical global R-H products, as well as 7821 daily site-scale R-H measurements, to evaluate the spatiotemporal performance of one first-order decay model (CASA-CNP) and two microbially explicit biogeochemical models (CORPSE and MIMICS) that were forced by two different input datasets. CORPSE and MIMICS did not provide any measurable performance improvement; instead, the models were highly sensitive to the input data used to drive them. Spatial variability in R-H fluxes was generally well simulated except in the northern middle latitudes (similar to 50 degrees N) and arid regions; models captured the seasonal variability of R-H well, but showed more divergence in tropic and arctic regions. Our results demonstrate that the next generation of biogeochemical models shows promise but also needs to be improved for realistic spatiotemporal variability of R-H. Finally, we emphasize the importance of net primary production, soil moisture, and soil temperature inputs, and that jointly evaluating soil models for their spatial (global scale) and temporal (site scale) performance provides crucial benchmarks for improving biogeochemical models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;important-constraints-on-soil-organic-carbon-formation-efficiency-in-subtropical-and-tropical-grasslands&quot;&gt;Important constraints on soil organic carbon formation efficiency in subtropical and tropical grasslands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 10% of Australia’s 49 M ha of grassland is considered degraded, prompting widespread interest in the management of these ecosystems to increase soil carbon (C) sequestration-with an emphasis on long-lived C storage. We know that management practices that increase plant biomass also increase C inputs to the soil, but we lack a quantitative understanding of the fate of soil C inputs into different soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions that have fundamentally different formation pathways and persistence in the soil. Our understanding of the factors that constrain SOC formation in these fractions is also limited, particularly within tropical climates. We used isotopically labelled residue (C-13) to determine the fate of residue C inputs into short-lived particulate organic matter (POM) and more persistent mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) across a broad climatic gradient (Delta MAT 10 degrees C) with varying soil properties. Climate was the primary driver of aboveground residue mass loss which corresponded to higher residue-derived POM formation. In contrast, MAOM formation efficiency was constrained by soil properties. The differential controls on POM and MAOM formation highlight that a targeted approach to grassland restoration is required; we must identify priority regions for improved grazing management in soils that have a relatively high silt+clay content and cation exchange capacity, with a low C saturation in the silt+clay fraction to deliver long-term SOC sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tomography-in-soil-science-from-the-first-experiments-to-modern-methods-a-review&quot;&gt;Tomography in Soil Science: From the First Experiments to Modern Methods (A Review)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract- The article provides an overview of the use of computed tomography in the study of soils from the first works to the present time. The development of computed tomography in the field of hardware and methods for processing tomographic data-from the first attempts to analyze soil structure using tomographic sections of low quality to modern methods of segmentation and analysis of volumetric structures using specialized software, correlation functions and neural networks-is discussed. The purpose of the article is to show the possibilities of methods for processing tomographic data in relation to studies of soil structure and to analyze possible trends of their further development. The article presents examples from the world experience of using computed tomography for a broad variety of soils, shows various methods of data segmentation that have been used from the first studies to the recent ones. The specific terminology coined in the course of the evolution of the method and various morphometric indicators for 2D and 3D images are presented, and a forecast of the prospects for the method in the near future is given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unexplored-role-of-preferential-flow-in-soil-carbon-dynamics&quot;&gt;The unexplored role of preferential flow in soil carbon dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water is a crucial factor controlling the fate and processing of soil organics. Water commonly flows through the vadose zone via preferential flow pathways, resulting in nonuniform and rapid infiltration. Hence, a large portion of the soil matrix is bypassed. Preferential flow paths, often associated with well-connected macropore networks (&amp;gt;300 pm 0), offer a unique balance between water availability, nutrient delivery, and re-oxygenation upon drainage. The heightened concentrations of moisture, nutrients, and oxygen make these locations optimal for high rates of microbial activity. Flow paths often display temporal stability. This stability results in repeated wetting and biogeochemical reactivation through time creating a lasting impact on micro-environmental conditions relevant to microbial functioning and carbon cycling in soil. Despite decades of research on preferential flow, there is still a need to link flow paths and the resultant heterogeneous moisture distributions to soil function. In this review, we discuss how preferential flow can serve as a framework of reference for the spatially and temporally heterogeneous biogeochemical cycling of soil carbon. We highlight the importance of combining current knowledge of pore-scale carbon dynamics with an appreciation of connected networks of hydraulically active pores/paths within the soil profile. Such combination opens new possibilities for upscaling pore-scale processes with the inclusion of resource heterogeneity at the macroscale. Working within this hydraulically connected framework can provide insight for the mechanistic representation of hot moments, which are temporally isolated large pulses of CO2 after rewetting or thawing events. We conclude with suggestions on knowledge gaps and stress the critical need of linking soil physics with biology to mechanistically understand soil functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-clean-energy-future-isnt-set-in-stone&quot;&gt;A clean energy future isn’t set in stone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social scientists and geoscientists must work together to critically evaluate and develop feasible visions for a sustainable future. Is a clean-energy economy more viable than a degrowth future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;numerical-soil-horizon-classification-from-south-africas-legacy-database&quot;&gt;Numerical soil horizon classification from South Africa’s legacy database&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allocation of soil profiles to one or another soil class depends on the surveyor’s experience and knowledge. Inconsistent class designations can affect the downstream uses of soil information such as hydrological and ecological applications. Therefore, numerical classifications can be useful in creating property-based soil clusters. Quantitative classification of soil horizons can also be beneficial for guiding physicochemical thresholds used in taxonomic criteria. This study aimed at taking a step in applying numerical classification techniques to the South African soil legacy database to quantitatively cluster horizons. For each master horizon, the database was clustered into new “diagnostic” horizons through Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) implemented in the Clustering Large Applications algorithm (CLARA). This algorithm has the benefit of using multiple subsets of the data making a more reliable initiation of medoids and it is a non-parametric approach making it more robust to outliers. To determine the optimal number of clusters, the silhouette width for 1 through 11 clusters was calculated. The number of clusters with the largest silhouette width was taken as the optimal number of clusters. The results of this study show that for O, E, and G (gleyed) horizons, the algorithm performs relatively well with the first two principle components capturing almost half of the variation in the data. However, for the A, B, and C horizons, the algorithm struggled to separate clusters sufficiently. The A horizon clusters only broadly corresponded to environmental factors (geography, climate, elevation, and geology) and the large clusters straddled numerous taxonomic thresholds. Moreover, the B horizon clusters correspond relatively well with environmental factors. Limitations identified, include bias in geographic location of modal soil profiles of the database, bias in the South African classification system, how to handle non-globular clusters, and outliers which add leverage to the clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spatial-variability-based-sample-size-allocation-for-stratified-sampling&quot;&gt;Spatial variability-based sample size allocation for stratified sampling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stratified sampling is one of the most commonly used sampling strategies for soil survey and mapping. An important issue in stratified sampling is the sample size allocation for each stratum. Neyman allocation is a typical sample size allocation approach in which the main idea is to assign more samples to a stratum with a larger internal standard deviation. By applying the spatial variability for sample size allocation, we proposed a new allocation approach (SVNA) for stratified spatial sampling. In this new approach, more samples were allocated to strata with both a bigger statistical standard deviation and larger spatial variability of the target variable. SVNA was evaluated using a simulated experiment based on real-world soil data of Jiangsu province, China. The target variable was soil organic matter (SOM), and land-use type was utilized for stratification. Simple random sampling (SRS) and spatial simulated annealing algorithm (SSA) were applied to determine sample locations. Results showed that the performance of SVNA generally was superior to Neyman allocation in terms of SOM content prediction at all sampling densities (4.28-0.19 points per km(2)) regardless of the application of SRS or SSA for sample location determination. The maximum reduction of mean squared error (MSE) for the SOM content prediction using SVNA was 11% using SRS and was 10% using SSA. Compared with Neyman allocation, SVNA obtained greater prediction accuracies in strata with large spatial variability and similar or slightly smaller prediction accuracies for strata with small spatial variability. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy of the SVNA approach tended to decrease when the sampling density was 0.37 points per km(2), and this sampling density threshold was not the same for each stratum. We concluded that SVNA is an efficient sample size allocation approach for stratified sampling in soil survey and mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-nutrients-increase-long-term-soil-carbon-gains-threefold-on-retired-farmland&quot;&gt;Soil nutrients increase long-term soil carbon gains threefold on retired farmland&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abandoned agricultural lands often accumulate soil carbon (C) following depletion of soil C by cultivation. The potential for this recovery to provide significant C storage benefits depends on the rate of soil C accumulation, which, in turn, may depend on nutrient supply rates. We tracked soil C for almost four decades following intensive agricultural soil disturbance along an experimentally imposed gradient in nitrogen (N) added annually in combination with other macro- and micro-nutrients. Soil %C accumulated over the course of the study in unfertilized control plots leading to a gain of 6.1 Mg C ha(-1) in the top 20 cm of soil. Nutrient addition increased soil %C accumulation leading to a gain of 17.8 Mg C ha(-1) in fertilized plots, nearly a threefold increase over the control plots. These results demonstrate that substantial increases in soil C in successional grasslands following agricultural abandonment occur over decadal timescales, and that C gain is increased by high supply rates of soil nutrients. In addition, soil %C continued to increase for decades under elevated nutrient supply, suggesting that short-term nutrient addition experiments underestimate the effects of soil nutrients on soil C accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;linking-decomposition-rates-of-soil-organic-amendments-to-their-chemical-composition&quot;&gt;Linking decomposition rates of soil organic amendments to their chemical composition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock of organic carbon contained within a soil represents the balance between inputs and losses. Inputs are defined by the ability of vegetation to capture and retain carbon dioxide, effects that management practices have on the proportion of captured carbon that is added to soil and the application organic amendments. The proportion of organic amendment carbon retained is defined by its rate of mineralisation. In this study, the rate of carbon mineralisation from 85 different potential soil organic amendments (composts, manures, plant residues and biosolids) was quantified under controlled environmental conditions over a 547 day incubation period. The composition of each organic amendment was quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance and mid- and near-infrared spectroscopies. Cumulative mineralisation of organic carbon from the amendments was fitted to a two-pool exponential model. Multivariate chemometric algorithms were derived to allow the size of the fast and slow cycling pools of carbon to be predicted from the acquired spectroscopic data. However, the fast and slow decomposition rate constants could not be predicted suggesting that prediction of the residence time of organic amendment carbon in soil would likely require additional information related to soil type, environmental conditions, and management practices in use at the site of application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;papatuanuku-earth-mother-indigenous-knowledge-in-21st-century-soil-management&quot;&gt;Papatuanuku, Earth Mother: indigenous knowledge in 21st century soil management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 20 March 2017 the New Zealand parliament passed the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Bill which established the Whanganui River as a legal ‘person’ with all of the rights, powers, duties, and liabilities of the same. The Act endorses and illustrates how Maori perceive their relationship to the natural world. The passing of the Act challenged the river people to restore their ancestral river to good health. Changes in land use beginning in the later part of the 19th century had seen soil fertility decline, water quality deteriorate and the soils that sustained life in its catchment increasingly washed out to sea. These impacts profoundly changed the lifestyles of the people that belonged to it. Describing the issues facing the river iwi (tribes) and their response to them will help illustrate traditional understandings relating to the river, the whenua (the land) and the life sustaining capacity of the soil. It also serves to demonstrate the relevance of traditional knowledge to addressing the current ecological crisis. This viewpoint focuses on key concepts from Maori understandings of the natural world that relate to the primary themes of this conference and suggest how they can contribute towards deepening and broadening our knowledge of soils and what needs to be done to sustain them. In particular the concept of ‘mauri’ will be explored and how that relates to the capacity of soils to support the life that belongs there. Maori, and many traditional peoples, regard the whole landscape as essentially interdependent and consider that the wellness of any part of it, be it soils, vegetation, water quality, etc., can only be understood within the context of the whole network of connections that sustain life. The challenge for researchers, from an indigenous perspective, is to be mindful of the ‘whole’ while focusing on the areas of their particular expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil, as a non-renewable resource, should be monitored continuously to prevent its degradation and promote sustainable agriculture. Soil spectroscopy in the visible-near infrared range is a fast and cost-effective analytical technique to predict soil properties. Although traditional machine learning methods are widely used for modeling soil spectral data, large spectral datasets may require better analytical methods for big data. Here, we explored the modeling potential of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for soil properties based on a large soil spectral library. The European topsoil dataset provided by the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) was used for DCNN modeling with the original absorbance spectra. Two single-task 16-layer DCNN models (LucasResNet-16 and LucasVGGNet-16) were used to make regression predictions of seven soil properties and classification predictions of soil texture. The effects of data pre-processing on single-task and multi-task DCNN modeling were assessed. The SHapley Additive exPlanations method was used to interpret the output of a DCNN model (LucasResNet-16). The DCNN models produced accurate predictions for most soil properties, and were superior to a single-task shallow convolutional neural network and traditional machine learning methods. Spectral transformation was effective for predicting some soil properties, while spectral downsampling led to a reduction in the modeling accuracy. The performance of a multi-task DCNN model built on the basis of LucasResNet-16 was improved compared with the performance of the single-task model. Soil organic carbon content, nitrogen content, cation exchange capacity, pH, and calcium carbonate content were well predicted, with the root mean squared error of 19.130 g.kg(-1), 0.971 g.kg(-1), 6.614 cmol(+).kg(-1), 0.326, and 24.526 g.kg(-1) , respectively. The overall classification accuracy of soil texture was 0.749 (four groups) and 0.566 (12 levels). The position of feature wavelengths differed among the soil properties, for which multiple characteristic peaks were common. This study fully demonstrates the modeling potential of deep learning with soil ultraspectral data, which could enhance precision agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-new-sensor-based-volume-measurement-methods-for-high-throughput-bulk-density-estimation-in-the-field-under-various-soil-conditions&quot;&gt;Assessing new sensor-based volume measurement methods for high-throughput bulk density estimation in the field under various soil conditions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil bulk density (BD) is a key soil property in soil science. BD is measured at the scale of the soil horizon with conventional methods: core sampling and rubber balloon. Regardless of the method, BD measurement in the field is cumbersome and time consuming, especially in stony soils, and new, less invasive methods have emerged, but their measurement quality needs to be compared with conventional methods. The photogrammetric technique (SfM) consists of the reconstruction of a given scene in 3D from multi-view photographs. The aim of the present work is to assess the SfM as a rapid, accurate method of measuring the volume of undisturbed soil for BD measurements, regardless of the soil depth and stone content. Ten soil horizons were investigated from various types of soils with different soil properties, especially texture (10 to 48% of clay) and stone content (0 to 73%). The bulk density of each horizon was measured with a reference method (core sampling), an excavation method (rubber balloon) and two recently developed sensor-based methods: SfM and a lightweight flash LiDar. For the sensor-based methods, an automated post-processing method was developed to reduce the human operating time. The BDs measured from the SfM were significantly similar to those measured from core sampling. At this stage, the lightweight flash LiDar is not sufficient to measure the BD with high accuracy. Finally, we recommend the use of SfM to measure BD regarding its robustness in varying soil conditions, especially stony soils, and we discuss the potential of the method regarding the recent advances in its field use with smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pedological-characteristics-of-artificialized-soils-a-snapshot&quot;&gt;Pedological characteristics of artificialized soils: A snapshot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onset of industrialization entailed the increase in soil artificialization worldwide. Soils from artificialized zones (SAZ) are the result of urban, industrial, traffic, mining or recreational land use. Knowledge of their characteristics is a prerequisite for evaluating the ability of SAZ to perform key functions and provide soil ecosystem services. Based on a selection of 102 papers published between 1991 and 2017, this article aims at providing a quantitative vision of the pedological characteristics of the different categories of SAZs as a function of the land use and soil type (natural profile, soil developed on allochthonous material). We show that, overall, the inherent characteristics of SAZ topsoil generally depend on the soil type - soil of allochthonous material being more stony and poorer in the &amp;lt; 2 mu m fraction - while manageable characteristics are a function of both the soil type and the land use, with the exception of pH that is mainly driven by the land use. However, a good characterization of SAZs requires a more systematic description, sampling and analysis to obtain comprehensive knowledge of their characteristics as several features are still too rarely measured such as cationic exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, soil depth, and nutrient concentrations. Sealed soils are still too rarely considered despite their large surface area. Such a characterization would allow a better management of the ecosystem services that SAZs fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-composition-of-sandstone-matrices-affects-rates-of-soil-formation&quot;&gt;How the composition of sandstone matrices affects rates of soil formation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils deliver multiple ecosystem services and their long-term sustainability is fundamentally controlled by the rates at which they form and erode. Our knowledge and understanding of soil formation is not commensurate with that of soil erosion, in part due to the difficulty of measuring the former. However, developments in cosmogenic radionuclide accumulation models have enabled soil scientists to more accurately constrain the rates at which soils form from bedrock. To date, all three major rock types - igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic lithologies - have been examined in such work. Soil formation rates have been measured and compared between these rock types, but the impact of rock characteristics on soil formation rates, such as rock matrices and mineralogy, have seldom been explored. In this UK-based study, we used cosmogenic radionuclide analysis to investigate whether the lithological variability of sandstone governs pedogenesis. Soil formation rates were measured on two arable hillslopes at Woburn and Hilton, which are underlain by different types of arenite sandstone. Rates were faster at Woburn, and we suggest that this is due to the fact that the Woburn sandstone formation is less cemented that that at Hilton. Similarly, rates at Woburn and Hilton were found to be faster than those measured at two other sandstone-based sites in the UK, and faster than those compiled in a global inventory of cosmogenic studies on sandstone-based soils. We suggest that the cementing agents present in matrix-abundant wackes studied previously may afford these sandstones greater structural integrity and resistance to weathering. This work points to the importance of factoring bedrock matrices into our understanding of soil formation rates, and the biogeochemical cycles these underpin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;field-test-of-two-background-temperature-correction-methods-of-dual-probe-heat-pulse-method&quot;&gt;Field test of two background temperature correction methods of dual probe heat pulse method&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual probe heat pulse (DPHP) method is a useful method to measure many soil physical properties in-situ, which play important roles in soil science, meteorology, hydrology and so on. It is essential to remove the effect of background temperature fluctuations for DPHP estimations. We compared two background temperature correction methods of DPHP method, linear trend method (LTM) and reference temperature method (RTM) in field experiments. We found that misused LTM lead to large errors in DPHP estimations with shallow burial depth. When the burial depth of temperature probe (d) of DPHP sensor is &amp;lt;14 mm, background temperature changes are related to environmental factors such as solar radiation and wind, and RTM can decrease the relative error (RE) in thermal conductivity (A) from 667% to 68%. Besides, our results also showed during the period from 9:00 to 16:00, the RTM method is valuable for getting accurate DPHP estimations with the 2 mm burial depth. After replacing LTM by RTM, REs were decreased to (6 +/- 28)% from (17 +/- 87) % in lambda, and were decreased to (9 +/- 17)% from (10 +/- 18)% in volumetric heat capacity (C-v). But RTM is also affected by other factors such as the spatially heterogeneous temperature distribution of tested sample and should be taken into account in the further studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agricultural-drought-prediction-based-on-conditional-distributions-of-vine-copulas&quot;&gt;Agricultural Drought Prediction Based on Conditional Distributions of Vine Copulas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring and prediction of agricultural drought are paramount to food security at the global and regional scales, particularly under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Soil moisture is an effective indicator for monitoring and characterizing agricultural drought. Soil moisture (agricultural drought) is mainly affected by precipitation (meteorological drought) and temperature (hot conditions). Owing to the flexibility of vine copulas in handling multidimensional variables by decomposing them into pair copula constructions (PCCs), we propose a novel drought prediction method using three predictors, namely antecedent meteorological drought, previous hot conditions, and persistent agricultural drought, based on the conditional distributions of C-vine copulas in a four-dimensional scenario. The proposed model was applied to agricultural drought (characterized by the standardized soil moisture index (SSI)) prediction with 1-2-months lead time for the summer season (i.e., August at a 6-months timescale) in China. Taking two severe agricultural drought events that occurred in many regions across China in August of 2006 and 2014 as validation cases, the SSI predictions with 1-2-months lead time using the conditional C-vine copulas model were found to be generally consistent with the corresponding historical SSI observations in most parts of China. Performance evaluation using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and F-1 score (F1S) for different climate regions also indicated that this model provided a reliable prediction of agricultural drought for most areas of China. The outcome of this study can serve as a guidance for drought prediction, early warning, and drought mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advancing-space-time-simulation-of-random-fields-from-storms-to-cyclones-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Advancing Space-Time Simulation of Random Fields: From Storms to Cyclones and Beyond&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistic stochastic simulation of hydro-environmental fluxes in space and time, such as rainfall, is challenging yet of paramount importance to inform environmental risk analysis and decision making under uncertainty. Here, we advance random fields simulation by introducing the concepts of general velocity fields and general anisotropy transformations. This expands the capabilities of the so-called Complete Stochastic Modeling Solution (CoSMoS) framework enabling the simulation of random fields (RF’s) preserving: (a) any non-Gaussian marginal distribution, (b) any spatiotemporal correlation structure (STCS), (c) general advection expressed by velocity fields with locally varying speed and direction, and (d) locally varying anisotropy. We also introduce new copula-based STCS’s and provide conditions guaranteeing their positive definiteness. To illustrate the potential of CoSMoS, we simulate RF’s with complex patterns and motion mimicking rainfall storms moving across an area, spiraling fields resembling weather cyclones, fields converging to (or diverging from) a point, and colliding air masses. The proposed methodology is implemented in the freely available CoSMoS R package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-potential-surface-ponding-in-agriculture-using-uav-sfm&quot;&gt;Mapping potential surface ponding in agriculture using UAV-SfM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the environmental problems that could affect agriculture, one of the most critical is ponding. This may be defined as water storage on the surface in concavities and depressions due to soil saturation. Stagnant water can seriously affect crops and the management of agricultural landscapes. It is mainly caused by prolonged rainfall events, soil type, or wrong mechanization practices, which cause soil compaction. To better understand this problem and thus provide adequate solutions to reduce the related risk, high-resolution topographic information could be strategically important because it offers an accurate representation of the surface morphology. In the last decades, new remote sensing techniques provide interesting opportunities to understand the processes on the Earth’s surface based on geomorphic signatures. Among these, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), combined with the structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry technique, represent a solid, low-cost, rapid, and flexible solution for geomorphological analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study aims to present a new approach to detect the potential areas exposed to water stagnation at the farm scale. The high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) from UAV-SfM data is used to do this. The potential water depth was calculated in the DEM using the relative elevation attribute algorithm. The detection of more pronounced concavities and convexities allowed an estimation and mapping of the potential ponding conditions. The results were assessed by observations and field measurements and are promising, showing a Cohen’s k(X) accuracy of 0.683 for the planimetric extent of the ponding phenomena and a Pearson’s r(xy) coefficient of 0.971 for the estimation of pond water depth. The proposed workflow provides a useful indication to stakeholders for better agricultural management in lowland landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development-of-a-soil-fertility-index-using-on-line-vis-nir-spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Development of a soil fertility index using on-line Vis-NIR spectroscopy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil fertility index (SFI) is commonly used for soil fertility assessment, which is critical for managing in-field variabilities and maximizing crop production with minimum environmental impacts. However, the majority of earlier SFIs were laboratory-based soil analyses. This study developed a novel SFI using on-line collected visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectra. Six agricultural fields were scanned using an on-line vis-NIR sensor (CompactSpec, Tec5 Technology, Germany), when 139 soil samples were collected and analyzed for soil pH, organic carbon, available- phosphorous (P), potassium, magnesium (Mg), calcium, sodium, moisture content (MC) and cation exchange capacity. A minimum dataset was developed comprising the fertility attributes that showed pairwise correlation (r) smaller than 0.75. This was followed by a principal component analysis to calculate the weight factor of each parameter to be used in the SFI formulation using a double-weighted additive function. The data matrix consisting of the SFI and soil spectra was divided into calibration (70 %) and prediction (30 datasets. The former set was subjected to a partial least squares regression to calibrate SFI model, whose accuracy was validated using the prediction set. Results showed that the derived SFI was moderately to highly correlated with P (r = 0.57), pH (r = 0.75), and Mg (r = 0.74) and weakly correlated with MC (r = 0.26). The online vis-NIR sensor predicted SFI with very good accuracy [coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.75 and ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) = 2.01]. Therefore, it is concluded that the vis-NIR can accurately predict SFI directly from on-line scanned soil spectra, which can effectively assess soil fertility and manage in-field variability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internet-of-things-iot-for-double-ring-infiltrometer-automation&quot;&gt;Internet of Things (IoT) for double ring infiltrometer automation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double ring infiltrometer is a simple device used to measure water infiltration rate in the soil, one of the most important hydro physical characteristics and an essential parameter for various applications including: surface irrigation and drainage projects, infiltration or water purification basins, seepage losses at canals, soil leaching at waste storage sites. However, the high spatial variability of a soil makes a single point measurement rarely representative of an entire field. Nonetheless, Double Ring Infiltration tests are tedious, time consuming and require continuous attention, hence limiting the number of tests that may be performed simultaneously on a given site. In the present research, an automated Internet of Things (IoT) double ring infiltrometer (DRI) is developed and validated in a loamy field. It consists of a DRI equipped with an ESP-32 microcontroller chip, a GPS module, a solenoid valve, a DIY conductance water level sensor, and a SD card module powered by a 12 V 11000mAh Li-ion battery charged by a 10 W solar panel. The double ring infiltrometer is designed to calculate the infiltration rate in real time, to store the data with the time stamp and geographical coordinates on an SD card or, to use a cloud service platform to upload the data over the internet. The aim is to facilitate soil infiltration mapping for precision agriculture and to build a soil infiltration inventory that could be used to continuously improve existing soil database. The system was assembled and tested at nine different locations on a loamy soil experimental field. For validation, conventional (manually operated) tests were conducted at the same time. The system proved to be reliable (R2 = 0.99), cost effective (115$) and a hassle-free solution, ideal for multiple soil infiltration measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-dual-probe-heat-pulse-based-sensor-that-simultaneously-determines-soil-thermal-properties-soil-water-content-and-soil-water-matric-potential&quot;&gt;A dual-probe heat pulse-based sensor that simultaneously determines soil thermal properties, soil water content and soil water matric potential&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dual-probe heat pulse (DPHP) sensor is a robust tool that can measure soil thermal properties and associated soil physical properties and processes. A new DPHP based sensor was developed to simultaneously measure soil thermal properties, soil water content and soil water matric potential. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the sensor performance. The new sensor was able to measure each soil property with acceptable accuracy. The accuracy of the matric potential determinations was approximately 10% in log scale. The effective range for w measurements was -1000 to -2.5 m of water, and the accuracy of the w determinations was best between -350 and -2.5 m of water, which included values of field capacity and wilting point for most soils and crops. The sensor design included a single heater wire to provide simultaneous heat inputs to two different materials, i.e., the soil and the sensor porous medium. The single heater wire did not influence sensor accuracy as long as the soil and the sensor porous medium thermal conductivity values were not significantly different. The new DPHP based sensor effectively measured various soil properties, including soil water matric potential, soil water content, and soil thermal property values.&lt;/p&gt;
