&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-scalable-method-for-the-estimation-of-spatial-disaggregation-models&quot;&gt;A scalable method for the estimation of spatial disaggregation models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaining information about detailed processes using aggregation information is a frequent challenge in research involving geospatial data, with examples in different fields of knowledge such as agronomy, soil science, meteorology, public health, epidemiology, and others. Analyses using aggregated data lead to distorted conclusions since they disregard local patterns, and such a problem has motivated different approaches for reconstructing the information in a finer resolution from the aggregated data. However, most existing methods focus on the particular case where the volume of data does not exceed the amount of memory available for computations, a situation that has become increasingly less frequent with the fast pace of data generation nowadays. In practice, this problem limits either spatial resolution or coverage of applications, thus precluding their use in a more general context. In this paper, we address the problem of disaggregation of spatial data with huge datasets by proposing a scalable method to estimate the parameters of a well-established model. We propose an iterative scheme for model estimation and prove its convergence to a critical point of the likelihood function derived. To test the method, we provide a controlled simulation and a real example for sugarcane production in Brazil. In the simulation, the results indicate a successful reconstruction of 1 million pixels from 90 block areas. In the real example, the results had a compatible match with the agronomic literature, indicating a reasonable prediction of sugarcane production in a 100 m spatial resolution (i.e., approx. 5 x 10(8) pixels) from 5,565 block-areas. Compared to the most similar previous work, scalability allowed us to use a nearly 100 times higher resolution, which corresponds to 10,000 times more pixels. With our methods, we expect to assist researchers from different fields in disaggregating spatial information to larger areas or higher resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of physical archives of soil material from field sampling activities has been widely recognized. If we want to use archive material for new destructive analyses to support a task, such as spatial mapping, then an efficient sub-sampling strategy is needed, both to manage analytical costs and to conserve the archive material. In this paper we present an approach to this problem when the objective is spatial mapping by ordinary kriging. Our objective was to subsample the physical archive from the Ethiopia Soil Information System (EthioSIS) survey of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) for spatial mapping of two variables, concentrations of particular fractions of selenium and iodine in the soil, which had not been measured there. We used data from cognate parts of surrounding regions of Ethiopia to estimate variograms of these properties, and then computed prediction error variances for maps in SNNPR based on proposed subsets of the archive of different size, selected to optimize a spatial coverage criterion (with some close sample pairs included). On this basis a subsample was selected. This is a preregistered experiment in that we have proposed criteria for evaluating the success of our approach, and are publishing that in advance of receiving analytical data on the subsampled material from the laboratories where they are being processed. A subsequent short report will publish the outcome. The use of preregistered trials is widely recommended and used in areas of science including public health, and we believe that it is a sound strategy to promote reproducible research in soil science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;figures-landscapes-and-landsystems-digital-locations-connectivity-and-communications-comment&quot;&gt;Figures, landscapes and landsystems: Digital locations, connectivity and communications COMMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current geomorphological research tends to give preference to landforms rather than landscapes. This commentary brings these notions closer together and incorporates varied views of ‘landscape’ (such as landscapes in art and poetry) as well as showing the difficulties of communicating them to audiences wider than geomorphology. The paper promotes the use of decimal Latitude Longitude (dLL) values to assist better location of samples, analyses and especially landforms, to produce ‘information surfaces’ within landscape and landsystem approaches to geomorphology. This will also help the development of geomorphic visual literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calibration-set-optimization-and-library-transfer-for-soil-carbon-estimation-using-soil-spectroscopy-a-review&quot;&gt;Calibration set optimization and library transfer for soil carbon estimation using soil spectroscopy-A review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource-efficient techniques for accurate soil property estimation are necessary to satisfy the increasing demand for soil data to support environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and spatial modeling. Over the last 30 yr, infrared soil spectroscopy has developed into a rapid, robust, and cost-effective technique for soil carbon analysis. Ongoing global efforts to make soil spectroscopy operational require the development of soil spectral libraries, which are the main source of data for the construction of calibration models. Understanding calibration optimization is important to ensure the efficient use of soil spectral libraries for the accurate estimation of soil carbon. Moreover, spectral library transfer can benefit new data collection, soil monitoring, and modeling efforts. This review presents techniques for optimization of calibration models and library transfer. Selection of calibration set size and subsetting are presented as current calibration optimization techniques. Moreover, spiking is discussed as an effective technique for spectral library transfer. Overall, studies have suggested that an increase in calibration size improves model performance and this continues until an optimal size is reached. Additionally, subsetting can improve model performance if the resulting subsets reduce the variability of spectrally active components. Studies have also suggested that spiking is effective when used in conjunction with subsetting techniques. These findings denote the current applicability and potential of optimization and library transfer techniques for the accurate estimation of soil carbon with soil spectroscopy. Future efforts should focus on refining optimization techniques to further expand the operability of soil spectroscopy for soil carbon estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;realistic-rates-of-nitrogen-addition-increase-carbon-flux-rates-but-do-not-change-soil-carbon-stocks-in-a-temperate-grassland&quot;&gt;Realistic rates of nitrogen addition increase carbon flux rates but do not change soil carbon stocks in a temperate grassland&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the biosphere carbon (C) sink are of utmost importance given rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Concurrent global changes, such as increasing nitrogen (N) deposition, are affecting how much C can be stored in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the extent of these impacts will help in predicting the fate of the biosphere C sink. However, most N addition experiments add N in rates that greatly exceed ambient rates of N deposition, making inference from current knowledge difficult. Here, we leveraged data from a 13-year N addition gradient experiment with addition rates spanning realistic rates of N deposition (0, 1, 5, and 10 g N m−2 year−1) to assess the rates of N addition at which C uptake and storage were stimulated in a temperate grassland. Very low rates of N addition stimulated gross primary productivity and plant biomass, but also stimulated ecosystem respiration such that there was no net change in C uptake or storage. Furthermore, we found consistent, nonlinear relationships between N addition rate and plant responses such that intermediate rates of N addition induced the greatest ecosystem responses. Soil pH and microbial biomass and respiration all declined with increasing N addition indicating that negative consequences of N addition have direct effects on belowground processes, which could then affect whole ecosystem C uptake and storage. Our work demonstrates that experiments that add large amounts of N may be underestimating the effect of low to intermediate rates of N deposition on grassland C cycling. Furthermore, we show that plant biomass does not reliably indicate rates of C uptake or soil C storage, and that measuring rates of C loss (i.e., ecosystem and soil respiration) in conjunction with rates of C uptake and C pools are crucial for accurately understanding grassland C storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-fungi-solve-the-carbon-dilemma&quot;&gt;Will fungi solve the carbon dilemma?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils are hotspots of diversity and sustain many globally important functions. Here we focus on the most burning issue: how to keep soils as carbon sinks while maintaining their productivity. Evidence shows that life in soils plays a crucial role in improving soil health yet soil ecological processes are often ignored in soil sciences. In this review, we highlight the potential of fungi to increase soil carbon sequestration while maintaining crop yield, functions needed to sustain human population on Earth and at same time keep the Earth livable. We propose management strategies that steer towards more fungal activity but also high functional diversity of fungi which will lead to more stable carbon sources in soil but also affects the structure of the soil food web up to ecosystem level. We list knowledge gaps that limit our ability to steer soil fungal communities such that stabilising carbon in top soils becomes more effective. Using the natural capacity of a biodiverse soil community to sequester carbon delivers double benefit: reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide by storing photosynthesized carbon in soil and increasing agricultural yields by restoring organic matter content of degraded soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-textural-fractions-of-the-usda-using-those-of-the-international-system-a-quantile-approach&quot;&gt;Estimating textural fractions of the USDA using those of the International System: A quantile approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In soil science, the two most frequently used classification systems for the soil particle size distribution are the schemes by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the so-called International System (IS), whose difference is the upper particle size limit of the silt fraction, namely, 0.02 mm for the IS and 0.05 mm for the USDA system. The existence of these and other systems creates a disparity that hinders and prevents the use and exchange of soil information worldwide. To solve this problem, it is necessary to devise methodologies for the conversion of textural fractions between the different classification systems. This work focuses on the estimation of the USDA silt fraction from the basic textural fractions (sand, silt and clay) in the IS. Five models are currently available for that purpose: the log-linear interpolation method, the Minasny-McBratney-Bristow regression formula, the Shirazi-Boersma-Johnson interpolation method, the Minasny-McBratney regression formula, and the Padarian-Minasny-McBratney regression formula. The accuracy of some of these methods has already been assessed, but in this work we develop a new methodology, based on a local quantile regression, which improves and enriches this evaluation, providing both the regions of the textural triangle where the predictions of the models are acceptable, and the regions where each model is most appropriate. The data used were taken from the publicly available National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database, from which more than 270,000 soil horizon samples were selected for having valid texture data. The analysis carried out concludes that the Padarian-Minasny-McBratney regression formula is the best model of those evaluated. In addition, the tool developed for the evaluation of the models becomes a new model that provides point estimates of the USDA silt fraction from the basic textural fractions in the IS, with further improvement, compared to the 5 models evaluated, as it also provides a prediction interval for those estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-water-potential-a-historical-perspective-and-recent-breakthroughs&quot;&gt;Soil water potential: A historical perspective and recent breakthroughs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil water potential is a cornerstone in defining the thermodynamic state of soil water required to quantify phenomena such as water phase change, water movement, heat transfer, electric current, chemical transport, and mechanical stress and deformation in the earth’s shallow subsurface environment. This potential has historically been conceptualized as free energy stored in a until volume of soil water. Though the concept of soil water potential has been evolving over the past 120 yr, a consensual definition is still lacking, and answers to some fundamental questions remain controversial and elusive. What are the origins and mechanisms for the free energy of soil water? Can the common mathematical expression of soil water potential as superposition of gravitational, osmotic, and matric potentials be used to define water phase transitions in soil? Are these major components of soil water potential independent or coupled? Is pore water pressure always tensile under unsaturated conditions? If so, how can soil water density be as high as 1.7 g cm(-3)? How do adsorptive soil-water interactions originating from the electromagnetic field around and within soil particles transfer to mechanical pore pressure? In this review, the authors (a) provide critical analysis of historical definitions of soil water potential to identify their strengths, limitations, and flaws; (b) synthesize the origins of electromagnetic energies in soil to clarify the fundamental differences between adsorptive and capillary soil water potential mechanisms; (c) introduce a recently emerging concept of soil matric potential that unifies contributions of adsorption and capillarity to soil water potential; and (d) illustrate the generality and promise of the unified definition of soil water potential for answering some of the fundamental questions that remain elusive to the hydrology, geoengineering, and geoscience communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;machine-learning-in-vadose-zone-hydrology-a-flashback&quot;&gt;Machine learning in vadose zone hydrology: A flashback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been recently applied extensively in various disciplines of vadose zone hydrology. However, not much attention has been paid to their database-dependent accuracy and uncertainty, reproducibility, and delivery, which undermines their applications to real-world problems. We discuss lessons from the past and emphasize the need for and lack of fundamental protocols (i.e., detailed clarification on data processing, ML models accessibility, and a clear path for reproducing results).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;same-soil-different-climate-crop-model-intercomparison-on-translocated-lysimeters&quot;&gt;Same soil, different climate: Crop model intercomparison on translocated lysimeters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crop model intercomparison studies have mostly focused on the assessment of predictive capabilities for crop development using weather and basic soil data from the same location. Still challenging is the model performance when considering complex interrelations between soil and crop dynamics under a changing climate. The objective of this study was to test the agronomic crop and environmental flux-related performance of a set of crop models. The aim was to predict weighing lysimeter-based crop (i.e., agronomic) and water-related flux or state data (i.e., environmental) obtained for the same soil monoliths that were taken from their original environment and translocated to regions with different climatic conditions, after model calibration at the original site. Eleven models were deployed in the study. The lysimeter data (2014-2018) were from the Dedelow (Dd), Bad Lauchstadt (BL), and Selhausen (Se) sites of the TERENO (TERrestrial ENvironmental Observatories) SOILCan network. Soil monoliths from Dd were transferred to the drier and warmer BL site and the wetter and warmer Se site, which allowed a comparison of similar soil and crop under varying climatic conditions. The model parameters were calibrated using an identical set of crop- and soil-related data from Dd. Environmental fluxes and crop growth of Dd soil were predicted for conditions at BL and Se sites using the calibrated models. The comparison of predicted and measured data of Dd lysimeters at BL and Se revealed differences among models. At site BL, the crop models predicted agronomic and environmental components similarly well. Model performance values indicate that the environmental components at site Se were better predicted than agronomic ones. The multi-model mean was for most observations the better predictor compared with those of individual models. For Se site conditions, crop models failed to predict site-specific crop development indicating that climatic conditions (i.e., heat stress) were outside the range of variation in the data sets considered for model calibration. For improving predictive ability of crop models (i.e., productivity and fluxes), more attention should be paid to soil-related data (i.e., water fluxes and system states) when simulating soil-crop-climate interrelations in changing climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparison-of-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-algorithms-for-surface-soil-moisture-mapping-using-optical-thermal-microwave-remote-sensing-synergies&quot;&gt;Comparison of bagging, boosting and stacking algorithms for surface soil moisture mapping using optical-thermal-microwave remote sensing synergies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil moisture information is key to irrigation water management, drought monitoring, and yield prediction. It plays a vital role in the water cycle and energy budget between the earth’s surface and atmosphere. Hence, its monitoring is crucial for both natural and anthropogenic environments. While the current remote sensing-based global SM products available at coarser resolution (3/15 km) are unsuitable for field-level operations, the most widely used microwave remote sensing suffers from model complexities and in-situ data requirements. Weather conditions limit the alternate approaches such as optical/thermal. This study aims to map surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m spatial resolution in a semi-arid region by fusing optical, thermal, and microwave remote sensing data using bagging, boosting, and stacking machine learning approaches. The reference data were collected using a soil moisture meter. The covariates included radar backscatter from Sentinel-1, visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, land surface temperature, and spectral indices derived from Landsat 8. Boruta algorithm was used for feature selection which identified radar backscatter, modified normalized difference water index, and land surface temperature as the most critical covariates impacting the SSM. The random forest (RF) showed the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.71), and least root mean square error (RMSE = 5.17%). The cubist model had the least mean bias error (MBE = 0.21%) during independent validation. Stacking of cubist, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and RF using elastic net (ELNET) as meta-learner further reduced the MBE (0.18%) and RMSE (5.03%) during the validation. Overall, stacking multiple machine learning models improved model prediction and can be recommended to improve the digital soil moisture mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-and-trade-offs-of-agricultural-diversity-for-food-security-in-low-and-middle-income-countries-a-review-of-existing-knowledge-and-evidence&quot;&gt;The benefits and trade-offs of agricultural diversity for food security in low-and middle-income countries: A review of existing knowledge and evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity in agricultural systems is often presented as having benefits for multiple purposes like food and nutrition security in low- and middle-income countries. Our review aims to give an overview of the strength and direction of the diversity-food security relationship as presented in research published since 2010, based on a comprehensive search in Web of Science. We present an overview and synthesize results for different spatial scales and units of observation, from individual to global and for the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, stability and utilisation. Eighty-eight of the 924 surveyed publications meet the inclusion criteria and report the direction and magnitude of 314 individual diversity-food security relationships. In almost two thirds of all cases, agricultural diversity had a positive effect on food security. In about one third of the relationships there was no effect of agricultural diversity on food security, or the results were mixed. These numbers hold for the availability, access and utilisation dimensions of food security and at individual, household and farm scales, but the number of studies was too small to draw robust conclusions on the stability dimension and at global scale. Diversity can be an important driver of food security, but the magnitude of the contribution depends on the broader socio-economic and biophysical characteristics of the local farming system. We conclude that diversification can be a potential strategy to improve food and nutrition security. Yet, it is not a necessary characteristic of all agricultural systems at all costs especially in the presence of other strategies that can potentially achieve similar outcomes. We make several recommendations to strengthen future studies that can help identify how strongly related agricultural diversity and food security are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rigorous-empirical-and-quantitative-a-proposed-pipeline-for-soil-health-assessments&quot;&gt;Rigorous, empirical, and quantitative: a proposed pipeline for soil health assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil health is a promising lens through which to approach land management, having the potential to serve as a descriptor of biophysical processes and as an effective communication tool across stakeholders. However, this potential has been largely unrealized due to difficulty in quantitatively assessing soil health and linking those assessments to outcomes. Here we discuss many multiple persistent obstacles to quantitative soil health assessment and outline a suite of analyses to help address those obstacles. Specifically, we propose a quantitative approach to developing and selecting soil health indicators that help connect management-induced changes in soil health to specific outcomes (e.g., yield or water quality). To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we perform a small case study using published data from North Carolina and New York cropping systems. Additionally, we outline how this approach is scalable and flexible enough to integrate future soil health metric development. The proposed approach stands to provide a quantitative, empirical basis for future measurement, assessment, and interpretation of soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diffuse-reflectance-spectroscopy-characterises-the-functional-chemistry-of-soil-organic-carbon-in-agricultural-soils&quot;&gt;Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy characterises the functional chemistry of soil organic carbon in agricultural soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil organic carbon (SOC) originates from a complex mixture of organic materials, and to better understand its role in soil functions, one must characterise its chemical composition. However, current methods, such as solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, are time-consuming and expensive. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the visible, near infrared and mid-infrared regions (vis-NIR: 350-2500 nm; mid-IR: 4000-400 cm(-1)) can also be used to characterise SOC chemistry; however, it is difficult to know the frequencies where the information occurs. Thus, we correlated the C functional groups from the C-13 NMR to the frequencies in the vis-NIR and mid-IR spectra using two methods: (1) 2-dimensional correlations of C-13 NMR spectra and the diffuse reflectance spectra, and (2) modelling the NMR functional C groups with the reflectance spectra using support vector machines (SVM) (validated using 5 times repeated 10-fold cross-validation). For the study, we used 99 mineral soils from the agricultural regions of Sweden. The results show clear correlations between organic functional C groups measured with NMR and specific frequencies in the vis-NIR and mid-IR spectra. While the 2D correlations showed general relationships (mainly related to the total SOC content), analysing the importance of the wavelengths in the SVM models revealed more detail. Generally, models using mid-IR spectra produced slightly better estimates than the vis-NIR. The best estimates were for the alkyl C group (R-2 = 0.83 and 0.85, vis-NIR and mid-IR, respectively), and the O/N-alkyl C group was the most difficult to estimate (R-2 = 0.34 and 0.38, vis-NIR and mid-IR, respectively). Combining C-13 NMR with the cost-effective diffuse reflectance methods could potentially increase the number of measured samples and improve the spatial and temporal characterisation of SOC. However, more studies with a wider range of soil types and land management systems are needed to further evaluate the conditions under which these methods could be used. Highlights Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to characterise and model SOC functional chemistry. NMR derived C functional groups could be modelled with vis-NIR and mid-IR diffuse reflectance spectra. The methods allow for characterisation of SOC chemical composition on whole mineral soil samples. The approach can improve the spatial and temporal characterisation of SOC composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discrete-element-modeling-of-aggregate-shape-and-internal-structure-effects-on-weibull-distribution-of-tensile-strength&quot;&gt;Discrete element modeling of aggregate shape and internal structure effects on Weibull distribution of tensile strength&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many soil processes and functions, including carbon storage, water and element cycling, and crop productivity, are directly or indirectly affected by soil aggregates. As a key property, aggregate tensile strength is usually quantified by the Weibull distribution. This distribution was found to depend on soil texture, organic matter content, and aggregate shape; however, effects of cementing agents (i.e., clay mineral and organic compounds) on aggregate tensile strength cannot be empirically studied independent of shape. The objective was to apply Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) to simulate the rupture of soil aggregates of different shapes but the same assumed distributions of cementing agents. The hypothesis was that the Weibull modulus of aggregate tensile strength could be used to describe the heterogeneity of the particle binding forces within the aggregate. Multiple DEM simulations of aggregate rupture were carried out for sets of randomly generated binding force distributions between particles of the same diameter. Aggregate properties and shapes were obtained from those observed in arable Gleyic Cambisol topsoil from plots with and without vegetation of a soil compaction trial; additional aggregate shapes were simulated to increase the predictive range. The simulation results showed that (i) the sensitivity of Weibull modulus of aggregate tensile strength to the heterogeneity of particle binding force distribution increased with aggregate sphericity, (ii) the value of the Weibull modulus decreased with increasing heterogeneity of this distribution, and (iii) internal heterogeneity also reduced the crack surface area produced by aggregate rupture. Results corresponded to friability theory implying that small values of Weibull modulus indicated more complex soil structural organization. The DEM simulations could help explaining complex interactions between aggregate shape cementing agents and stability. Our DEM approach also uncovered the importance of Weibull modulus to assess structural features of soil aggregates and to describe the heterogeneity of the particle binding forces within the aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capacity-and-intensity-indicators-to-evaluate-the-effect-of-different-crop-sequences-and-cover-crops-on-soil-physical-quality-of-two-different-textured-soils-from-pampas-region&quot;&gt;Capacity and Intensity Indicators to evaluate the effect of different crop sequences and cover crops on soil physical quality of two different textured soils from Pampas Region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil physical degradation is a current problem in Molisols of the Pampas Region under no-tillage (NT), that has been related to over-simplified agricultural systems with scarce or no rotations and long winter bare fallows. Soil physical quality (SPQ) is a key factor of soil health and productivity, as it controls root development and air and water fluxes and storage in the soil, which in turn affect nutrient uptake and plant growth. Cover crops have been proposed as a companion agricultural practice to improve NT performance and SPQ. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of winter cover crops in different cropping sequences on capacity and intensity indicators of SPQ in two soils of different texture under NT and to compare it with different traditional crop sequences, including non-agricultural plots. SPQ was evaluated at two different sites, one with a silty loam Argiudoll and the other with a sandy loam Hapludoll. Treatments included plots with and without cover crops, with different summer crop sequences (continuous soybean and corn - soybean rotations). Also, a corn - wheat/soybean rotation with and without pastures was evaluated. All treatments had more than 15 years under the same management. We measured soil organic carbon (SOC), and capacity SPQ indicators (bulk density, total porosity, pore size distribution, air capacity, plant available water, relative field capacity and S index). We also measured dynamic SPQ indicators derived from field infiltration tests (saturated and near saturation hydraulic conductivity, effective macro and mesoporosity, and porosity connectivity indexes for different pore families). On the silty loam Argiudoll, cover crops increased SOC but failed to improve SPQ. This was related to soil physical degradation and the low ability of these soils for structure regeneration. On the sandy loam Hapludoll, cover crops had mixed effects on SOC and pore size distribution, but increased near saturation hydraulic conductivity, in the case of the corn - soybean rotation with cover crops, reaching values similar to those of a natural grassland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fusion-of-visible-to-near-infrared-and-mid-infrared-spectroscopy-to-estimate-soil-organic-carbon&quot;&gt;Fusion of visible-to-near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy to estimate soil organic carbon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectral techniques such as visible-to-near-infrared (VIS-NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopies have been regarded as effective alternatives to laboratory-based methods for determining soil organic carbon (SOC). Research to explore the potential of the fusion of VIS-NIR and MIR absorbance for improving SOC prediction is needed, since each individual spectral range may not contain sufficient information to yield reasonable estimation accuracy. Here, we investigated two data fusion strategies that differed in input data, including direct concatenation of full-spectral absorbance and concatenation of selected predictors by optimal band combination (OBC) algorithm. Specifically, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was adopted to optimize the spectral data before and after data fusion. Prediction models for SOC were developed using partial least squares regression. Results demonstrated that estimations for SOC using MIR absorbance (i.e., validation R-2 = 0.45-0.64) generally outperformed those using VIS-NIR (i.e., validation R-2 = 0.20-0.44). Compared to the raw absorbance counterparts, CWT decomposing could improve the prediction accuracy for SOC, for both the individual absorbance and the fusion of VIS-NIR and MIR absorbance. Among all the models investigated, the combinational use of VIS-NIR and MIR using OBC fusion at CWT scale of 1 yielded the optimal prediction, providing the highest validation R-2 of 0.66. This model with 10 selected spectral parameters as input is of small total data volume, large processing speed and efficiency, confirming the potential of OBC in fusing both types of spectral data. In summary, CWT decomposing and OBC strategy are powerful algorithms in analyzing the spectral data, and allow the VIS-NIR and MIR spectral fusion models to improve the SOC estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tillage loosens soil, reduces bulk density, alters soil structure and pore size distribution, consequently affecting the shape of the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) and related hydraulic properties and parameters in the top layer of soil. Knowledge of SWRC and hydraulic properties are needed for many soil, agronomic, irrigation, hydrological and environmental studies. This work compares the effect of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) practices on SWRCs and their estimated parameters at 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depths based on soil samples collected in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Undisturbed soil cores were extracted using stainless steel cylinders (8 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height) from 0 to 15 cm and 15-30 cm depths in planted corn rows. Soil core sampling was replicated five times in a randomized block design. Soil cores were saturated prior to measurement by the capillarity method and SWRC were measured using the HYPROP evaporative method. Measured soil-water retention curve data were fitted for no-tilled and tilled soils using the van Genuchten (vG) equation for each depth. Results indicated that differences existed in SWRC properties and estimated parameters of vG equation between the two tillage management practices. Averaged across 4 years and two depths, the SWRC parameters alpha, n, and theta(s) were significantly greater under CT than under NT, however, theta(r) was not affected by tillage. The higher alpha, n, and theta(s) values in CT were likely associated with greater soil loosening and disturbance induced by CT operations, thereby forming greater macroporosity and pore volume that, in turn, caused a decrease in bulk density in CT compared to NT. Regardless of the tillage method, SWRCs enable growers and researchers to select farming and irrigation management practices that improve water use efficiency, sustain crop productivity and maintain environmental quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-pedology-and-soil-classification-contribute-towards-sustainable-development-as-a-data-source-and-information-carrier&quot;&gt;How can pedology and soil classification contribute towards sustainable development as a data source and information carrier?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil classification is based on both the properties of the soil material and the pedogenetic pathways responsible for those properties. Because soil properties are linked to soil function and potential, information on soil classification has formed the basis for empirical interpretations of mapping units in terms of limitations or suit abilities for a wide range of land uses. In this way, a soil type acts as an accessible “carrier of information” presenting “the story of..”. Though valuable for broad land-use assessments, these empirical interpretations of soil functionality are inadequate to answer modern interdisciplinary questions focused on sustainable development. Four case studies are presented showing various quantitative approaches focusing on soil functions contributing to ecosystem services in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the European Green Deal, demonstrating that: (i) the use of soil surveys and associated databases feeding soil-water-atmosphere-plant simulation models can contribute to defining soil functions and ecosystem services; (ii) hydropedological characterization of soil types can allow a strong reduction in the number of landscape units to be considered, improving practical applicability; (iii) pedotransfer functions can successfully link soil data to modeling parameters; (iv) functionality requires expression of soil management effects on properties of a given soil type, to be expressed by phenoforms; (v) only models can be applied to explore important future effects of climate change by running IPCC scenarios; and (vi) the most effective level of soil classification-acting as carriers of information when defining soil functionality-will differ depending on the spatial scale being considered, whether local, regional or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-prediction-methods-for-interpreting-complex-models-of-soil-variation&quot;&gt;Beyond prediction: methods for interpreting complex models of soil variation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the spatial variation of soil properties is central to many sub-disciplines of soil science. Commonly in soil mapping studies, a soil map is constructed through prediction by a statistical or non-statistical model calibrated with measured values of the soil property and environmental covariates of which maps are available. In recent years, the field has gradually shifted attention towards more complex statistical and algorithmic tools from the field of machine learning. These models are particularly useful for their predictive capabilities and are often more accurate than classical models, but they lack interpretability and their functioning cannot be readily visualized. There is a need to understand how these models can be used for purposes other than making accurate prediction and whether it is possible to extract information on the relationships among variables found by the models. In this paper we describe and evaluate a set of methods for the interpretation of complex models of soil variation. An overview is presented of how model-independent methods can serve the purpose of interpreting and visualizing different aspects of the model. We illustrate the methods with the interpretation of two mapping models in a case study mapping topsoil organic carbon in France. We reveal the importance of each driver of soil variation, their interaction, as well as the functional form of the association between environmental covariate and the soil property. Interpretation is also conducted locally for an area and two spatial locations with distinct land use and climate. We show that in all cases important insights can be obtained, both into the overall model functioning and into the decision made by the model for a prediction at a location. This underpins the importance of going beyond accurate prediction in soil mapping studies. Interpretation of mapping models reveal how the predictions are made and can help us formulating hypotheses on the underlying soil processes and mechanisms driving soil variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;high-resolution-field-measurement-of-soil-heat-capacity-and-changes-in-soil-moisture-using-a-dual-probe-heat-pulse-distributed-temperature-sensing-approach&quot;&gt;High-Resolution Field Measurement of Soil Heat Capacity and Changes in Soil Moisture Using a Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse Distributed Temperature Sensing Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing interest in studying the variability of soil water content and its spatial scale dependency necessitates the development of new techniques to accurately monitor soil water over a wide range of spatial scales. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to measure temperature with a spatial resolution of a few centimeters over several kilometers, which can be used to measure soil moisture. This study is the first of its kind that investigates under field conditions the feasibility of combining the Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse (DPHP) technique with the DTS technology to measure soil thermal properties and variation in soil moisture. A field experiment was conducted over a 30 m transect in the Lake Wheeler Field laboratory in Raleigh, NC. Three different DPHP sensors were constructed from combinations of different fiber optic cables and heating elements and were tested to assess their performance and the effect of their construction characteristics on their accuracy. Measurements were taken over different soil moisture conditions and the system performance was compared against independent soil water content sensors. The system was able to track changes in soil water content with a mean RMSE of 0.02 m(3) m(-3) using the optimal DPHP sensor. The key advantage of the tested system is that it does not need any site-specific calibrations typically required for other DTS-based systems. The findings of this study provide some practical information and measures that need to be taken for successful DTS-DPHP construction and application under field conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-scale-optimization-of-geomorphometric-land-surface-parameters-using-scale-standardized-gaussian-scale-space&quot;&gt;Local scale optimization of geomorphometric land surface parameters using scale-standardized Gaussian scale-space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is long recognized that the processes that define the shape of the landscape operate at specific scales, and that mismatch between the scale of analysis and the scale of the process leads to erroneous results. A priori knowledge is often used in specific applications when appropriate scales are known; otherwise selecting an optimal scale of analysis has proven much more challenging. Existing attempts to address scale optimization treat scale as a spatially stationary parameter, and often rely on the generation and analysis of large volumes of data. This research introduces a method to represent topographically complex information at locally optimized scales. A constant time Gaussian scale-space implementation is used to manipulate topographic structure prior to the computation of local derivatives, followed by scale-standardization to facilitate cross-scale comparison. The method demonstrates how Gaussian smoothing can be used to efficiently explore the scaling characteristics of many topographic metrics, and how scale-standardization facilitates the identification of characteristic scales. The spatial distributions of the optimal scale and both the measured value and scale-standardized value measured at the optimal scale provide new information with which to characterize topography. These data improve topographic characterization while eliminating the redundancy of homogenous scale representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-do-cover-crops-reduce-nitrate-leaching-a-global-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;When do cover crops reduce nitrate leaching? A global meta-analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global increases in the surface and groundwater nitrate (NO3-) concentrations due to synthetic fertilizer input have emerged as major sustainability threats to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Cover crops can reportedly reduce nitrate leaching from croplands. However, the underlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of cover crops in reducing nitrate leaching across species, soil types, agronomic management, and climates remain elusive. We conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of cover crops on nitrate leaching and water drainage. A random-effects analysis was established to investigate seven moderating variables in 41 articles. Results showed that globally, cover crops reduced nitrate leaching by 69% compared with fallow while demonstrating no effect on water drainage. Overall, cover crops from Brassicaceae and Poaceae families showed the greatest effect with 75% and 52% reduction in nitrate leaching, respectively. Cover cropping on Ultisols, Histosols, and Inceptisols resulted in the greatest reduction in nitrate leaching (77%, 78%, and 77%, respectively). Greater efficacy of cover crops at reducing nitrate leaching was evident with increasing soil sand content. In general, cover crops appeared to perform better to reduce nitrate leaching in vegetable systems compared to field crops. Cover cropping on conventional tillage resulted in a 63% reduction in nitrate leaching compared with no-tillage (50%) and reduced tillage (38%) systems. The impact of cover crops on water drainage was nonsignificant which implies that nitrate leaching control by cover crops is unlikely exerted through reducing water drainage. This study brings further insight into the intrinsic factors affecting cover crop efficacy and management practices that enhance cover crop potential in reducing nitrate leaching from agricultural systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-a-landmark-1991-article-on-soil-structure-distinct-precedence-of-non-destructive-assessment-and-benefits-of-fresh-perspectives-in-soil-research&quot;&gt;Lessons from a landmark 1991 article on soil structure: distinct precedence of non-destructive assessment and benefits of fresh perspectives in soil research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, at the launch of a national symposium devoted to soil structure, the Australian Society of Soil Science invited Professor John Letey to deliver a keynote address, which was later published in the society’s journal. In his lecture, he shared the outcome of his reflexion about what the assessment of soil structure should amount to, in order to produce useful insight into the functioning of soils. His viewpoint was that the focus should be put on the openings present in the structure, rather than on the chunks of material resulting from its mechanical dismantlement. In the present article, we provide some historical background for Letey’s analysis, and try to explain why it took a number of years for the paradigm shift that he advocated to begin to occur. Over the last decade, his perspective that soil structure needs to be characterised via nondestructive methods appears to have gained significant momentum, which is likely to increase further in the near future, as we take advantage of recent technological advances. Other valuable lessons that one can derive from Letey’s pioneering article relate to the extreme value for everyone, even neophytes, to constantly ask questions about where research on given topics is heading, what its goals are, and whether the methods that are used at a certain time are optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development-of-a-crop-water-use-monitoring-system-using-electromagnetic-induction-survey&quot;&gt;Development of a crop water use monitoring system using electromagnetic induction survey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring soil water use at the plot level is essential for studying the plant’s response to drought or irrigation. However, the current soil monitoring system using moisture sensors is impractical. Soil electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys can be a rapid, convenient, and non-invasive solution for monitoring soil moisture changes at the plot level. This study developed a crop water use monitoring system for the plot level using an EMI instrument that collects measurements at 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 cm above the ground surface. The EMI data were converted to bulk soil electrical conductivity (sigma) to the depth 1.5 m via an inversion technique and correlated with measured volumetric moisture contents. The EMI system was first tested for variation in ambient temperature. Within the temperature range of 25.5-34 degrees C, the standard deviation varied between 0.84 and 3.45 mS m-1 with coefficient of variations 1.54-9.26%. The system was then tested on a field trial at Narrabri, New South Wales, Australia, to measure the water use of chickpea genotypes grown over a season. The total water use of chickpeas obtained from EMI surveys correlated highly with values obtained from the Neutron Moisture Meter (NMM) (R2 = 0.73). Time-series of water content, as measured by the EMI survey, could differentiate the water use of different genotypes. In conclusion, the EMI survey is an efficient technique for monitoring crop water use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, rapid urbanization and industrialization have caused severe damage to the agro-ecological environment, such as heavy metal pollution of soil, eutrophication, and pollution of water, and excessive harmful substances in crops. Traditional atomic spectroscopy detection techniques, like atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS), atomic mass spectrometry (AMS), and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRFS), enable high-quality detection of agricultural pollution, but they are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technology is widely applied in agro-ecological monitoring because of its strengths in situ and non-destructive, no (little) sample pre-processing, fast and accurate. This review summarizes the applications of LIBS in agriculture in the last five years from 2017 to 2021. The detailed contents of the review are as follow: (a) analysis of soil and fertilizers elemental composition, (b) water quality detection, and (c) pests, diseases, and elements in crops. Lastly, the challenges and developing prospects of LIBS in agriculture are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;confronting-the-water-potential-information-gap&quot;&gt;Confronting the water potential information gap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water potential directly controls the function of leaves, roots and microbes, and gradients in water potential drive water flows throughout the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Notwithstanding its clear relevance for many ecosystem processes, soil water potential is rarely measured in situ, and plant water potential observations are generally discrete, sparse, and not yet aggregated into accessible databases. These gaps limit our conceptual understanding of biophysical responses to moisture stress and inject large uncertainty into hydrologic and land-surface models. Here, we outline the conceptual and predictive gains that could be made with more continuous and discoverable observations of water potential in soils and plants. We discuss improvements to sensor technologies that facilitate in situ characterization of water potential, as well as strategies for building new networks that aggregate water potential data across sites. We end by highlighting novel opportunities for linking more representative site-level observations of water potential to remotely sensed proxies. Together, these considerations offer a road map for clearer links between ecohydrological processes and the water potential gradients that have the ‘potential’ to substantially reduce conceptual and modelling uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous and discoverable observations of water potential could vastly improve understanding of biophysical processes throughout the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and are achievable thanks to recent technological advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-accessible-theory-in-ecology-and-evolution-insights-from-cognitive-load-theory&quot;&gt;Writing Accessible Theory in Ecology and Evolution: Insights from Cognitive Load Theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories underpin science. In biology, theories are often formalized in the form of mathematical models, which may render them inaccessible to those lacking mathematical training. In the present article, we consider how theories could be presented to better aid understanding. We provide concrete recommendations inspired by cognitive load theory, a branch of psychology that addresses impediments to knowledge acquisition. We classify these recommendations into two classes: those that increase the links between new and existing information and those that reduce unnecessary or irrelevant complexities. For each, we provide concrete examples to illustrate the scenarios in which they apply. By enhancing a reader’s familiarity with the material, these recommendations lower the mental capacity required to learn new information. Our hope is that these recommendations can provide a pathway for theoreticians to increase the accessibility of their work and for empiricists to engage with theory, strengthening the feedback between theory and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lasting-effects-of-soil-compaction-on-soil-water-regime-confirmed-by-geoelectrical-monitoring&quot;&gt;Lasting Effects of Soil Compaction on Soil Water Regime Confirmed by Geoelectrical Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its importance for hydrological and ecological soil functioning, characterizing, and quantifying soil structure in the field remains a challenge. Traditional characterization of soil structure often relies on point measurements, more recently, we advanced the use of minimally invasive geophysical methods that operate at plot-field scales and provide information under natural conditions. In this study, we expand the application using geoelectrical and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) monitoring of soil water dynamics to infer impacts of compaction on soil structure and function. We developed a modeling scheme combining a new pedophysical model of soil electrical conductivity and a soil-structure-informed one-dimensional water flow and heat-transfer model. The model was used to interpret Direct Current (DC)-resistivity and TDR monitoring data in compacted soils at the Soil Structure Observatory (SSO) located in the vicinity of Zurich, Switzerland. We find that (1) soil compaction leads to a persistent decrease in soil electrical resistivity and (2) that compacted soils are typically drier than non-compacted soils during long drying events. The main decrease in electrical resistivity is attributed to decreasing macroporosity and increasing connectivity of soil aggregates due to compaction. Higher water losses in compacted soils are explained in terms of enhanced evaporation. Our work advances characterization of soil structure at the field scale with electrical methods by offering a physically based explanation of the impact of soil compaction on electrical properties and by interpreting DC-resistivity data in terms of soil water dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-device-to-simulate-contaminant-transfer-and-surface-and-subsurface-flow-through-intact-soil-monoliths&quot;&gt;A device to simulate contaminant transfer and surface and subsurface flow through intact soil monoliths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many contaminants of agricultural origin are released into rural environments, particularly at the soil surface. Their fate has been extensively investigated in repacked soils, but only few studies have addressed their transport in structurally preserved natural soils. Much remains unknown about their fate and transfer within and between environmental compartments, while the susceptibility of these compartments to the contaminants adverse effects can vary considerably. The lack of studies regarding surface and subsurface transfer of contaminants through intact soil compared with studies on repacked soil led us to propose a device and protocol for sampling intact soil monoliths (60 x 30 x 22 cm(3), length, width, depth [LWD]) without heavy machinery. This is achieved by a modular design with removable top and bottom lid and a protocol of cutting the soil and replacing the affected bottom soil with a drainage layer of glass beads. The device allows the application of artificial rainfall events with simultaneous highly resolved quantification of infiltration excess overland flow and drainage discharge. It is designed to facilitate the collection of samples for physical, biological, and chemical analyses that fulfill cleanliness standards for organic contaminant analysis at trace levels using only poorly reactive stainless steel and glass materials. Testing of the device was performed by measuring the transfer of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin (IVM) through and over a silt-loam pasture soil. This test case illustrates how the device can be used to gain valuable information on the transfer of trace organic contaminants through topsoils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-global-1-km-downscaled-smap-soil-moisture-product-based-on-thermal-inertia-theory&quot;&gt;A global 1-km downscaled SMAP soil moisture product based on thermal inertia theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microwave remote sensing technology has been applied to produce soil moisture (SM) retrievals on a global scale for various studies and applications. However, due to the limitations of current technology, the native spatial resolution of currently available passive microwave SM products is on the order of tens of kilometers, and this resolution cannot be used to characterize SM variability on a regional scale. To overcome this limitation, a downscaling algorithm based on the thermal inertia theory-derived relationship between SM and temperature difference was developed using outputs from the Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah Land Surface Model and the land long-term data record-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset and applied to the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land surface temperature/NDVI data to produce a downscaled 1-km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer daily SM product, respectively, at 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on a global scale from 2015 to 2020. The evaluation results reveal that the downscaling model performs better in the middle or low latitudes than in high latitudes. It also performs better in warm months than in cold months. The in situ SM observations from dense networks around the world were used to validate the 1-km and enhanced 9-km SMAP SM data. The validation metrics indicated that both the 1-km and 9-km SM data have overall overestimation trends, and the unbiased RMSE (0.063 m(3) m(-3) on average), mean absolute error (0.052 m(3) m(-3) on average), and spatial standard deviation (0.025 m(3) m(-3) on average) of the 1 km data are generally more accurate than the metrics of the 9-km SM data, which indicates that the downscaled data provide reliable observed SM information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Soil moisture as an essential component for delineating and forecasting agricultural rather than meteorological drought&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rapid intensification of the emerging southwestern North American megadrought in 2020-2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rapid-intensification-of-the-emerging-southwestern-north-american-megadrought-in-2020-2021&quot;&gt;Rapid intensification of the emerging southwestern North American megadrought in 2020-2021&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southwestern North America has been experiencing lower than average precipitation and higher temperatures since 2000. This emerging megadrought, spanning 2000-2021, has been the driest 22-year period since the year 800 and 19% of the drought severity in 2021 can be attributed to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previous reconstruction back to 800 ce indicated that the 2000-2018 soil moisture deficit in southwestern North America was exceeded during one megadrought in the late-1500s. Here, we show that after exceptional drought severity in 2021, similar to 19% of which is attributable to anthropogenic climate trends, 2000-2021 was the driest 22-yr period since at least 800. This drought will very likely persist through 2022, matching the duration of the late-1500s megadrought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-moisture-as-an-essential-component-for-delineating-and-forecasting-agricultural-rather-than-meteorological-drought&quot;&gt;Soil moisture as an essential component for delineating and forecasting agricultural rather than meteorological drought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drought is a recurring, complex, and extreme climatic phenomenon characterized by subnormal precipitation for months to years triggering negative impacts on agriculture, energy, tourism, recreation, and transportation sectors. Agricultural drought assessment is based on a deficit of soil moisture (SM) during the plant-growing season, whereas meteorological drought corresponds to subnormal precipitation over months to years. However, satellite-derived agricultural and meteorological drought indices (including those comprising root-zone SM) have not been comprehensively compared to evaluate their ability for drought delineation and particularly forecasting across climate regimes, land cover and soil types, and irrigation management (irrigated vs. rainfed) in the contiguous USA (CONUS). Here, we did so from 2015 to 2019 within the CONUS. In most regions except the US Midwest and Southeast, SM-based indices (e.g., Palmer Z, SMAP, SWDI) delineated agricultural drought better than meteorological (e.g., SPI, SPEI) and hybrid (Comprehensive Drought Index, CDI) drought indices. In contrast, the SPI and SPEI showed strong correlation with the aridity index in most part of the CONUS except the Midwest. SM-based and hybrid indices also demonstrated skills for agricultural drought forecasting (represented by end-of-year cumulative GPP), predominantly in the early growing season and particularly in irrigated rather than rainfed croplands. These findings indicate the leading role of SM in controlling ecosystem dryness and confirm “drought memory”, possibly due to SM-memory in land-atmosphere coupling. Proper application of meteorological and agricultural drought indices and their contrasting spatial-temporal controls on plant growth and ecosystem dryness has the potential to improve our understanding of drought evolution and provide early drought forecasting across large regions with diverse climate regimes, land cover types, soil textural classes, and irrigation management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;farming-and-earth-observation-sentinel-2-data-to-estimate-within-field-wheat-grain-yield&quot;&gt;Farming and Earth Observation: Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat grain yield&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wheat grain yield (GY) is a crop feature of central importance affecting agricultural, environmental, and socioeconomic sustainability worldwide. Hence, the estimation of within-field variability of GY is pivotal for the agricultural management, especially in the current global change context. In this sense, Earth Observation Systems (EOS) are key technologies that use satellite data to monitor crop yield, which can guide the application of precision farming. Yet, novel research is required to improve the multiplatform integration of data, including data processing, and the application of this discipline in agricultural management. This article provides a novel methodological analysis and assessment of its applications in precision farming. It presents an integration of wheat GY, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), combine harvester data, and EOS Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. Moreover, it compares several indices and machine learning (ML) approaches to map within-field wheat GY. It also analyses the importance of multi-date remote sensing imagery and explores its potential applications in precision agriculture. The study was conducted in Spain, a major European wheat producer. Within-field GY data was obtained from a GPS combine harvester machine for 8 fields over three seasons (2017-2019) and consecutively processed to match Sentinel-2 10 m pixel size. Seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, RVI, TGI, CVI and NGRDI) as well as the biophysical parameter LAI (leaf area index) retrieved with radiative transfer models (RTM) were calculated from Sentinel-2 bands. Sentinel-2 10 m resolution bands alone were also used as variables. Random forest, support vector machine and boosted regressions were used as modelling approaches, and multilinear regression was calculated as baseline. Different combinations of dates of measurement were tested to find the most suitable model feeding data. LAI retrieved from RTM had a slightly improved performance in estimating within-field GY in comparison with vegetation indices or Sentinel-2 bands alone. At validation, the use of multi-date Sentinel-2 data was found to be the most suitable in comparison with single date images. Thus, the model developed with random forest regression (e.g. R-2 = 0.89, and RSME = 0.74 t/ha when using LAI) outperformed support vector machine (R-2 = 0.84 and RSME = 0.92 t/ha), boosting regression (R-2 = 0.85 and RSME = 0.88 t/ha) and multilinear regression (R-2 = 0.69 and RSME = 1.29 t/ha). However, single date images at specific phenological stages (e.g. R-2 = 0.84, and RSME = 0.88 t/ha using random forest at stem elongation) also posed relatively high R-2 and low RMSE, with potential for precision farming management before harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fuzzy-map-comparisons-enable-objective-hydro-morphodynamic-model-validation&quot;&gt;Fuzzy map comparisons enable objective hydro-morphodynamic model validation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerical modeling represents a state-of-the-art technique to simulate hydro-morphodynamic processes in river ecosystems. Numerical models are often validated based on observed topographic change in the form of pixel information on net erosion or deposition over a simulation period. When model validation is performed by a pixel-by-pixel comparison of exactly superimposed simulated and observed pixels, zero or negative correlation coefficients are often calculated, suggesting poor model performance. Thus, a pixel-by-pixel approach penalizes quantitative simulation errors, even if a model conceptually works well. To distinguish between reasonably well-performing and non-representative models, this study introduces and tests fuzzy map comparison methods. First, we use a fuzzy numerical map comparison to compensate for spatial offset errors in correlation analyses. Second, we add a level of fuzziness with a fuzzy kappa map comparison to additionally address quantitative inaccuracy in modeled topographic change by categorizing data. Sample datasets from a physical lab model and datasets from a 6.9 km long gravel-cobble bed river reach enable the verification of the relevance of fuzzy map comparison methods. The results indicate that a fuzzy numerical map comparison is a viable technique to compensate for model errors stemming from spatial offset. In addition, fuzzy kappa map comparisons are suitable for objectively expressing subjectively perceived correlation between two maps, provided that a small number of categories is used. The methods tested and the resulting spatially explicit comparison maps represent a significant opportunity to improve the evaluation and potential calibration of numerical models of river ecosystems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-depth-to-pleistocene-sand-with-bayesian-generalized-linear-geostatistical-models&quot;&gt;Mapping depth to Pleistocene sand with Bayesian generalized linear geostatistical models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spatial soil applications frequently involve binomial variables. If relevant environmental covariates are available, using a Bayesian generalized linear model (BGLM) might be a solution for mapping such discrete soil properties. The geostatistical extension, a Bayesian generalized linear geostatistical model (BGLGM), adds spatial dependence and is thus potentially better equipped. The objective of this work was to evaluate whether it pays off to extend from a BGLM to a BGLGM for mapping binary soil properties, evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy and modelling complexity. As motivating example, we mapped the presence/absence of the Pleistocene sand layer within 120 cm from the land surface in the Dutch province of Flevoland, using the BGLGM implementation in the R-package geoRglm. We found that BGLGM yields considerably better statistical validation metrics compared to a BGLM, especially with - as in our case - a large (n = 1,000) observation sample and few relevant covariates available. Also, the inferred posterior BGLGM parameters enable the quantification of spatial relationships. However, calibrating and applying a BGLGM is quite demanding with respect to the minimal required sample size, tuning the algorithm, and computational costs. We replaced manual tuning by an automated tuning algorithm (which eases implementing applications) and found a sample composition that delivers meaningful results within 50 h calculation time. With the gained insights and shared scripts spatial soil practitioners and researchers can - for their specific cases - evaluate if using BGLGM is feasible and if the extra gain is worth the extra effort. Highlights Does adding spatial correlation to a Bayesian GLM for mapping a binary soil variable pay off? We aim to make spatial Bayesian hierarchical modelling accessible for pedometricians. Most hierarchical models work well when enough observations are provided, even without covariates. Including spatial correlation might sometimes be worth the extra effort and computational costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cost-effectiveness-of-reflectance-spectroscopy-for-estimating-soil-organic-carbon&quot;&gt;The cost-effectiveness of reflectance spectroscopy for estimating soil organic carbon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflectance spectra of soil can be used to estimate the concentrations of organic carbon in soil (SOC). The estimates are more or less imprecise, but spectroscopy is quicker, less laborious and cheaper than conventional dry combustion analysis. Are the greater economy and efficiency sufficient to justify the loss of information arising from errors in estimation? We measured soil spectra with three instruments: a bench-top mid-infrared (mid-IR) (mid-IRb) spectrometer, a portable mid-IR (mid-IRp) spectrometer and a portable visible-near infrared (vis-NIRp) spectrometer. We calculated a quantity E to express the cost-effectiveness of spectroscopic estimates relative to the conventional analysis, by accounting for their inaccuracy, their cost and their capacity, namely the maximum number of samples that can be prepared and measured daily. In all, 562 samples of soil were collected from 150 locations at four depths on a farm. The samples were dried and ground to particle sizes of &amp;lt;= 2 and &amp;lt;= 0.5 mm before measurements were made by dry-combustion analysis. The machine learning algorithm Cubist was used to derive spectroscopic models of SOC concentrations and their uncertainties. We found that the mid-IRb on the &amp;lt;= 0.5 mm samples was the most accurate and expensive but nevertheless sufficiently cost-effective (large value of E) for determining the organic C. The mid-IRp was somewhat more accurate, but its E was smaller than vis-NIRp on corresponding samples because it required more time to record the spectra. We also found that, with the portable spectrometers, the SOC predictions made on the &amp;lt;= 0.5 mm samples were somewhat more accurate than those made on the &amp;lt;= 2 mm samples, but their E was smaller because of the additional cost of sample preparation. The vis-NIRp on the &amp;lt;= 2 mm samples was the most cost-effective for estimating SOC because it is cheap, accurate and has a large capacity for measurements. Highlights Concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC) were determined by standard dry combustion and estimated from reflectance spectra recorded by three instruments. The labour required for each of the techniques and the cost, including that of the equipment, were recorded. A quantity E, expressing the cost-effectiveness relative to dry combustion was calculated for each spectral technique, taking into account both accuracy and cost. Dry combustion was always more accurate than estimates from spectra for individual samples, and the technique was also more cost-effective for small numbers of samples. The cost-effectiveness of the spectral techniques varied among themselves, but all were more cost-effective than dry combustion for large numbers of samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;statistical-modelling-of-measurement-error-in-wet-chemistry-soil-data&quot;&gt;Statistical modelling of measurement error in wet chemistry soil data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing demand for high-quality soil data. However, soil measurements are subject to many error sources. We aimed to quantify uncertainties in synthetic and real-world wet chemistry soil data through a linear mixed-effects model, including batch and laboratory effects. The use of synthetic data allowed us to investigate how accurately the model parameters were estimated for various experimental measurement designs, whereas the real-world case served to explore if estimates of the random effect variances were still accurate for unbalanced datasets with few replicates. The variance estimates for synthetic pHH2O data were unbiased, but limited laboratory information led to imprecise estimates. The same was observed for unbalanced synthetic datasets, where 20, 50 and 80% of the data were removed randomly. Removal led to a sharp increase of the interquartile range (IQR) of the variance estimates for batch effect and the residual. The model was also fitted to real-world pHH2O and total organic carbon (TOC) data, provided by the Wageningen Evaluating Programmes for Analytical Laboratories (WEPAL). For pHH2O, the model yielded unbiased estimates with relatively small IQRs. However, the limited number of batches with replicate measurements (5.8%) caused the batch effect to be larger than expected. A strong negative correlation between batch effect and residual variance suggested that the model could not distinguish well between these two random effects. For TOC, batch effect was removed from the model as no replicates were available within batches. Again, unbiased model estimates were obtained. However, the IQRs were relatively large, which could be attributed to the smaller dataset with only a single replicate measurement. Our findings demonstrated the importance of experimental measurement design and replicate measurements in the quantification of uncertainties in wet chemistry soil data. Highlights Accurate uncertainty quantification depends on the experimental measurement design. Linear mixed-effects models can be used as a tool to quantify uncertainty in wet chemistry soil data. Lack of replicate measurements leads to poor estimates of error variance components. Measurement error in wet chemistry soil data should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russell-review-are-plant-roots-only-in-soil-or-are-they-of-it-roots-soil-formation-and-function&quot;&gt;RUSSELL REVIEW Are plant roots only “in” soil or are they “of” it? Roots, soil formation and function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roots are near-ubiquitous components of soils globally but have often been regarded as separate from the soil rather than a substantial factor in determining what soil is and how it functions. The start of rapid soil formation commenced about 400 million years ago with the emergence of vascular plants and the evolution of roots and associated microbes. Roots and associated microorganisms contribute significantly to soil formation by altering rocks and soil minerals through a variety of biogeochemical processes and supply carbon to a depth that can have long residence times. Living root inputs of carbon via rhizodeposits are more efficient than shoot and root litter inputs in forming slow-cycling, mineral-associated soil organic carbon pools. The current functionality of soils in providing food and fuel and fibres, supplying plant nutrients, filtering water and flood regulation, and disease suppression are all dependent on the activities of plant roots. Roots are actively communicating and collaborating with other organisms for mutual benefit, and the signals underlying this modulation of the rhizosphere microbiome are being identified. In this review I examine how plant roots (an organ not an organism) affect soil formation and function and conclude that, from several perspectives, roots are not just “in” soil but “of” it and that definitions of soil should recognise this. A possible definition is: “Soils are altered surficial rock or sediment, composed of organic matter, minerals, fluids, and organisms whose formation and functionality are influenced by biogeochemical weathering and interactions of these components with plant roots.” Highlights Paleoclimatic and paleosoil research shows the key role of roots and mycorrhiza in soil formation. Deep roots and living root inputs are substantial contributors to long-term C storage. Root/microbe signalling facilitates mutualistic symbioses, nutrient uptake and disease suppression. Definitions of soil should explicitly include roots as an important component of the soil system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-simple-method-for-estimating-the-optimum-water-content-for-tillage&quot;&gt;A simple method for estimating the optimum water content for tillage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple and quick determination of the optimum water content for tillage (theta(OPT)) is helpful to guide tillage operations. Based on the definition of theta(OPT) that is the water content at the inflection point of the soil water retention curve, a simple method was established to estimate the theta(OPT) from saturated water content (theta(s)) (theta(OPT) = 0.75 theta(s)). The validation results on 132 soils with varying texture showed that the root mean squared error and mean error were 0.021 and 0.009 g g(-1), respectively. These results confirmed that the theta(s) was valuable information for estimating theta(OPT) and the proposed method could give a reasonable estimation for theta(OPT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-soil-chemical-properties-by-diffuse-reflectance-spectroscopy-promise-versus-reality&quot;&gt;Estimating soil chemical properties by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy: Promise versus reality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral range has increasingly been utilised in recent years to measure soil properties, including organic carbon and macronutrient content, cation exchange capacity, pH, and even trace metal concentration. Proponents have even suggested that conventional laboratory soil testing methods can ultimately be replaced by these less laborious and more rapid spectroscopic methods. However, to this point in time, reflectance spectroscopy has not demonstrated accuracy comparable to that of conventional physical-chemical testing methods. This review explains why correlations between VNIR spectral features and specific chemical properties within selected sets of soil samples are indirect at best and therefore cannot be trusted more universally to predict soil chemical properties in larger and less homogeneous sample sets. Because mathematical manipulation of the raw spectral data has become increasingly complex and obscure to the users, particularly when machine learning is employed, the possibility exists that the correlations found and the predictions made are based on chance relationships resulting from overfitting the spectral data to include random noise in addition to any real trends. It is concluded that, for real-world soil testing for agronomic and environmental purposes (e.g. available nutrient and trace metal levels), spectral reflectance methods are not sufficiently reliable to replace conventional testing. Conversely, these reflectance methods show utility and convenience in measuring general trends across landscapes in levels of soil organic matter, carbonates, soluble salts and specific clay minerals. Highlights VNIR reflectance spectroscopy is reviewed as a method to measure soil properties. Estimating most soil chemical properties by VNIR relies on indirect or proxy correlations. Complex regression models used in predicting soil properties may overstate accuracy. Reflectance spectroscopy has lower reliability and extrapolability than conventional soil testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-profile-analysis-using-interactive-visualizations-machine-learning-and-deep-learning&quot;&gt;Soil profile analysis using interactive visualizations, machine learning, and deep learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil is an essential element of life, and soil properties are crucial in analyzing soil health. Recent developments of proximal sensor technologies, such as portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectroscopy or visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy, offer rapid and non-destructive alternatives for quantifying data from soil profiles. While the data collection time using these technologies decreases significantly, the subsequent analysis remains time-consuming, and current analysis solutions only provide basic visualizations. Furthermore, the use of collected data from proximal sensors to predict high-level soil properties has garnered worldwide attention in the past decade, owing to its convenience. Therefore, this paper discusses the objectives for software solutions in this area, consolidated from interviewing 102 stakeholders. Following these requirements, data visualizers work closely with soil scientists to propose a set of interactive visualizations for analyzing soil profiles using pXRF data. These interactive visualizations receive positive feedback from the domain experts. This project also explores various machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict soil properties from spectral data. This work then proposes a deep learning model called RDNet that achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting pH(H2O) and pH(KCl) from Vis-NIR spectra acquired from a set of globally distributed soil samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;century-long-changes-and-drivers-of-soil-nitrous-oxide-n2o-emissions-across-the-contiguous-united-states&quot;&gt;Century-long changes and drivers of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions across the contiguous United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) has increased by 23% since the pre-industrial era, which substantially destructed the stratospheric ozone layer and changed the global climate. However, it remains uncertain about the reasons behind the increase and the spatiotemporal patterns of soil N2O emissions, a primary biogenic source. Here, we used an integrative land ecosystem model, Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), to quantify direct (i.e., emitted from local soil) and indirect (i.e., emissions related to local practices but occurring elsewhere) N2O emissions in the contiguous United States during 1900-2019. Newly developed geospatial data of land-use history and crop-specific agricultural management practices were used to force DLEM at a spatial resolution of 5 arc-min by 5 arc-min. The model simulation indicates that the U.S. soil N2O emissions totaled 0.97 +/- 0.06 Tg N year(-1) during the 2010s, with 94% and 6% from direct and indirect emissions, respectively. Hot spots of soil N2O emission are found in the US Corn Belt and Rice Belt. We find a threefold increase in total soil N2O emission in the United States since 1900, 74% of which is from agricultural soil emissions, increasing by 12 times from 0.04 Tg N year(-1) in the 1900s to 0.51 Tg N year(-1) in the 2010s. More than 90% of soil N2O emission increase in agricultural soils is attributed to human land-use change and agricultural management practices, while increases in N deposition and climate warming are the dominant drivers for N2O emission increase from natural soils. Across the cropped acres, corn production stands out with a large amount of fertilizer consumption and high-emission factors, responsible for nearly two-thirds of direct agricultural soil N2O emission increase since 1900. Our study suggests a large N2O mitigation potential in cropland and the importance of exploring crop-specific mitigation strategies and prioritizing management alternatives for targeted crop types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-energy-to-soil-organic-matter&quot;&gt;From energy to (soil organic) matter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this concept paper, we propose a new view on soil organic matter (SOM) formation: microorganisms use most of the organics entering the soil as energy rather than as a source of carbon (C), while SOM accumulates as a residual by-product because the microbial energy investment in its decomposition exceeds the energy gain. During the initial stages of decomposition, the nominal oxidation state of C (NOSC) in remaining litter decreases, and the energy content increases. This reflects the rapid mineralization of available compounds with positive and neutral NOSC (carboxylic acids, sugars, some amino acids). Consequently, the NOSC of the remaining compounds drops to -0.3 units, and the oxidation rate decreases due to the residual relative accumulation of aromatic and aliphatic compounds (which are hydrolized later) and entombment of the necromass. Ultimately, incompletely decomposed plant residues will have 1%-2.5% more energy per C unit than the initial litter. The linear decrease in energy density of a broad range of organic substances by 106 kJ mol(-1) C per NOSC unit upon oxidation is supported by experimental data on litter decomposition. Preferential recycling of energy-rich reduced (lipids, aromatics, certain amino acids, amino sugars) and the microbial degradation of oxidized compounds (carboxylic acids) also energetically enrich SOM. Despite the high energy content, the availability of energy stored in SOM is lower than in litter. This explains why SOM is not fully mineralized (thermodynamically unfavorable), especially in the absence of plant C to provide new energy (e.g., in bare soil). Energy from litter activates decomposers to mine nutrients stored in SOM (the main ecological function of priming effects) because the nutrient content in SOM is 2-5 times higher than that of litter. This results in only 0.4%-5% year(-1) of litter-derived C being sequestered in SOM, whereas SOM stores 1%-10% year(-1) of the total litter-derived energy. Thus, the energy captured by photosynthesis is the main reason why microorganisms utilize organic matter, whereby SOM is merely a residual by-product of nutrient storage and a mediator of energy fluxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key variable to determine soil functioning, ecosystem services, and global carbon cycles. Spectroscopy, particularly optical hyperspectral reflectance coupled with machine learning, can provide rapid, efficient, and cost-effective quantification of SOC. However, how to exploit soil hyperspectral reflectance to predict SOC concentration, and the potential performance of airborne and satellite data for predicting surface SOC at large scales remain relatively underknown. This study utilized a continental-scale soil laboratory spectral library (37,540 full-pedon 350-2500 nm reflectance spectra with SOC concentration of 0-780 g.kg(-1) across the US) to thoroughly evaluate seven machine learning algorithms including Partial-Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) along with four preprocessed spectra, i.e. original, vector normalization, continuum removal, and first-order derivative, to quantify SOC concentration. Furthermore, by using the coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere radiative transfer model, we simulated twelve airborne and spaceborne hyper/multi-spectral remote sensing data from surface bare soil laboratory spectra to evaluate their potential for estimating SOC concentration of surface bare soils. Results show that LSTM achieved best predictive performance of quantifying SOC concentration for the whole data sets (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 30.81 g.kg(-1)), mineral soils (SOC &amp;lt;= 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 10.60 g.kg(-1)), and organic soils (SOC &amp;gt; 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 62.31 g.kg(-1)). Spectral data preprocessing, particularly the first-order derivative, improved the performance of PLSR, RF, Ridge, KNN, and ANN, but not LSTM or CNN. We found that the SOC models of mineral and organic soils should be distinguished given their distinct spectral signatures. Finally, we identified that the shortwave infrared is vital for airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors to monitor surface SOC. This study highlights the high accuracy of LSTM with hyperspectral/multispectral data to mitigate a certain level of noise (soil moisture &amp;lt;0.4 m(3).m(-3), green leaf area &amp;lt; 0.3 m(2).m(-2), plant residue &amp;lt;0.4 m(2).m(-2)) for quantifying surface SOC concentration. Forthcoming satellite hyperspectral missions like Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) have a high potential for future global soil carbon monitoring, while high-resolution satellite multispectral fusion data can be an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-moisture-retrieval-over-croplands-using-dual-pol-l-band-grd-sar-data&quot;&gt;Soil moisture retrieval over croplands using dual-pol L-band GRD SAR data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vegetation cover significantly influences the hydrometeorological processes of land surfaces. The heterogeneity of vegetation cover makes these processes more complex and impacts the interaction between water held in the soil matrix and vegetation cover. The backscatter measured by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is sensitive to target dielectric and morphological properties. In addition, SAR acquisitions are weather-independent, providing a major advantage over optical imaging during periods of cloud cover. Most often, vegetation properties are measured using vegetation indices, including simple ratios of backscatter intensities. However, this approach can miss the scattered wave purity from vegetation targets. The scattered wave characteristic is an essential parameter as it is susceptible to the complex random structure of vegetation. In this study, we propose a novel dual-polarimetric SAR vegetation descriptor based on the co-pol purity component of the wave. We use this descriptor within a semi-empirical vegetation model to estimate soil moisture. It is noteworthy that this proposed method to retrieve soil moisture uses only the dual-polarimetric Ground Range Detected (GRD) SAR product, i.e., only backscatter intensities. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential for operational scale monitoring applications at a global scale. This study validated different crop types (viz. canola, oats, forage, maize, soybeans, sugar beet, wheat, winter wheat, winter barley) over two test sites using airborne SAR data. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for soil moisture are within the range of 4.3% to 7.7% with the Pearson correlation coefficient r greater than 0.6. This novel descriptor will facilitate the operational use of dual-polarimetric GRD SAR data for vegetation monitoring and soil moisture estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advances-in-gas-sensors-and-electronic-nose-technologies-for-agricultural-cycle-applications&quot;&gt;Advances in gas sensors and electronic nose technologies for agricultural cycle applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural cycle is the annual cycle of activities for planting and harvesting. The global warming and climate change currently cause serious impacts on the agricultural cycle leading to reduced crop quantity and quality. In the past decade, the gas sensors and electronic nose (E-nose) technologies have shown great promise and utility in monitoring and prediction of important parameters related to the growth and harvest of a crop. This review summarizes overall the evolution of utilizing gas sensors and E-nose technologies for guideline of agricultural best management practices including applications on cultivation preparation, crop production, harvesting and storage of crops. Advantages and limitations of these technologies in agricultural applications are reviewed to highlight potential research directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimal-smart-contract-for-autonomous-greenhouse-environment-based-on-iot-blockchain-network-in-agriculture&quot;&gt;Optimal smart contract for autonomous greenhouse environment based on IoT blockchain network in agriculture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely adopted in many smart applications such as smart cities, healthcare, smart farms, industry etc. In recent few years, the greenhouse industry has earned significant consideration from the agriculture community due to its ability to produce fresh agricultural products with immense growth and production rate. However, labour and energy consumption costs increase the production cost of the greenhouse by 40-50% approximately. Moreover, the security and authenticity of agriculture data, particularly for yield monitoring and analysis, is also a challenging issue in current greenhouse systems.The greenhouse require optimal parameter settings with controlled environment to produce increase food production. Therefore, slight advancement can bring remarkable improvements concerning the increase in production with reduced overall cost. In this work, we contributed blockchain enabled optimization approach for greenhouse system. The proposed approach works in three steps to provide optimal greenhouse environment that are; prediction, optimization, and finally controlling. Initially, the Kalman filter algorithm is employed for predicting the greenhouse sensor data. In next step, the optimal parameters are computed for the indoor greenhouse environment. Finally, the optimized parameters are utilized by the control module to operate and regulate the actuator’s state to meet the desired settings in the indoor environment. To evaluate the performance of our proposed greenhouse system, we have developed an emulation tool. The proposed system has been investigated and compared against baseline approach concerning production rate and energy consumption. The obtained results reveal that the proposed optimization approach has improved the energy consumption by 19% against the prediction based approach and 41% against the Baseline scheme. Furthermore, the proof-of-concept based on the Hyperledger Fabric network is implemented on the top of the proposed greenhouse platform. For experimental analysis, we have conducted a series of experiments using Hyperledger calliper concerning throughput, latency, and resource utilization. These results advocates the efficiency of the proposed optimal greenhouse system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Carbon stocks in umbric ferralsols driven by plant productivity and geomorphic processes, not by mineral protection&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transforming-food-systems-multi-stakeholder-platforms-driven-by-consumer-concerns-and-public-demands&quot;&gt;Transforming food systems: Multi-stakeholder platforms driven by consumer concerns and public demands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food systems governance for healthy and sustainable diets remains a challenge. New structures are needed to better connect food systems actors. This paper argues that existing multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) have the potential to contribute to food systems governance by facilitating linkages between actors and scales. In a nonexperimental study existing MSPs (n = 89) were explored in four countries addressing food and nutrition security. A diagnostic framework was used to identify MSP’s capacities to address governance principles like system-based problem framing, boundary spanning, adaptability, inclusiveness, and transformative capacity. Existing MSPs can play a role in spanning boundaries, thereby increasing adaptability and learning, but seem less promising in shifting to systems-based narratives and thus may have limited capacity to truly transform food systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;carbon-stocks-in-umbric-ferralsols-driven-by-plant-productivity-and-geomorphic-processes-not-by-mineral-protection&quot;&gt;Carbon stocks in umbric ferralsols driven by plant productivity and geomorphic processes, not by mineral protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umbric ferralsols (UF) have organic carbon stocks within the first 1 m of soil profile depth that are nearly double the size (similar to 19 kg Cm-2) compared to the average carbon stocks of all other ferralsols (similar to 10 kg Cm-2). Here, we investigate processes that allow UF to gain and maintain such extraordinary carbon stocks. Using the International Soil Research and Information Center database, complemented with recently published datasets, we show that the carbon saturation capacity of the clay + silt fractions in UF (22.8 +/- 5.7 g C kg(-1) soil, n = 59) does not exceed the carbon saturation capacity in other ferralsols (23.3 +/- 6.2 g C kg(-1) soil, n = 165), thus eliminating a particularly retentive mineral matrix as a possible explanation. Rather, carbon stocks were correlated with the thickness of A horizons (106 +/- 49 cm, n = 59 in umbric versus 35 +/- 22 cm, n = 165 in non-umbric ferralsols). We subsequently hypothesized that differences in A-horizon thickness arose from two pedogenic scenarios: (i) superior carbon accrual resulting from a unique vegetation cover capable of allocating large quantities of carbon to belowground plant organs; and (ii) geomorphic processes that led to carbon burial. We evaluated the plausibility of these scenarios considering landscape history and associated carbon flux rates, hillslope position, as well as delta C-13 values and Ti/Zr ratios for subsets of ferralsol profiles studied by us in a region that encompasses latitudes from 26 to 7 degrees S in eastern Brazil. We found that exceptional carbon stocks were most prevalent in the gradual transition zone (ecotone) between savanna and rainforest, likely resulting from erosion-deposition processes, historic changes of vegetation cover composed of grasses and arboreal elements, and active bioturbation. We suggest that attempts to sequester carbon in non-umbric ferralsols will be most successful if they emulate or promote the biotic and abiotic processes prevalent in the savanna/rainforest ecotone.&lt;/p&gt;

This effort synthesizes the findings of more than 130 scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Variations and controlling factors of soil denitrification rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uncovering the critical soil moisture thresholds of plant water stress for European ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variations-and-controlling-factors-of-soil-denitrification-rate&quot;&gt;Variations and controlling factors of soil denitrification rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The denitrification process profoundly affects soil nitrogen (N) availability and generates its byproduct, nitrous oxide, as a potent greenhouse gas. There are large uncertainties in predicting global denitrification because its controlling factors remain elusive. In this study, we compiled 4301 observations of denitrification rates across a variety of terrestrial ecosystems from 214 papers published in the literature. The averaged denitrification rate was 3516.3 +/- 91.1 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1). The highest denitrification rate was 4242.3 +/- 152.3 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1) under humid subtropical climates, and the lowest was 965.8 +/- 150.4 mu g N kg(-1) under dry climates. The denitrification rate increased with temperature, precipitation, soil carbon and N contents, as well as microbial biomass carbon and N, but decreased with soil clay contents. The variables related to soil N contents (e.g., nitrate, ammonium, and total N) explained the variation of denitrification more than climatic and edaphic variables (e.g., mean annual temperature (MAT), soil moisture, soil pH, and clay content) according to structural equation models. Soil microbial biomass carbon, which was influenced by soil nitrate, ammonium, and total N, also strongly influenced denitrification at a global scale. Collectively, soil N contents, microbial biomass, pH, texture, moisture, and MAT accounted for 60% of the variation in global denitrification rates. The findings suggest that soil N contents and microbial biomass are strong predictors of denitrification at the global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uncovering-the-critical-soil-moisture-thresholds-of-plant-water-stress-for-european-ecosystems&quot;&gt;Uncovering the critical soil moisture thresholds of plant water stress for European ecosystems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the critical soil moisture (SM) threshold (theta(crit)) of plant water stress and land surface energy partitioning is a basis to evaluate drought impacts and improve models for predicting future ecosystem condition and climate. Quantifying the theta(crit) across biomes and climates is challenging because observations of surface energy fluxes and SM remain sparse. Here, we used the latest database of eddy covariance measurements to estimate theta(crit) across Europe by evaluating evaporative fraction (EF)-SM relationships and investigating the covariance between vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and gross primary production (GPP) during SM dry-down periods. We found that the theta(crit) and soil matric potential threshold in Europe are 16.5% and -0.7 MPa, respectively. Surface energy partitioning characteristics varied among different vegetation types; EF in savannas had the highest sensitivities to SM in water-limited stage, and the lowest in forests. The sign of the covariance between daily VPD and GPP consistently changed from positive to negative during dry-down across all sites when EF shifted from relatively high to low values. This sign of the covariance changed after longer period of SM decline in forests than in grasslands and savannas. Estimated theta(crit) from the VPD-GPP covariance method match well with the EF-SM method, showing this covariance method can be used to detect the theta(crit). We further found that soil texture dominates the spatial variability of theta(crit) while shortwave radiation and VPD are the major drivers in determining the spatial pattern of EF sensitivities. Our results highlight for the first time that the sign change of the covariance between daily VPD and GPP can be used as an indicator of how ecosystems transition from energy to SM limitation. We also characterized the corresponding theta(crit) and its drivers across diverse ecosystems in Europe, an essential variable to improve the representation of water stress in land surface models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-enzymes-as-indicators-of-soil-function-a-step-toward-greater-realism-in-microbial-ecological-modeling&quot;&gt;Soil enzymes as indicators of soil function: A step toward greater realism in microbial ecological modeling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles and their complex responses to environmental changes have received increasing attention. However, large uncertainties in model predictions remain, partially due to the lack of explicit representation and parameterization of microbial processes. One great challenge is to effectively integrate rich microbial functional traits into ecosystem modeling for better predictions. Here, using soil enzymes as indicators of soil function, we developed a competitive dynamic enzyme allocation scheme and detailed enzyme-mediated soil inorganic N processes in the Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model. We conducted a rigorous calibration and validation of MEND with diverse soil C-N fluxes, microbial C:N ratios, and functional gene abundances from a 12-year CO2 x N grassland experiment (BioCON) in Minnesota, USA. In addition to accurately simulating soil CO2 fluxes and multiple N variables, the model correctly predicted microbial C:N ratios and their negative response to enriched N supply. Model validation further showed that, compared to the changes in simulated enzyme concentrations and decomposition rates, the changes in simulated activities of eight C-N-associated enzymes were better explained by the measured gene abundances in responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. Our results demonstrated that using enzymes as indicators of soil function and validating model predictions with functional gene abundances in ecosystem modeling can provide a basis for testing hypotheses about microbially mediated biogeochemical processes in response to environmental changes. Further development and applications of the modeling framework presented here will enable microbial ecologists to address ecosystem-level questions beyond empirical observations, toward more predictive understanding, an ultimate goal of microbial ecology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-type-of-gully-is-that-the-need-for-a-classification-of-gullies&quot;&gt;What type of gully is that? The need for a classification of gullies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite over a century of investigations into gullies and gully erosion, the characterization and categorization of gullies and the varied definitions, nomenclatures and terminology used has caused some confusion in understanding and communicating the relationships of gully forms and processes around the world. We firstly review the gully literature and highlight how a lack of consistency in gully definition and characterization prevents unifying theory from being developed within this important field of research, since it is often unclear whether different landscape features being discussed are comparable. We propose that conventionally employed qualitative planform and cross-sectional characteristics of gullies alone are inadequate to define gully types, yet both these features remain central to most modern gully descriptions. We discuss the need to revise and augment these basic characteristics with clearly defined morphogenetic attributes such as landscape context, soil material characteristics, erosion processes, hydrological integrity, modes of development, and head/side-wall morphology for an effective, practicable, generic gully classification scheme. Central to a gully classification scheme is the need for a clear definition of what a gully is - and is not - for which geomorphological criteria are proposed to differentiate a ‘gully’ from other ‘incisional land surface forms’. This gully definition hinges largely on the identification of a retreating head scarp and the internal erosion by mass-movement and other sidewall slope erosion processes, coupled with the transport of the soil materials from the gully void. By defining a gully and synthesizing descriptions of gully ‘types’ from the literature and our own experience, we propose key morphogenetic attributes of gullies necessary to form a framework for a systematic gully classification scheme. An initial, eclectic classification framework is presented as both a summation and a synthesis of the literature review, and as a progenitor to a dynamic generic classification scheme that is proposed in a follow-up article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-naturalness-index-for-the-identification-of-natural-areas-on-regional-scale&quot;&gt;The naturalness index for the identification of natural areas on regional scale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have been trying to measure the influence of humankind on our environment for several decades. Among the technical solutions for this goal, approaches for a rule-based fusion of different geospatial information layers have reached the greatest level of maturity, enabling the (semi-)automatic production of maps at resolutions of about 1 square kilometer. While those existing approaches aim at a global analysis of human influence, conservation efforts are usually implemented on a regional scale. To bridge the gap between a global, lowresolution analysis and a local, high-resolution analysis, with this paper, we propose the Naturalness Index (NI), which represents the naturalness of the Earth’s surface as a metric between 0 and 100 at a spatial resolution of 10 m per pixel. Our approach builds on the established Human Influence Index, but replaces different geospatial input layers with more recent, higher resolution counterparts. Using the cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine, regional maps at a resolution of 10 m x 10 m per pixel can be produced efficiently in a fully automatic manner. We demonstrate the functionality by creating maps for three different localities in Europe - Bavaria, Lapland, and Scotland. A comparison of the NI values achieved with our approach to official conservation areas as well as a correlation with existing similar maps indicate the validity of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Management Foundations for Navigating Ecological Transformation by Resisting, Accepting, or Directing Social-Ecological Change&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;management-foundations-for-navigating-ecological-transformation-by-resisting-accepting-or-directing-social-ecological-change&quot;&gt;Management Foundations for Navigating Ecological Transformation by Resisting, Accepting, or Directing Social-Ecological Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite striking global change, management to ensure healthy landscapes and sustained natural resources has tended to set objectives on the basis of the historical range of variability in stationary ecosystems. Many social-ecological systems are moving into novel conditions that can result in ecological transformation. We present four foundations to enable a transition to future-oriented conservation and management that increases capacity to manage change. The foundations are to identify plausible social-ecological trajectories, to apply upstream and deliberate engagement and decision-making with stakeholders, to formulate management pathways to desired futures, and to consider a portfolio approach to manage risk and account for multiple preferences across space and time. We use the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as a case study to illustrate how the four foundations address common land management challenges for navigating transformation and deciding when, where, and how to resist, accept, or direct social-ecological change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responding-to-ecological-transformation-mental-models-external-constraints-and-manager-decision-making&quot;&gt;Responding to Ecological Transformation: Mental Models, External Constraints, and Manager Decision-Making&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecological transformation creates many challenges for public natural resource management and requires managers to grapple with new relationships to change and new ways to manage it. In the context of unfamiliar trajectories of ecological change, a manager can resist, accept, or direct change, choices that make up the resist-accept-direct (RAD) framework. In this article, we provide a conceptual framework for how to think about this new decision space that managers must navigate. We identify internal factors (mental models) and external factors (social feasibility, institutional context, and scientific uncertainty) that shape management decisions. We then apply this conceptual framework to the RAD strategies (resist, accept, direct) to illuminate how internal and external factors shape those decisions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how this conceptual framework shapes our understanding of management decisions, especially how these decisions are not just ecological but also social, and the implications for research and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-salinity-a-global-threat-to-sustainable-development&quot;&gt;Soil salinity: A global threat to sustainable development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil is a vital resource for feeding the burgeoning global population, and it is also essential for realizing most of the ‘United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)’. For example, it is vital to realizing the ‘Zero hunger (SDG2), Good health and well-being (SDG3), Clean water and sanitation (SDG6), and Life on land (SDG15)’. Excess salts present in the soil make it saline, and it poses a significant threat to agricultural production and environmental health. Soil salinity is an extensive problem and spreads over one billion hectares extended over 100 countries. This paper presents a comprehensive review of global soil salinity management through the applications of remote sensing and GIS. All possible sources of relevant and current literature were accessed and more than 260 publications were collected and carefully analysed, for this review. The rationale and severity of the salinity problem are provided. The impact of salinity on plant yield and the effect of climate change on soil salinity are detailed. The salinity indicators and salinity monitoring and mapping are provided, and the global cases of soil salinity management through remote sensing and GIS applications under different agro-hydro-climatic environments are discussed, followed by a summary of conclusions and challenges along with future research directions. The analysis of past investigations showed that remote sensing strategy might be a practical approach to adequately assess plant response such as evapotranspiration under diverse salinity environments, yet it additionally has various difficulties. The lower spatial and temporal resolution of imagery may reason errors because of subpixel heterogeneity. However, with the improvement of the better-resolution thermal infrared remote method, there is the possibility to spot spatial variations at a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time in the practice of geotechnical engineering, soil has been viewed as an inert material, comprising only inorganic phases. However, microorganisms including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes are ubiquitous in soil and have the capacity and capability to alter bio-geochemical processes in the local soil environment. The cumulative changes could consequently modify the physical, mechanical, conductive and chemical properties of the bulk soil matrix. In recent years, the topic of bio-mediated geotechnics has gained momentum in the scientific literature. It involves the manipulation of various bio-geochemical soil processes to improve soil engineering performance. In particular, the process of microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) has received the most attention for its superior performance for soil improvement. The present work aims to shape a comprehensive understanding of recent developments in bio-mediated geotechnics, with a focus on MICP. Referring to around one hundred studies published over the past five years, this review focuses on popular and alternative MICP processes, innovative raw materials and additives for MICP, emerging tools and testing methodologies for characterizing MICP at multi-scale, and applications in emerging and/or unconventional geotechnical fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-miniaturized-method-for-fast-simple-and-sensitive-pesticide-analysis-in-soils&quot;&gt;A miniaturized method for fast, simple, and sensitive pesticide analysis in soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) like lindane and DDT have been used extensively after World War II until the 1990s. Still, residues of these pesticides can be found in agricultural soils all over the world, especially in developing countries. Often, they occur in extensive areas and elevated concentrations so that food safety is jeopardized. Hence, simple, cheap, and fast analytical methods are needed for a straight-forward assessment of risks. A miniaturized solid-liquid extraction combined with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) based on a proven ISO method is presented. Methods The performance of the method is evaluated by extracting three different soils which were spiked with HCH and DDT congeners, and trifluralin, and aged for 35 days. The results are compared with those of a modified quick, easy, cheap, efficient, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. For further validation, both methods are applied to three environmental soil samples. Results Validation results show limits of detection and quantification as well as recovery rates in good agreement with standard requirements. The new method was found to be quicker than QuEChERS, which requires time-consuming preparation of reagents. Conclusion Merits include low time and sample volume requirements (0.5 g) and the possibility to extract many samples simultaneously, which allows the screening of large sample sizes to determine the pollution status of whole landscape regions. However, access to an automated SPME apparatus is assumed. The authors can recommend this method as a cheap and fast alternative where SPME is available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Estimating cation exchange capacity from agronomic soil tests: Comparing Mehlich-3 and ammonium acetate sum of cations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-meaning-of-net-zero-and-how-to-get-it-right&quot;&gt;The meaning of net zero and how to get it right&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of net-zero carbon emissions has emerged from physical climate science. However, it is operationalized through social, political and economic systems. We identify seven attributes of net zero, which are important to make it a successful framework for climate action. The seven attributes highlight the urgency of emission reductions, which need to be front-loaded, and of coverage of all emission sources, including currently difficult ones. The attributes emphasize the need for social and environmental integrity. This means carbon dioxide removals should be used cautiously and the use of carbon offsets should be regulated effectively. Net zero must be aligned with broader sustainable development objectives, which implies an equitable net-zero transition, socio-ecological sustainability and the pursuit of broad economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net-zero emissions is more than a concept of physical climate science. It is implemented in social, political and economic contexts. This Perspective proposes seven attributes that are critical for the practical and effective implementation of net zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-cation-exchange-capacity-from-agronomic-soil-tests-comparing-mehlich-3-and-ammonium-acetate-sum-of-cations&quot;&gt;Estimating cation exchange capacity from agronomic soil tests: Comparing Mehlich-3 and ammonium acetate sum of cations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) measures the capability of soils to hold and release nutrients. It is an important measure for classifying soils and planning nutrient additions, but it is not included in routine soil tests offered to farmers. In this study, we compared CEC measured with standard laboratory practices (neutral ammonium acetate [AAc]) with CEC estimated from agronomic soil test data (Mehlich-3 and AAc). We applied previously published estimation methods to a dataset of 48 soil samples. Based on the results, traditional methods underestimate measured cation exchange capacity by 36% for Mehlich-3 and 24% for AAc. The estimation can be improved by including aluminium (12% overestimate) or by fitting a localized pedotransfer function (3% underestimate), which offers a possibility for informing land managers about their soil nutrient holding capacity without adding costs to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluation-of-mehlich-3-for-determination-of-cation-exchange-capacity-in-kansas-soils&quot;&gt;Evaluation of Mehlich-3 for determination of cation exchange capacity in Kansas soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil testing laboratories across the United States have implemented the Mehlich-3 (M3) extraction method for phosphorus (P) and other nutrients. Though M3 is known to work well as a multinutrient extractant, it raises concerns for measuring exchangeable cations, particularly in calcareous soils. The objectives of this study were (a) to evaluate M3 as an extractant for base cations for Kansas soils, (b) to identify a range of soil pH where M3 may be a suitable replacement for ammonium acetate (AA), and (c) to examine the relationship between cation exchange capacity (CEC) summation and CEC displacement. A study was conducted evaluating 308 soils collected from across Kansas and extracted using both the M3 and AA soil extraction methods. Cation exchange capacity was estimated using the summation approach from measurements of both the M3 and AA, and the displacement method. Results indicate a strong correlation among M3 and AA methods for K, Mg, and Na (R-2 = .98, .96, .97, respectively). However, these relationships were considerably weaker for extractable Ca (R-2 = .78), where extractable Ca was higher in the M3 extracts for high pH soils. Estimated CEC was also affected by soil pH for the M3 method, with an estimated critical pH value of 7.3. Extractable Ca and CEC for soils with a pH below 7.3 showed a strong correlation between M3 and AA methods (R-2 = .9). Using M3 as a multinutrient extractant can improve turnaround time for sample analysis in soil testing laboratories. However, the use of the M3 procedure in soils with a pH of 7.3 or above will likely result in overestimation of exchangeable Ca and CEC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-open-path-eddy-covariance-method-for-nitrous-oxide-and-other-trace-gases-that-minimizes-temperature-corrections&quot;&gt;A new open-path eddy covariance method for nitrous oxide and other trace gases that minimizes temperature corrections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-power, open-path gas sensors enable eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements in remote areas without line power. However, open-path flux measurements are sensitive to fluctuations in air temperature, pressure, and humidity. Laser-based, open-path sensors with the needed sensitivity for trace gases like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are impacted by additional spectroscopic effects. Corrections for these effects, especially those related to temperature fluctuations, often exceed the flux of gases, leading to large uncertainties in the associated fluxes. For example, the density and spectroscopic corrections arising from temperature fluctuations can be one or two orders of magnitude greater than background N2O fluxes. Consequently, measuring background fluxes with laser-based, open-path sensors is extremely challenging, particularly for N2O and gases with similar high-precision requirements. We demonstrate a new laser-based, open-path N2O sensor and a general approach applicable to other gases that minimizes temperature-related corrections for EC flux measurements. The method identifies absorption lines with spectroscopic effects in the opposite direction of density effects from temperature and, thus, density and spectroscopic effects nearly cancel one another. The new open-path N2O sensor was tested at a corn (Zea mays L.) field in Southwestern Michigan, United States. The sensor had an optimal precision of 0.1 ppbv at 10 Hz and power consumption of 50 W. Field trials showed that temperature-related corrections were 6% of density corrections, reducing EC random errors by 20-fold compared to previously examined lines. Measured open-path N2O EC fluxes showed excellent agreement with those made with static chambers (m = 1.0 +/- 0.3; r(2) = .96). More generally, we identified absorption lines for CO2 and CH4 flux measurements that can reduce the temperature-related corrections by 10-100 times compared to existing open-path sensors. The proposed method provides a new direction for future open-path sensors, facilitating the expansion of accurate EC flux measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-global-overview-of-studies-about-land-management-land-use-change-and-climate-change-effects-on-soil-organic-carbon&quot;&gt;A global overview of studies about land management, land-use change, and climate change effects on soil organic carbon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major drivers of gains or losses in soil organic carbon (SOC) include land management, land-use change, and climate change. Thousands of original studies have focused on these drivers of SOC change and are now compiled in a growing number of meta-analyses. To critically assess the research efforts in this domain, we retrieved and characterized 192 meta-analyses of SOC stocks or concentrations. These meta-analyses comprise more than 13,200 original studies conducted from 1910 to 2020 in 150 countries. First, we show that, despite a growing number of studies over time, the geographical coverage of studies is limited. For example, the effect of land management, land-use change, and climate change on SOC has been only occasionally studied in North and Central Africa, and in the Middle East and Central Asia. Second, the meta-analyses investigated a limited number of land management practices, mostly mineral fertilization, organic amendments, and tillage. Third, the meta-analyses demonstrated relatively low quality and transparency. Lastly, we discuss the mismatch between the increasing number of studies and the need for more local, reusable, and diversified knowledge on how to preserve high SOC stocks or restore depleted SOC stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-carbon-stocks-in-temperate-grasslands-differ-strongly-across-sites-but-are-insensitive-to-decade-long-fertilization&quot;&gt;Soil carbon stocks in temperate grasslands differ strongly across sites but are insensitive to decade-long fertilization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing soil carbon (C) storage has the potential to offset human-caused increases in atmospheric CO2. Rising CO2 has occurred concurrently with increasing supply rates of biologically limiting nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). However, it is unclear how increased supplies of N and P will alter soil C sequestration, particularly in grasslands, which make up nearly a third of non-agricultural land worldwide. Here, we leverage a globally distributed nutrient addition experiment (the Nutrient Network) to examine how a decade of N and P fertilization (alone and in combination) influenced soil C and N stocks at nine grassland sites spanning the continental United States. We measured changes in bulk soil C and N stocks and in three soil C fractions (light and heavy particulate organic matter, and mineral-associated organic matter fractions). Nutrient amendment had variable effects on soil C and N pools that ranged from strongly positive to strongly negative, while soil C and N pool sizes varied by more than an order of magnitude across sites. Piecewise SEM clarified that small increases in plant C inputs with fertilization did not translate to greater soil C storage. Nevertheless, peak season aboveground plant biomass (but not root biomass or production) was strongly positively related to soil C storage at seven of the nine sites, and across all nine sites, soil C covaried with moisture index and soil mineralogy, regardless of fertilization. Overall, we show that site factors such as moisture index, plant productivity, soil texture, and mineralogy were key predictors of cross-site soil C, while nutrient amendment had weaker and site-specific effects on C sequestration. This suggests that prioritizing the protection of highly productive temperate grasslands is critical for reducing future greenhouse gas losses arising from land use change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-we-learn-from-the-water-retention-characteristic-of-a-soil-regarding-its-hydrological-and-agricultural-functions-review-and-analysis-of-actual-knowledge&quot;&gt;What Can We Learn From the Water Retention Characteristic of a Soil Regarding Its Hydrological and Agricultural Functions? Review and Analysis of Actual Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soil properties of the upper soil layer determine the partitioning between infiltration, runoff, and evaporation, key processes related to soil agricultural and hydrological functioning. It is therefore important to have some information on these soil functions based on available and easy-to-measure properties. This study presents what we can learn a-priori from the soil water retention characteristic (WRC) on some important hydrological and agricultural functions. Based on a mathematical expression of the soil WRC, it is possible to estimate: the characteristic length, L-C, related to the disruption of hydraulic continuity of the water liquid phase in the soil; the saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s; the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function of water and air, K(theta(w)) and K(theta(a)); the saturation degree S-eFC at field capacity and how long it will take to reach that state; the available water content in the soil, AWC; the capillary head at the wetting front, psi(f); the infiltration capacity curve based on the Green and Ampt model, q(cap)(t); the time to ponding, t(p), for any prescribed wetting rate; the cumulative water loss during stage-1 evaporation; the duration of stage-1 evaporation. All these a-priori estimates are valuable and sometimes necessary for efficient design and planning in agricultural and hydrological applications. The values of these estimates depend upon the specific mathematical expression chosen to represent the WRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-bulk-density-fractions-explain-heterogeneity-in-global-soil-carbon-abundance-and-persistence&quot;&gt;Beyond bulk: Density fractions explain heterogeneity in global soil carbon abundance and persistence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the controls on the amount and persistence of soil organic carbon (C) is essential for predicting its sensitivity to global change. The response may depend on whether C is unprotected, isolated within aggregates, or protected from decomposition by mineral associations. Here, we present a global synthesis of the relative influence of environmental factors on soil organic C partitioning among pools, abundance in each pool (mg C g(-1) soil), and persistence (as approximated by radiocarbon abundance) in relatively unprotected particulate and protected mineral-bound pools. We show that C within particulate and mineral-associated pools consistently differed from one another in degree of persistence and relationship to environmental factors. Soil depth was the best predictor of C abundance and persistence, though it accounted for more variance in persistence. Persistence of all C pools decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) throughout the soil profile, whereas persistence increased with increasing wetness index (MAP/PET) in subsurface soils (30-176 cm). The relationship of C abundance (mg C g(-1) soil) to climate varied among pools and with depth. Mineral-associated C in surface soils (&amp;lt;30 cm) increased more strongly with increasing wetness index than the free particulate C, but both pools showed attenuated responses to the wetness index at depth. Overall, these relationships suggest a strong influence of climate on soil C properties, and a potential loss of soil C from protected pools in areas with decreasing wetness. Relative persistence and abundance of C pools varied significantly among land cover types and soil parent material lithologies. This variability in each pool’s relationship to environmental factors suggests that not all soil organic C is equally vulnerable to global change. Therefore, projections of future soil organic C based on patterns and responses of bulk soil organic C may be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-variation-in-soil-carbon-sequestration-potential-through-improved-cropland-management&quot;&gt;Global variation in soil carbon sequestration potential through improved cropland management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widespread adoption of improved cropland management measures is advocated to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thereby improving soil fertility and mitigating climate change. However, spatially explicit insight on management impacts is limited, which is crucial for region-specific and climate-smart practices. To overcome these limitations, we combined global meta-analytical results on improved management practices on SOC sequestration with spatially explicit data on current management practices and potential areas for the adoption of these measures. We included (a) fertilization practices, i.e., use of organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer or no fertilizer, (b) soil tillage practices, i.e., no-tillage relative to high or intermediate intensity tillage, and (c) crop management practices, i.e., use of cover crops and enhanced crop residue incorporation. We show that the estimated global C sequestration potential varies between 0.44 and 0.68 Gt C yr(-1), assuming maximum complementarity among all measures taken. A more realistic estimate, not assuming maximum complementarity, is from 0.28 to 0.43 Gt C yr(-1), being on the lower end of the current range of 0.1-2 Gt C yr(-1) found in the literature. One reason for the lower estimate is the limited availability of manure that has not yet been recycled. Another reason is the limited area for the adoption of improved measures, considering their current application and application limitations. We found large regional differences in carbon sequestration potential due to differences in yield gaps, SOC levels, and current practices applied. The highest potential is found in regions with low crop production, low initial SOC levels, and in regions where livestock manure and crop residues are only partially recycled. Supporting previous findings, we highlight that to encourage both soil fertility and SOC sequestration, it is best to focus on agricultural soils with large yield gaps and/or where SOC values are below levels that may limit crop production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mechanisms-of-soil-organic-carbon-stability-and-its-response-to-no-till-a-global-synthesis-and-perspective&quot;&gt;Mechanisms of soil organic carbon stability and its response to no-till: A global synthesis and perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization have been widely studied due to their relevance in the global carbon cycle. No-till (NT) has been frequently adopted to sequester SOC; however, limited information is available regarding whether sequestered SOC will be stabilized for long term. Thus, we reviewed the mechanisms affecting SOC stability in NT systems, including the priming effects (PE), molecular structure of SOC, aggregate protection, association with soil minerals, microbial properties, and environmental effects. Although a more steady-state molecular structure of SOC is observed in NT compared with conventional tillage (CT), SOC stability may depend more on physical and chemical protection. On average, NT improves macro-aggregation by 32.7%, and lowers SOC mineralization in macro-aggregates compared with CT. Chemical protection is also important due to the direct adsorption of organic molecules and the enhancement of aggregation by soil minerals. Higher microbial activity in NT could also produce binding agents to promote aggregation and the formation of metal-oxidant organic complexes. Thus, microbial residues could be stabilized in soils over the long term through their attachment to mineral surfaces and entrapment of aggregates under NT. On average, NT reduces SOC mineralization by 18.8% and PE intensities after fresh carbon inputs by 21.0% compared with CT (p &amp;lt; .05). Although higher temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) is observed in NT due to greater Q(10) in macro-aggregates, an increase of soil moisture regime in NT could potentially constrain the improvement of Q(10). This review improves process-based understanding of the physical and chemical mechanism of protection that can act, independently or interactively, to enhance SOC preservation. It is concluded that SOC sequestered in NT systems is likely to be stabilized over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-use intensification can reduce soil carbon stocks and changes microbial community biodiversity and functionality. However, there is a lack of consensus on whether management consistently affects microbial biodiversity across geographic scales, and how this relates to altered soil function. From a regulatory and monitoring perspective, there is a need to identify functionally relevant indicators of land use in order to evaluate the progress of soil restoration approaches. We performed a landscape-scale survey of unimproved calcareous grasslands paired with local arable contrasts, and assessed the consistency of responses in a variety of soil, biotic and functional measures. In addition, adjacent grasslands undergoing restoration were assessed to identify soil microbial indicators of recovery. Organic matter content was consistently larger in grasslands than in arable fields, and increased with time in the restoring sites. Molecular comparisons of grassland versus arable soils revealed numerous bacterial, archaeal and fungal indicators, with more representatives of Ca. Xiphinematobacter, DA101, Bradyrhizobium, Rhodoplanes, Mycobacteria and Mortierella in old grassland soils, whereas Nitrososphaera, Sporosarcina and Alternaria infectoria were more abundant in arable soils. Extracellular enzymatic responses were more variable, with none of the eight investigated enzymes being consistent indicators of grassland or arable soils. Correlation analyses, incorporating the molecular and enzymatic responses across all surveyed soils, revealed that molecular indicators were more strongly correlated with soil organic matter increases with restoration of arable soils. Our results highlight that microbial taxa are among the most sensitive indicators of soil restoration, and we identify consistent responses of specific taxa to management across geographic scales. This discovery will be important for both the instigation and monitoring of soil restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil microbes are key drivers of soil ecosystem services and are affected by management&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calcareous grassland exhibited abundant Verrucomicrobia; cropping increased Nitrososphaera&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These taxa responded to SOM increases with grassland restoration, more so than enzymes and fungi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microbes provide consistent, site-independent indicators for calcareous grassland soil function restoration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-health-cluster-analysis-based-on-national-monitoring-of-soil-indicators&quot;&gt;Soil health cluster analysis based on national monitoring of soil indicators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in soil science is to monitor and understand the state and change of soils at a national scale to inform decision making and policy. To address this, there is a need to identify key parameters for soil health and function and determine how they relate to other parameters, including traditional soil surveys. Here we present a national-scale dataset of topsoil sampled as part of a wider agri-environment monitoring scheme in Wales, UK. Over 1,350 topsoils (0-15 cm) were sampled across a very wide range of habitats and a range of physical, chemical and biological soil quality indicators were measured. We show consistent differences in soil physicochemical properties across habitat types, with carbon decreasing and pH increasing across the habitat productivity gradient from bogs through woodlands and grasslands to arable systems. The soils within our dataset are largely within the limits identified as important for supporting habitat function, with the exception of excessive phosphate levels in mesotrophic grassland. Cluster detection methods identified four soil functional classes based on measured topsoil properties, which were more related to habitat type than the genesis-based soil classification from soil maps. These soil functional classes can be interpreted as phenoforms within the soil genoforms found by traditional soil classification. This shows the importance of land-use management in determining the soil health and functional capacity of soils. Our work provides an account of the current state of soil health in Wales, its relationship to soil function and a baseline for future monitoring to track changes against agri-environment and other policy targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-good-level-of-soil-organic-matter-an-index-based-on-organic-carbon-to-clay-ratio&quot;&gt;What is a good level of soil organic matter? An index based on organic carbon to clay ratio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple measures of appropriate levels of soil organic matter are needed for soil evaluation, management and monitoring, based on readily measurable soil properties. We test an index of soil organic matter based on the soil organic carbon (SOC) to clay ratio, defined by thresholds of SOC/clay ratio for specified levels of soil structural quality. The thresholds were originally delineated for a small number of Swiss soils. We assess the index using data from the initial sampling (1978-83) of the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales, covering 3,809 sites under arable land, grassland and woodland. Land use, soil type, annual precipitation and soil pH together explained 21% of the variance in SOC/clay ratio in the dataset, with land use the most important variable. Thresholds of SOC/clay ratio of 1/8, 1/10 and 1/13 indicated the boundaries between “very good”, “good”, “moderate” and “degraded” levels of structural condition. On this scale, 38.2, 6.6 and 5.6% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded. The index gives a method to assess and monitor soil organic matter at national, regional or sub-regional scales based on two routinely measured soil properties. Given the wide range of soils and land uses across England and Wales in the dataset used to test the index, we suggest it should apply to other European soils in similar climate zones. Highlights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assess the use of SOC/clay ratios as guidelines for soil management in England and Wales. We use data from 3,809 sites to assess thresholds based on work for Polish, French and Swiss soils. SOC/clay threshold values can indicate degraded and good soil structural condition. The thresholds show the effect of land use and provide an index for use in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biochar-in-climate-change-mitigation&quot;&gt;Biochar in climate change mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change mitigation strategies based on biochar generation-and its application to agricultural soils-can effectively sequester carbon, although biogeochemical and economic trade-offs must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change mitigation not only requires reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, but also withdrawal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Here we review the relationship between emissions reductions and CO2 removal by biochar systems, which are based on pyrolysing biomass to produce biochar, used for soil application, and renewable bioenergy. Half of the emission reductions and the majority of CO2 removal result from the one to two orders of magnitude longer persistence of biochar than the biomass it is made from. Globally, biochar systems could deliver emission reductions of 3.4-6.3 PgCO(2)e, half of which constitutes CO2 removal. Relevant trade-offs exist between making and sequestering biochar in soil or producing more energy. Importantly, these trade-offs depend on what type of energy is replaced: relative to producing bioenergy, emissions of biochar systems increase by 3% when biochar replaces coal, whereas emissions decrease by 95% when biochar replaces renewable energy. The lack of a clear relationship between crop yield increases in response to fertilizer and to biochar additions suggests opportunities for biochar to increase crop yields where fertilizer alone is not effective, but also questions blanket recommendations based on known fertilizer responses. Locally specific decision support must recognize these relationships and trade-offs to establish carbon-trading mechanisms that facilitate a judicious implementation commensurate with climate change mitigation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-trust-substitution-technologies-to-support-smallholder-livelihoods-in-sub-saharan-africa&quot;&gt;Digital trust substitution technologies to support smallholder livelihoods in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology has the potential to reduce the need for trust and to ensure accountability and equity in smallholder agricultural development. We present two applications - one already in progress and one hypothetical - using blockchain to address market failures in the smallholder sector in Sub-Saharan Africa. First, we explore BanQu, a blockchain-based platform used by Anheuser-Busch InBev to create verified financial identities for smallholders along the supply chain. Second, we discuss a hypothetical blockchain application to improve the reliability of actors within smallholder dairy cooperatives. Blockchain applications in smallholder agriculture could be transformative, serving as substitutes for trust, but alone blockchain is not a solution to the multiple challenges facing the smallholder farming sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;humic-substances-hypotheses-and-reality-a-review&quot;&gt;Humic Substances: Hypotheses and Reality (a Review)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term humic substances (HS) refers to a group of heterogeneous, dark-colored polydisperse substances found in soils, peats, natural waters, and sediments. It is hypothesized that HSs are formed as a result of degradation and transformation of biomolecules of organic residues and free radical condensation reactions (a process called humification). Humic substances are classified as a special category of natural compounds that are dissimilar to the biomolecules of plant and microbial tissues, and are resistant to biodegradation. On the basis of their solubility in alkalis, HSs are divided into humic acids (HAs, soluble, precipitated at pH &amp;lt; 2), fulvic acids (FAs, soluble at all pH values), and humin (insoluble residue). The review provides a critical analysis of the HS terminology and nomenclature, the method of extraction of HS from natural objects, and the hypotheses describing their formation. The ambiguity and duality of the concept of HSs (specific compounds and the sum of operational fractions) are demonstrated, as well as an arbitrary character of the division of organic matter (OM) into the dark-colored compounds of poorly defined structure (HSs) and the substances with a known structure (non-HSs). The interpretation of HSs as mass products of a secondary synthesis requires revision. The possibility of extracellular free radical reactions in soils leaves no doubt; however, a quantitative contribution of the corresponding products to the natural OM has not been established yet. The traditional alkaline extraction should be considered as a method for isolation of hydrophilic polar substances, while the precipitation with acid as their concentration for further analysis. The historical names of humic fractions (HAs, FAs, and humin) should be retained as well-established generic terms and names of the preparations obtained in a certain way without attaching unique features and specificity to all components of these fractions. The C-HA/C-FA (or C-HA/C-org) ratios are simple and convenient indicators of the types of humus reflecting bioclimatic conditions of its formation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The Four Ways to Consider Measurement Noise in Bayesian Model Selection-And Which One to Choose&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-quality-and-grain-yield-a-win-win-combination-in-clayey-tropical-oxisols&quot;&gt;Soil quality and grain yield: A win-win combination in clayey tropical oxisols&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationships between a soil quality index (SQI(FERTBIO)) and soil functions with both relative cumulative grain yields (RCY) and soil organic carbon (SOC), were evaluated in a tropical clayey Cerrado Oxisol. Soil quality (SQ) was quantified integrating chemical (FERT) and biological (BIO) indicators in a weighted-additive soil quality index combining three soil functions and respective indicators: (F1) nutrient cycling (based on the activities of soil enzymes beta-glucosidase and arylsulfatase), (F2) nutrient storage (SOC and cation exchange capacity, CEC) and (F3) nutrient supply (Ca+2, Mg+2, K+, P, pH, H + Al; Al+3, sum of bases (SB) and base saturation (%BS)). The contribution of each indicator for the related soil function was scored using standardized scoring functions (SSF) that transform the indicator value on a scale between 0 and 1. Soil samples (0 to 10 cm depth) were collected in 2013 and 2015 from 21 treatments from three long-term field experiments, with different P fertilizer management strategies. P-fertilization resulted in higher cumulative crop yields that in turn were associated with better SQI(FERTBIO) and soil functions scores. Through linear regression analyses, critical limits (CLs) to interpret the individual scores of the SQI and of the soil functions, based on RCY and SOC were defined. The proposed SQI was positively associated with RCY (p &amp;lt; 0,001; R-2 = 0,95) and SOC (p &amp;lt; 0,001; R-2 = 0,88). Similar significant relationships were found between the three soil functions and RCY or SOC. Overall, the lower and upper limits of the interpretative classes for the SQI(FERTBIO) and soil functions scores (where the index scores are equivalent, respectively, to 40% and 80% of the optimal RCY or SOC) were 0.42 and 0.64. The combination of chemical and biological indicators in different soil functions and in the SQI(FERTBIO) proved to be a simple and useful strategy to assess SQ in tropical Oxisols, linking agronomic management practices to both SQ, yield benefits and SOC. These results will help extensionists, agronomists and soil scientists, when assisting farmers, in soil health assessments, by making easier to explain the importance of SQ for the economic performance of farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protect-manage-and-then-restore-lands-for-climate-mitigation&quot;&gt;Protect, manage and then restore lands for climate mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural climate solutions, along with reduction in fossil fuel emissions, are critical to mitigating climate change and meeting climate goals. This Perspective outlines a hierarchy for decision-making regarding protecting, managing and then restoring natural systems for climate mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited time and resources remain to constrain the climate crisis. Natural climate solutions represent promising options to protect, manage and restore natural lands for additional climate mitigation, but they differ in (1) the magnitude and (2) immediacy of mitigation potential, as well as (3) cost-effectiveness and (4) the co-benefits they offer. Counter to an emerging preference for restoration, we use these four criteria to propose a general rule of thumb to protect, manage and then restore lands, but also show how these criteria explain alternative prioritization and portfolio schemes. This hierarchy offers a decision-making framework for public and private sector actors to optimize the effectiveness of natural climate solutions in an environment in which resources are constrained, and time is short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-rock-fragments-unquantified-players-in-terrestrial-carbon-and-nitrogen-cycles&quot;&gt;Soil rock fragments: Unquantified players in terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils with a significant proportion of rock fragments (RFs, with diameter &amp;gt;2 mm) are widely distributed in terrestrial ecosystems. However, a lack of quantitative information about RF characteristics restricts our ability to explain and predict the related soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) processes, and induces biases of C and N investigations in areas where soils contain significant RFs. In this paper, we reviewed the direct and indirect effects of RFs on soil C and N cycles, including via affecting soil C and N stocks, hydrology, temperature, and via chemical weathering that releases C, N, cations and anions, consumes CO2 and regulates pH. Based on this, we discussed current challenges and potential solutions in investigating C and N cycles of high RF content soils. First, we proposed a series of approaches to quantifying the effects of RFs on C and N stocks and soil hydrology across scales. Second, we emphasized the evolutions of soil RFs’ properties over time, and recommended including RF physicochemical properties in the routine soil inventory. Third, we suggested that both the effects of RFs and the evolutions of soil RFs over time should be considered in model simulation. Finally, we provided a framework by coupling monitoring, mapping and modelling to investigate the roles of RFs on soil C and N cycles from earth’s critical zone to global scale. This review will improve our understandings of RFs and terrestrial C and N cycles, and their responses to global change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distribution-of-soil-organic-matter-fractions-are-altered-with-soil-priming&quot;&gt;Distribution of soil organic matter fractions are altered with soil priming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a central role in mediating soil productivity through its impacts on nutrient cycling and retention, aggregate stability and water retention. Thus, management techniques or technologies including novel soil amendments could benefit farmers through the accumulation of carbon (C) and other nutrients in SOM. However, these same inputs can also lead to accelerated mineralization of native SOM through the process known as priming. This unresolved paradox may be due to the limited understanding of how different SOM fractions respond to priming and in which direction. In this study, we examine the response of functionally distinct SOM fractions to priming when soils are amended with lactobionate, a low molecular weight sugar acid byproduct of cheese manufacturing. Liquid-based 13C lactobionate was added to an agricultural silty loam soil to study its persistence, priming effects, and response of different SOM fractions to lactobionate over 84 days. Cumulative soil carbon dioxide (CO2) was greater in lactobionate-amended soils versus control and by the end of the experiment, 53% of added lactobionate was mineralized. In total, positive priming of 40% of extant SOM was observed from 14 to 84 days. Lactobionate-induced changes to SOM fractions were determined at days 14, 28, 56 and 84 of the incubation to examine if and how priming altered the distribution of C between fast and slowcycling SOC fractions. In response to lactobionate, the total C content of the water extractable organic matter (WEOM) fraction initially increased by 100% from the dissolved lactobionate we added, but then declined and at a faster rate than other SOM fractions. In addition, the total C of the light-fraction particulate organic matter (LFPOM) fraction also declined. At the same time, we observed total C increases in the slower-cycling sand-sized POM (H-POM) and mineral-associated organic (MAOM) C fractions, in response to lactobionate additions. We also saw a marginal increase in total soil C in the lactobionate-amended soils. Our findings therefore suggest that the application of lactobionate to soils may induce positive priming of the faster cycling LF-POM and WEOM fractions, but also concurrent gains in the H-POM and MAOM C fractions associated with long-term persistence and relative resiliency to disturbance with no net loss of total soil carbon. Thus, the application of low-molecular weight C-based materials such as lactobionate presents an avenue to building more persistent SOM through its impacts on the internal cycling and transformation of SOM fractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responses-of-soil-ph-to-no-till-and-the-factors-affecting-it-a-global-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;Responses of soil pH to no-till and the factors affecting it: A global meta-analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-till (NT) is a sustainable option because of its benefits in controlling erosion, saving labor, and mitigating climate change. However, a comprehensive assessment of soil pH response to NT is still lacking. Thus, a global meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effects of NT on soil pH and to identify the influential factors and possible consequences based on the analysis of 114 publications. When comparing tillage practices, the results indicated an overall significant decrease by 1.33 +/- 0.28% in soil pH under NT than that under conventional tillage (p &amp;lt; .05). Soil texture, NT duration, mean annual temperature (MAT), and initial soil pH are the critical factors affecting soil pH under NT. Specifically, with significant variations among subgroups, when compared to conventional tillage, the soil under NT had lower relative changes in soil pH observed on clay loam soil (-2.44%), long-term implementation (-2.11% for more than 15 years), medium MAT (-1.87% in the range of 8-16celcius), neutral soil pH (-2.28% for 6.5 &amp;lt; initial soil pH &amp;lt; 7.5), mean annual precipitation (-1.95% in the range of 600-1200 mm), in topsoil layers (-2.03% for 0-20 cm), with crop rotation (-1.98%), N fertilizer input (the same for NT and conventional tillage) of 100-200 kg N ha(-1) (-1.83%), or crop residue retention (-1.52%). Changes in organic matter decomposition under undisturbed soil and with crop residue retention might lead to a higher concentration of H+ and lower of basic cations (i.e., calcium, magnesium, and potassium), which decrease the soil pH, and consequently, impact nutrient dynamics (i.e., soil phosphorus) in the surface layer under NT. Furthermore, soil acidification may be aggravated by NT within site-specific conditions and improper fertilizer and crop residue management and consequently leading to adverse effects on soil nutrient availability. Thus, there is a need to identify strategies to ameliorate soil acidification under NT to minimize the adverse consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spatial-temporal-characteristics-of-ecosystem-health-in-central-asia&quot;&gt;Spatial-temporal characteristics of ecosystem health in Central Asia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-use/land-cover change in Central Asia has led to ecological disasters such as draining of the Aral Sea, salinization, desertification that ultimately affect the ecosystem’s health. However, only a few studies have systematically assessed the spatial-temporal characteristics of ecosystem health in Central Asia using an integrated ecosystem assessment method. Therefore, this study aims to assess the ecosystem health of Central Asia using multi-source high-resolution data as the indicator and the integrated ecosystem vigor-ecosystem organization-ecosystem elasticity (V-O-E) model. The result showed that most of the areas in Central Asia are in a weak state of ecosystem vigor, ecosystem organization, ecosystem elasticity, and ecosystem health. The fragile state of the ecosystem health was highly due to the decreasing density of forest land, farmland, waterbody, and the increasing density of bare land and artificial land. The area of farmland gradually decreased, from 878639.08 km(2) in 2000 to 719128.08 km(2) in 2010 and 584251.36 km(2) in 2017. The forest of Central Asia has been declining continuously from 161998.69 km(2) in 2000 to 115343.96 km(2) in 2010 to 81185.10 km(2) in 2017 and has become spatially heterogeneous. Interestingly, the area of forest land in Xinjiang increased from 18216.14 km(2) in 2000 to 20970.92 km(2) in 2010 and 23098.12 km(2) in 2017, although there was a decrease in the overall forest land in other countries of Central Asia; this shows that China’s afforestation and reforestation policies during the last two decades had notable contributions to the ecosystem vigor and ecosystem elasticity in Xinjiang, which led to the increase in ecosystem health in Xinjiang. Hence, it is urgent to initiate integrated water management measures, limit the population growth and take adequate measures to enhance the techniques of farmland development to enhance the ecosystem health of Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-four-ways-to-consider-measurement-noise-in-bayesian-model-selection-and-which-one-to-choose&quot;&gt;The Four Ways to Consider Measurement Noise in Bayesian Model Selection-And Which One to Choose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a statistically rigorous approach to assess the plausibility of competing models. It naturally accounts for uncertainties in models and data. In this study, we discuss the role of measurement noise in BMS deeper than in past literature. We distinguish between four cases, accounting for noise in models and/or data: (1) no-no, (2) no-yes, (3) yes-no, and (4) yes-yes. These cases differ mathematically and philosophically. Only two out of these four cases are logically consistent, and they represent two potentially conflicting research questions: “Which model is best in modeling the pure physics?” (Case 1) and “which model is best in predicting the data-generating process (i.e., physics plus noise)?” (Case 4). If we are interested in the “pure physics question,” we face two practical challenges: First, we would need noise-free data, which is impossible to obtain; and second, the numerical approximation of Bayesian model evidence can be hard when neglecting noise. We discuss how to address both challenges and reveal that a fallback to the easier “data-generation question” as a proxy for the “physics question” is not appropriate. We demonstrate on synthetic scenarios and a real-world hydrogeological case study that the choice of the case has a significant impact on the outcome of posterior model weights, and hence on results of the model ranking, model selection, model averaging, model confusion analysis, and uncertainty quantification. Reality might force us to use a different case than philosophy would suggest, and we provide guidance on how to interpret model probabilities under such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-hybrid-method-for-characterizing-tillage-induced-soil-physical-quality-at-the-profile-scale-with-fine-spatial-details&quot;&gt;A hybrid method for characterizing tillage-induced soil physical quality at the profile scale with fine spatial details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robust methods are needed to assess tillage-induced changes in the physical quality of agricultural soils. Most soil physical quality (SPQ) evaluation procedures are based on the analysis of a limited number of soil cores randomly sampled in the soil profile. Such procedures likely fail to properly capture the spatial patterns in soil structure induced by tillage implements and vehicle traffic, resulting in a misleading SPQ diagnosis. We propose a hybrid method that couples high-resolution soil penetration resistance measurements with soil core sampling to derive high-resolution data grids of SPQ indicators encompassing the soil profile structural heterogeneity. The method builds on strong experimental relationships between soil penetration resistance and bulk density, and between bulk density and the soil hydraulic properties. We tested our method on a silt-loam soil with three tillage treatments (moldboard plowing, deep loosening with a tine cultivator, and minimum tillage), each including a zone impacted by the wheel traffic. The results allow visualization and analysissis of of the effect of tillage treatments and vehicle traffic on the soil SPQ indicators with a high level of spatial detail. The proposed methodology can be used to compare various soil management techniques or to monitor the temporal evolution of SPQ. As such, it can be a valuable tool to guide agricultural soil management. Furthermore, the generated high-resolution soil physical parameter grids could be used to parameterize numerical hydrodynamic models and estimate water and solute fluxes with distributed parameters representing the actual soil profile heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-soil-moisture-based-framework-for-guiding-the-number-and-location-of-soil-moisture-sensors-in-agricultural-fields&quot;&gt;A soil moisture-based framework for guiding the number and location of soil moisture sensors in agricultural fields&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil moisture information is a key variable for guiding in-season management decisions in rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems. However, methods for deciding the number and location of soil moisture sensors (SMS) per field still remain poorly explored in the scientific literature. The goal of this study was to evaluate a quantitative framework based on soil moisture-based management zones (MZs) to determine the minimum number and tentative deployment location of SMS. Multiple spatially intensive (n &amp;gt; 100 observations) surveys of near-surface (0-12 cm) soil moisture were conducted during the fallow periods and early growing seasons of 2017, 2018, and 2019 on three agricultural fields using a calibrated handheld soil water reflectometer. The fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method was used to delineate MZs based on the soil moisture surveys, and the silhouette clustering evaluation method was used to identify the optimal number of MZs per field. Then, a sensor location index that considered the distance to the MZ boundaries and the FCM membership grade was developed to identify the tentative optimal deployment location of SMS. The proposed method effectively identified field areas with distinct soil moisture regimes and revealed the complex soil moisture spatial patterns that were not captured with elevation or soil texture alone. Dividing the fields using soil moisture-based MZ reduced the intrazone soil moisture spatial variability by about 50% compared with that of the entire field. In the three studied fields, a total of two SMS were sufficient to capture the salient soil moisture spatial regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unreconciled-effects-of-salinity-on-draining-and-wetting-functions-in-unsaturated-soils&quot;&gt;Unreconciled effects of salinity on draining and wetting functions in unsaturated soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sequence of one-step outflow-inflow experiments, this study examines the effects of salinity on soil hydraulic properties with the goal of developing a better understanding of how to predict salinity’s impacts on soils. The results of this study are compared with estimates obtained using the Hydrus-1D model for soil water and solute transport. The model assumes a decline in hydraulic conductivity (K), caused by solution chemistry, is constant over the entire hydraulic conductivity function [K(theta)] and equal to a constant reduction factor established at saturation. In contrast with the model assumptions, the results of this study show an increase in the solution chemistry’s effect on K with decreasing soil moisture (theta). These findings demonstrate that current models that exclude solution chemistry, or models that assume a constant K reduction for the entire K(theta) function, may be overestimating drainage, recharge, or bare soil evaporation. This research used undisturbed soil cores and simulated irrigation water with decreasing electrical conductivity (EC) from 20 to 0.25 dS m(-1) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) held constant. Changes in K(theta) were observed only after dropping below an EC of 1.5 dS m(-1), which is consistent with past studies. At reduced soil water contents, however, K(theta) decreased by up to five orders of magnitude relative to native soils. A second experiment was conducted that increased the SAR from 4 to &amp;gt;= 20, held EC constant at 0.65 dS m(-1), and displayed only moderate reductions in K(theta), although K was reduced proportionally more at reduced soil water contents. Therefore, based on the observed results, an integrated K(EC,theta) and K(SAR,theta) model is needed to better predict salinity effects on soil hydraulic properties and is increasingly important as freshwater resources decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empirical-assessment-of-the-relation-between-ecological-connectivity-and-land-complexity-based-on-information-theoretic-metrics&quot;&gt;Empirical assessment of the relation between ecological connectivity and land complexity based on information-theoretic metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habitat fragmentation and connectivity loss pose significant threats to biodiversity at both local and landscape levels. Strategies to increase ecological connectivity and preserve strong connectivity are important for dealing with the potential threat of habitat degradation. Various metrics have been used to measure (i.e., quantify) landscape composition and configuration in landscape ecology. However, their relationship with ecological connectivity must be understood to interpret landscape patterns comprehensively. In the present study, correlations between ecological connectivity and land complexity are examined based on information-theory metrics. Two primary questions are explored: (1) to what extent are landscape mosaic measures of entropy correlated with ecological connectivity, with landscape gradient-based measures, and with each other? (2) are landscape gradient-based entropy measures correlated with ecological connectivity more than discrete entropy measures? Results show that all information theoretic metrics are statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) for modelling ecological connectivity. Among categorically-based indices, the relationship between ECI and joint entropy was the most significant, while a generalized additive model indicated that Boltzmann entropy could predict the ecological connectivity index, explaining similar to 60% of the variance. Therefore, configurational entropy can be used for improving ecological connectivity models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enacting-theories-of-change-for-food-systems-transformation-under-climate-change&quot;&gt;Enacting theories of change for food systems transformation under climate change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, we have seen growing calls for a transformation in global food systems in response to multiple challenges, including climate change. Food systems are responsible for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activity and agricultural yields are at risk due to climate change impacts. Although many proposals have been made, there are fewer insights on what these imply for knowledge and innovation systems. We seek to advance the literature on transforming food systems under a changing climate, by identifying concrete next steps for scientists and practitioners. We do this by adapting a theory of change proposed by Campbell et al. (2018). We used the adapted theory of change to design the 5th Global Science Conference on ClimateSmart Agriculture, which brought together different stakeholders within global food systems. Through conference sessions and a survey with 262 of the participants, we validate elements of the Campbell et al. framework, identify additional elements, and offer further nuance. The findings point at nine priority areas for a transformation in food systems under climate change: (1) Empowering farmer and consumer organizations, women and youth; (2) Digitally enabled climate-informed services; (3) Climate-resilient and low-emission practices and technologies; (4) Innovative finance to leverage public and private sector investments; (5) Reshaping supply chains, food retail, marketing and procurement; (6) Fostering enabling policies and institutions; (7) Knowledge transfer; (8) Addressing fragmentation in the knowledge and innovation systems; (9) Ensuring food security. We have identified three types of scholarly insights from innovation, transition and sustainability transformations studies that may inform the next steps: these relate to stimulating novelty across the priority areas, ensuring participation in knowledge production, and reconfiguring incumbent systems to enable implementation of the theory of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-properties-sensitive-to-degradation-caused-by-increasing-intensity-of-conventional-tillage&quot;&gt;Soil properties sensitive to degradation caused by increasing intensity of conventional tillage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased conventional tillage intensity causes soil degradation in agrosystems. In this field experiment, we evaluate the sensitivity of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties under varying soil tillage intensities. The treatments were: TI0 (tillage intensity zero); TI2 (tillage intensity two); TI4 (tillage intensity four); TI6 (tillage intensity six); and TI8 (tillage intensity eight). These treatments corresponded to two tillage seasons (dry and rainy conditions) with four tillage intensities of conventional tillage (ploughing + harrowing) performed monthly. The restorative role of crop growth and rotations in soil properties was not considered in this study, and the interval between soil tillage was short. After the second tillage season, we determined 31 soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Biological properties were more affected by conventional tillage intensity than physical and chemical properties. The most sensitive soil properties to the increasing tillage intensities were aggregate weighted mean diameter (WMD), percentage of aggregates (PA), bulk density (Bd), total porosity (TP), macroporosity (Mac), microporosity (Mic), soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic matter (SOM), total microbial activity (FDA), arylsulfatase (Ary), acid phosphatase (Phos), and xylanase activity (Xyl). A minimum data set including WMD, Mac, SOM, and Xyl was suggested. The highest intensity of conventional tillage reduced WMD, Xyl and Mac by 28%, 51%, and 63%, respectively, and increased SOM by 14% relative to the control. This work may guide managers on the best soil properties for monitoring the impacts of soil tillage on soil quality in agricultural areas that routinely use conventional tillage as a management practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;influence-of-cropping-system-and-soil-type-on-soil-health&quot;&gt;Influence of cropping system and soil type on soil health&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a continued adaption and application of soil health tests across all regions of the globe; however, there are challenges related to the interpretation of the results of soil health tests developed in one region but applied elsewhere. To determine the factors that are the most important for interpreting soil health tests in Nova Scotia, a soil health database was constructed using soil samples from diverse cropping systems and soil orders in the region. The Comprehensive Assessment of Soil Health, developed at Cornell University in New York, was adapted and combined with other soil health measures. Principal component analysis ( PCA), analysis of variance, and a correlation analysis were applied to the dataset to determine if management (i.e., cropping system) or pedogenesis (i.e., soil order) was more important as a driver of soil health test results. It was determined that cropping systems explained more variance in the dataset than soil order. Although total carbon explained the most variation in the PCA, it was highly correlated to other measures of carbon such as permanganate oxidizable carbon and respiration that may be more responsive to management changes. In addition, autoclaved- citrate extractable protein, a test for nitrogen mineralization, was more related to measures of soil carbon than other measures of soil nitrogen availability. The findings of this study provide a foundation for interpreting soil health testing results for this region and will help indicate which cropping systems and soil management practices have the greatest potential for improving soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-adapted-weibull-function-for-agricultural-applications&quot;&gt;An adapted Weibull function for agricultural applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weibull function is applied extensively in the life sciences and engineering but underused in agriculture. The function was consequently adapted to include parameters and metrics that increase its utility for characterizing agricultural processes. The parameters included initial and final dependent variables (Y-0 and Y-F, respectively), initial independent variable (x(0)), a scale constant (k), and a shape constant (c). The primary metrics included mode, integral average, domain, skewness, and kurtosis. Nested within the Weibull function are the Mitscherlich and Rayleigh functions where c is fixed at 1 and 2, respectively. At least one of the three models provided an excellent fit to six example agricultural datasets, as evidenced by large adjusted coefficient of determination (R-A(2) &amp;gt;= 0.9266), small normalized mean bias error (MBEN &amp;lt;= 1.49%), and small normalized standard error of regression (SERN &amp;lt;= 8.08%). The Mitscherlich function provided the most probable (P-X) representation of corn (Zea mays L.) yield (P-M = 87.2%); Rayleigh was most probable for soil organic carbon depth profile (P-R = 96.4%); and Weibull was most probable for corn seedling emergence (P-W = 100%), nitrous oxide emissions (P-W = 100%), nitrogen mineralization (P-W = 58.4%), and soil water desorption (P-W = 100%). The Weibull fit to the desorption data was also equivalent to those of the well-established van Genuchten and Groenevelt-Grant desorption models. It was concluded that the adapted Weibull function has good potential for widespread and informative application to agricultural data and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparison-of-cornell-sprinkle-infiltrometer-and-double-ring-infiltrometer-methods-for-measuring-steady-infiltration-rate&quot;&gt;Comparison of Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer and double-ring infiltrometer methods for measuring steady infiltration rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infiltration rate measurements are used to assess soil health and develop land management practices to address runoff from precipitation and irrigation. Differences in observed infiltration rates determined by available methods can be attributed to both the technique and soil property differences. The primary objective of this study was to compare two methods for measuring steady infiltration rate: the Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer (single-ring) method (CSI), and the double-ring infiltrometer method (DRI). Measurements were made at four sites using four replications of 13 sets of conditions (52 total paired measurements). The relationship between CSI and DRI measurements was significant (p &amp;lt; .001) and strong (R-2 = .71). For 8 of 13 conditions, there was no difference between CSI and DRI steady infiltration rates. Variability in measurements was high (CVs ranged from 0.04 to 1.18) but similar for both methods. Both CSI and DRI results were strongly related to saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil layer determined using a laboratory constant head method on intact soil cores. Overall, results suggest that estimates of steady infiltration rate determined by the CSI and standard DRI methods are comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reducing-the-number-of-experiments-required-for-modelling-the-hydrocracking-process-with-kriging-through-bayesian-transfer-learning&quot;&gt;Reducing the number of experiments required for modelling the hydrocracking process with kriging through Bayesian transfer learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective is to improve the learning of a regression model of the hydrocracking process using a reduced number of observations. When a new catalyst is used for the hydrocracking process, a new model must be fitted. Generating new data is expensive and therefore it is advantageous to limit the amount of new data generation. Our idea is to use a second data set of measurements made on a process using an old catalyst. This second data set is large enough to fit performing models for the old catalyst. In this work, we use the knowledge from this old catalyst to learn a model on the new catalyst. This task is a transfer learning task. We show that the results are greatly improved with a Bayesian approach to transfer linear model and kriging model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;response-adaptive-rerandomization&quot;&gt;Response-adaptive rerandomization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rerandomization has recently attracted more attention in the literature randomized experiments. It leverages covariate information of participants to achieve a well-balanced allocation, and thus improves the efficiency of inference. However, by only considering covariate information, it may lead to potential ethical issues in clinical trials as a large number of patients might be assigned to the inferior treatment arm. To mitigate this issue, we propose a response-adaptive rerandomization scheme by incorporating response information for two-arm comparative clinical trials. Not only is our method applicable to both continuous and binary outcomes, but it also demonstrates desirable statistical and ethical properties. Extensive simulation studies are performed to illustrate the practicality and superiority of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancing-the-mechanical-and-hydraulic-properties-of-coarse-quartz-sand-using-a-water-soluble-hydrogel-based-on-bacterial-alginate-for-novel-application-in-agricultural-contexts&quot;&gt;Enhancing the mechanical and hydraulic properties of coarse quartz sand using a water-soluble hydrogel based on bacterial alginate for novel application in agricultural contexts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is generating severe changes in the physical behavior of soils (i.e., soil structure, mechanical resistance, and water conductivity), causing negative impacts on different agricultural systems and, therefore, threatening food security. To cope with this situation, hydrogels based on biopolymers have been proposed to modify the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of complex porous materials such as soils, yet most of them are nonsoluble, making their application at field level laborious. In this study, we investigated the effect of a water-soluble hydrogel based on bacterial alginate on the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of coarse quartz sand. The results from unconfined uniaxial compression test showed that the strength of the sand treated with hydrogel increased by 94.5%, whereas hydraulic conductivity decreased 33%. Interestingly, we observed that bacterial alginate and hydrogel shifted the mechanics of the fluid phase toward a Darcy regime. The aggregate stability tests showed that coarse quartz sand treated with hydrogel displays larger mean weight diameter, reaching 1.5 mm compared with 0.12 mm of the control (i.e., coarse quartz sand). Finally, transmission light microscopy imaging of the hydrogel treatment revealed a new three-dimensional matrix between the quartz sand particles, changing the microaggregates and macroaggregates and providing a modified structure of the sand material. Our findings suggest that the use of the water-soluble hydrogel improves the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of coarse quartz sand, allowing better soil conservation against climate change-related phenomena, and is also potentially applicable in agricultural systems facing water scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predicting-rootzone-soil-moisture-from-surface-observations-in-cropland-using-an-exponential-filter&quot;&gt;Predicting rootzone soil moisture from surface observations in cropland using an exponential filter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rootzone soil moisture provides valuable information to guide in-season management decisions in rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems. Measuring rootzone soil moisture usually requires the deployment of a vertical array of sensors, which can be costly and labor intensive. In this study, we tested the skill of an exponential filter to estimate rootzone soil moisture conditions from a time series of near-surface soil moisture observations. Daily soil moisture observations from a sensor at 10-cm depth were used to predict the soil water content at 30-, 50-, and 70-cm depth, and across the entire soil profile (0-to-80-cm depth) in four agricultural fields under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The characteristic time length was the only fitting parameter of the model, which was optimized for each site based on the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) score. Across the four sites, the mean NS score at individual soil layers ranged from -0.64 to 0.73, but the NS score at the profile level ranged between 0.29 and 0.84. Predictions of soil water storage at the profile level based on near-surface soil moisture and the exponential filter resulted in average RMSE of 11 mm across the four locations. Our study shows that in agricultural fields the exponential filter performs better when considering the entire soil profile rather than individual soil layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-soil-microbial-residence-time-at-the-global-scale&quot;&gt;Mapping soil microbial residence time at the global scale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil microbes are the fundamental engine for carbon (C) cycling. Microbial residence time (MRT) therefore determines the mineralization of soil organic C, releasing C as heterotrophic respiration and contributing substantially to the C efflux in terrestrial ecosystems. We took use of a comprehensive dataset (2627 data points) and calculated the MRT based on the basal respiration and microbial biomass C. Large variations in MRT were found among biomes, with the largest MRT in boreal forests and grasslands and smallest in natural wetlands. Biogeographic patterns of MRT were found along climate variables (temperature and precipitation), vegetation variables (root C density and net primary productivity), and edaphic factors (soil texture, pH, topsoil porosity, soil C, and total nitrogen). Among environmental factors, edaphic properties dominate the MRT variations. We further mapped the MRT at the global scale with an empirical model. The simulated and observed MRT were highly consistent at plot- (R-2= .86), site- (R-2 = .88), and biome- (R-2 = .99) levels. The global average of MRT was estimated to be 38 (+/- 5) days. A clear latitudinal biogeographic pattern was found for MRT with lower values in tropical regions and higher values in the Arctic. The biome- and global-level estimates of MRT serve as valuable data for parameterizing and benchmarking microbial models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;achievable-agricultural-soil-carbon-sequestration-across-europe-from-country-specific-estimates&quot;&gt;Achievable agricultural soil carbon sequestration across Europe from country-specific estimates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of soils in the global carbon cycle and in reducing GHG emissions from agriculture has been increasingly acknowledged. The ‘4 per 1000’ (4p1000) initiative has become a prominent action plan for climate change mitigation and achieve food security through an annual increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks by 0.4%, (i.e. 4 parts per thousand per year). However, the feasibility of the 4p1000 scenario and, more generally, the capacity of individual countries to implement soil carbon sequestration (SCS) measures remain highly uncertain. Here, we evaluated country-specific SCS potentials of agricultural land for 24 countries in Europe. Based on a detailed survey of available literature, we estimate that between 0.1% and 27% of the agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can potentially be compensated by SCS annually within the next decades. Measures varied widely across countries, indicating differences in country-specific environmental conditions and agricultural practices. None of the countries’ SCS potential reached the aspirational goal of the 4p1000 initiative, suggesting that in order to achieve this goal, a wider range of measures and implementation pathways need to be explored. Yet, SCS potentials exceeded those from previous pan-European modelling scenarios, underpinning the general need to include national/regional knowledge and expertise to improve estimates of SCS potentials. The complexity of the chosen SCS measurement approaches between countries ranked from tier 1 to tier 3 and included the effect of different controlling factors, suggesting that methodological improvements and standardization of SCS accounting are urgently required. Standardization should include the assessment of key controlling factors such as realistic areas, technical and practical feasibility, trade-offs with other GHG and climate change. Our analysis suggests that country-specific knowledge and SCS estimates together with improved data sharing and harmonization are crucial to better quantify the role of soils in offsetting anthropogenic GHG emissions at global level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improved-accuracy-and-reduced-uncertainty-in-greenhouse-gas-inventories-by-refining-the-ipcc-emission-factor-for-direct-n2o-emissions-from-nitrogen-inputs-to-managed-soils&quot;&gt;Improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty in greenhouse gas inventories by refining the IPCC emission factor for direct N2O emissions from nitrogen inputs to managed soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most national GHG inventories estimating direct N2O emissions from managed soils rely on a default Tier 1 emission factor (EF1) amounting to 1% of nitrogen inputs. Recent research has, however, demonstrated the potential for refining the EF1 considering variables that are readily available at national scales. Building on existing reviews, we produced a large dataset (n = 848) enriched in dry and low latitude tropical climate observations as compared to former global efforts and disaggregated the EF1 according to most meaningful controlling factors. Using spatially explicit N fertilizer and manure inputs, we also investigated the implications of using the EF1 developed as part of this research and adopted by the 2019 IPCC refinement report. Our results demonstrated that climate is a major driver of emission, with an EF1 three times higher in wet climates (0.014, 95% CI 0.011-0.017) than in dry climates (0.005, 95% CI 0.000-0.011). Likewise, the form of the fertilizer markedly modulated the EF1 in wet climates, where the EF1 for synthetic and mixed forms (0.016, 95% CI 0.013-0.019) was also almost three times larger than the EF1 for organic forms (0.006; 95% CI 0.001-0.011). Other factors such as land cover and soil texture, C content, and pH were also important regulators of the EF1. The uncertainty associated with the disaggregated EF1 was considerably reduced as compared to the range in the 2006 IPCC guidelines. Compared to estimates from the 2006 IPCC EF1, emissions based on the 2019 IPCC EF1 range from 15% to 46% lower in countries dominated by dry climates to 7%-37% higher in countries with wet climates and high synthetic N fertilizer consumption. The adoption of the 2019 IPCC EF1 will allow parties to improve the accuracy of emissions’ inventories and to better target areas for implementing mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-public-private-partnerships-in-improving-global-food-security&quot;&gt;The role of public-private partnerships in improving global food security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global food security is at a tipping point. After decades of both absolute and relative improvement in food security worldwide, climate change, market disruptions and declining productivity have reversed the trend. After four decades of improving food security, both more people and a larger portion of the global population are hungry today than in 2015. In response, researchers and their funders, governments, industries and interest groups are urging renewed collaboration and partnerships to recover and return to accelerate food production and to improve food distribution. Recently some public academics and civil society organizations are opposing these public-private partnerships (P3s). The article reviews the context, discusses the logic for P3s and explores the range of P3s that have been used and their impacts on the global agri-food system. We conclude that rather than reversing direction, the use of both strategic and tactical partnerships should be accelerated in order to improve global food security.&lt;/p&gt;
