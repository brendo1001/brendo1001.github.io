&lt;p&gt;Generalized additive models are used to identify predictor variables associated with summer groundwater levels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer groundwater levels are influenced uniquely by region-specific seasonal climate and hydrological variables&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycles-L is a coupled agroecosystem hydrologic modeling system that couples an agroecosystem model with a 3-D land surface hydrologic model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycles-L simulated well stream discharge, grain crops yield, and nitrogen exports in the stream at a 730-ha agricultural experimental watershed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several methods to approximate soil water residence time from commonly available hydrological variables are introduced and compared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global terrestrial water cycle is currently accelerating and projected to do so in future climate scenarios&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precipitation changes play a more dominant role in the acceleration of the terrestrial water cycle when compared to evapotranspiration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Na- and Ca-montmorillonite and the swell-indicating properties (i.e., free swell index, water uptake capacity, and cation exchange capacity (CEC)) of clay mineral mixtures can be estimated using visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectral features. The data regarding four types of reference clay minerals (KGa-1b, kaolinite; IYd, illite; SWy-3, Na-montmorillonite; STx-1b, Ca-montmorillonite) and binary and ternary mixtures of the reference clay minerals (SWy-3/KGa-1b/IYd, and STx-1b/KGa-1b/IYd) with specific mass percentage ratios were used as a calibration dataset. The absorption spectral features could be correlated well with changes in the clay mineral content of the mixtures. The leave-one-out cross-validation results showed that the partial least square regression (PLSR) calibration models produced the best prediction in the following order: Na or Ca-montmorillonite, kaolinite, and illite amounts in the mixtures. The calibration models produced better predictions in the ascending order of CEC, free swell index, and water uptake capacity, regardless of the multivariate statistical methods and type of exchangeable cations in montmorillonite. Validation using an independent dataset indicated that the PLSR model predicted the Na- and Ca-montmorillonite content in clay mineral mixtures and bentonite samples. The results of this study provide the possibility of using Vis-NIR absorption spectral features as a screening tool for predicting the montmorillonite content with different interlayer cations in relatively pure clay soils (e.g., bentonite), if the calibration model is developed using the specific montmorillonite contained in the clay soil of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quantifying-uncertainty-in-land-use-land-cover-classification-using-conformal-statistics&quot;&gt;Quantifying uncertainty in land-use land-cover classification using conformal statistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-use land-cover (LULC) change is one of the most important anthropogenic threats to biodiversity and ecosystems integrity. As a result, the systematic generation of annual regional, national, and global LULC map products derived from the classification of satellite imagery data have become critical inputs for multiple scientific disciplines. The importance of quantifying pixel-level uncertainty to improve the robustness of downstream analyses has long been acknowledged but this practice is still not widely adopted in the generation of these LULC products. The lack of uncertainty quantification is likely due to the fact that most approaches that have been put forward for this task are too computationally intensive for large-scale analysis (e.g., bootstrapping). In this article, we describe how conformal statistics can be used to quantify pixel-level uncertainty in a way that is not computationally intensive, is statistically rigorous despite relying on few assumptions, and can be used together with any classification algorithm that produces class probabilities. Our simulation results show how the size of the predictive sets created by conformal statistics can be used as an indicator of classification uncertainty at the pixel level. Our analysis based on data from the Brazilian Amazon reveals that both forest and water have high certainty whereas pasture and the “natural (other)” category have substantial uncertainty. This information can guide additional ground-truth data collection and the resulting raster combining the LULC classification with the uncertainty results can be used to communicate in a transparent way to downstream users which classified pixels have high or low uncertainty. Given the importance of systematic LULC maps and uncertainty quantification, we believe that this approach will find wide use in the remote sensing community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-multi-scale-algorithm-for-the-nisar-mission-high-resolution-soil-moisture-product&quot;&gt;A multi-scale algorithm for the NISAR mission high-resolution soil moisture product&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a multi-scale soil moisture algorithm for the upcoming NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission to estimate high-resolution (200 [m]) soil moisture (the water content of the soil). The algorithm takes advantage of the high-resolution (∼10 [m]) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter and coarse resolution modeled/reanalysis soil moisture products (∼ 9 [km]) to create a high-resolution (200 [m]) soil moisture product at a global extent. The end goal of the algorithm is to remove dependencies on any complex modeling, tedious retrieval steps, or multiple ancillary data needs, and subsequently decrease the degrees of freedom to achieve optimal accuracy in soil moisture retrievals. The use of modeled/reanalysis soil moisture products with high temporal resolution gives an added advantage in reducing the temporal mismatch between the two different inputs used in the algorithm. In this study, the proposed algorithm is tested using L-band UAVSAR backscatter (σ°) data and Advanced Land Observing Satellite −2 (ALOS-2) SAR σ° as a substitute for the NISAR L-band SAR observations. The algorithm uses the L-band SAR σ° to disaggregate coarse resolution (∼9 [km]) reanalysis soil moisture of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) to a high-resolution of ∼200 [m] soil moisture product. The potential of the algorithm is demonstrated over three sites in different hydroclimatic regions of the world, such as India, the USA, and Canada. The high-resolution soil moisture estimates were compared with the in-situ soil moisture measurements available for three sites (North India, Southern California, and Carman, Manitoba, Canada). In North India, in-situ measurements are from paddy crops with high vegetation water content, the unbiased root-mean-square-error (ubRMSE) for the high-resolution soil moisture retrievals was found to be 0.036 [m3/m3] with a bias of −0.051 [m3/m3]. For the southern California site, the validation statistics shows low ubRMSE of 0.027 [m3/m3] and a low bias of 0.016 [m3/m3]. At the Carman, Manitoba test site of Canada, where in-situ soil measurements were available for multiple crop types, the comparison shows that the ubRMSE for all the crop types lies below 0.05 [m3/m3] with an average bias of &amp;lt;0.07 [m3/m3]. The result confirms that the proposed algorithm meets the NISAR mission’s accuracy goals, i.e., 0.06 [m3/m3] ubRMSE over areas with vegetation water content (VWC) below 5 [kg/m2]. Rigorous validation work will still need to be carried out in the future based on the availability of L-band SAR datasets and after the launch of the NISAR satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;filling-the-maize-yield-gap-based-on-precision-agriculture--a-maxent-approach&quot;&gt;Filling the maize yield gap based on precision agriculture – A MaxEnt approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precision agriculture (PA) and yield gap (Yg) analysis are promising strategies to achieve the desired sustainable intensification of agricultural production systems. Current crop Yg approaches do not consider the internal field yield variability caused by soil properties. Topographic and edaphic characteristics causing consistent high and low yield patterns in time and space can be interpreted as an ecological niche and used as proxies for potential yield (Yp) and Yg. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are statistical models originally developed to forecast a species’ niche. However, its application to analyse crop yield spatio-temporal variability has never been made. This study aimed to fill this void by developing a novel approach: i) to quantify the magnitude and spatio-temporal distribution of Yp and Yg, ii) to identify the main factors that cause the Yg, and iii) to provide statistical and agronomical interpretation of the data to reduce the Yg. We performed this work using high-resolution maize yield maps from three seasons, with an ancillary dataset composed of soil electrical conductivity, soil properties and digital elevation models provided by “Quinta da Cholda”, Portugal. The yield maps were averaged, resulting in a standardised multiyear yield map. The 90th and 10th yield percentiles were interpreted as proxies for Yp and Yg, and analysed by an ENM machine learning algorithm – maximum entropy (MaxEnt). The average Yg and Yp were quantified as 1.5 and 19.1 ton/ha. Yp was characterised by having silty, richer soils and lower elevations, with several nutritional factors above the critical limits to maintain higher yields. Yg had loam soils coupled with higher relative elevations and lower nutrition content. This innovative modelling approach can efficiently manage high-dimensional spatio-temporal data to support advanced PA solutions, allowing detailed support for narrowing the Yg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;real-time-social-media-sentiment-analysis-for-rapid-impact-assessment-of-floods&quot;&gt;Real-time social media sentiment analysis for rapid impact assessment of floods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional approaches to flood modelling mostly rely on hydrodynamic physical simulations. While these simulations can be accurate, they are computationally expensive and prohibitively so when thinking about real-time prediction based on dynamic environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, social media platforms such as Twitter are often used by people to communicate during a flooding event, but discovering which tweets hold useful information is the key challenge in extracting information from posts in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we present a novel model for flood forecasting and monitoring that makes use of a transformer network that assesses the severity of a flooding situation based on sentiment analysis of the multimodal inputs (text and images). We also present an experimental comparison of a range of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for image processing and natural language processing. Finally, we demonstrate that information induced from tweets can be used effectively to visualise fine-grained geographical flood-related information dynamically and in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subsoil-carbon-loss&quot;&gt;Subsoil carbon loss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A field-based study of 4.5 years of whole-soil warming reveals that warming stimulates loss of structurally complex organic carbon at the same rate as that for bulk organic carbon in subsoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definition-of-spatial-copula-based-dependence-using-a-family-of-non-gaussian-spatial-random-fields&quot;&gt;Definition of Spatial Copula Based Dependence Using a Family of Non-Gaussian Spatial Random Fields&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spatial structures of natural variables are often very complex due to the different physical chemical or biological processes which contributed to the emergence of the fields. These structures often show non-Gaussian spatial dependence. Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of approaches that can explicitly consider non-Gaussian behavior. In this contribution, a very flexible way of defining non-Gaussian spatial dependence is presented. The approach is based on a kind of continuous deformation of fields with different Gaussian spatial dependence. Theoretical examples illustrate the methodology for a wide variety of non-Gaussian structures. A real-life example of groundwater quality parameters shows the practical applicability of the geostatistical model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points
A method to define a wide range of non-Gaussian spatial dependence is presented&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conditional simulation approach for these non-Gaussian structures via Monte Carlo optimization is presented&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundwater quality parameter study demonstrates the benefits of the approach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;response-of-soil-organic-carbon-stock-to-land-use-is-modulated-by-soil-hydraulic-properties&quot;&gt;Response of soil organic carbon stock to land use is modulated by soil hydraulic properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the effects of land use on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is important to develop practices that promote agricultural sustainability and mitigate climate change. The objective of this study was to explore whether the effects of land use on SOC stock differed with soil type and, particularly, with soil hydraulic properties. For this purpose, 90 sites from the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand, were sampled to a depth of 30 cm. The sampled sites consisted of long-term (&amp;gt;20 years) dryland pasture [DP], irrigated pasture [IP], and irrigated cropping [IC] covering three contrasting soil types with different soil drainage levels, including well drained Lismore (LIS) soil, imperfectly drained Templeton (TEM) soil, and poorly drained Waterton/Temuka (WAT) soil. On average, compared with DP, IP increased SOC and hot water extractable carbon (HWEC) stock at all depths; IC decreased SOC and HWEC at 0–15 cm. The results highlighted that the effects of land use change from DP to IP and IC on total SOC and HWEC stock significantly differed between soil types. The greatest gains in SOC and HWEC stocks following change from DP to IP were found in LIS soil; the greatest losses in SOC and HWEC stocks following change from DP to IC were found in WAT soil; and no significant differences in SOC stocks with land use changes were found in TEM soil. The results implied that the interaction between land use and soil type on SOC and HWEC stocks was associated with soil hydraulic properties (e.g. available water capacity and field capacity) that regulate the response of C inputs (net primary productivity) and outputs (microbial decomposition) to land use and management practices (e.g. irrigation and cultivation). Therefore, soil hydraulic properties should be taken into account in designing land use for the purpose of SOC sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;life-cycle-assessment-life-cycle-cost-and-exergoeconomic-analysis-of-different-tillage-systems-in-safflower-production-by-micronutrients&quot;&gt;Life cycle assessment, life cycle cost, and exergoeconomic analysis of different tillage systems in safflower production by micronutrients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, one of the biggest challenges facing agriculture has been sustainability. To achieve sustainability goals, it is necessary to consider the compatibility of environmental, economic, and energy aspects. The main aim of this study is to conduct an environmental-economic-exergy assessment of safflower production under different tillage systems with Zn and Fe micronutrients using life cycle cost (LCC), life cycle assessment (LCA), and exergoeconomic analysis. For this purpose, three scenarios are evaluated: conventional tillage (Sc-CT), reduced tillage (Sc-RT), and no-tillage setup (Sc-NT). The LCA method ReCiPe2016 is used to assess environmental impacts based on one ton of safflower seeds as a functional unit. In addition, the emissions social cost (ESC) is considered as a hidden part of LCC in safflower production. Finally, a combination of cumulative exergy demand and net profit is used to compute an exergoeconomic index in agriculture as a novelty. Results indicate that On-Farm emissions derived from nitrogen and diesel fuel are the most significant contributor, accounting for over 50% of the impact on human health and ecosystems. Sc-RT with 62.62 Pt and Sc-NT with 71.66 Pt are the best and worst LCA scenarios of this study. Sc-CT has the highest ESC, with 51.14 $, and Sc-NT has the lowest LCC, with 380.39 $. Exergy results show that nitrogen fertilizer has the largest share of cumulative exergy demand, and Sc-RT, with 0.073 $ MJ−1, is the best scenario from an exergoeconomic perspective. In summary, Sc-RT, Sc-CT, and Sc-NT are ranked first, second, and third, respectively, from an environmental-economic-exergy-friendly point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-diversified-crop-rotations-influence-soil-physical-health-a-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;Do diversified crop rotations influence soil physical health? A meta-analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crop management practices such as rotation, as well as climatic and edaphic factors, modulate soil physical health. However, the overall magnitude of crop rotation benefits on soil physical health properties across a broad range of different conditions remains uncertain. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis on 865 paired comparisons from 148 rotation studies to examine i) how crop diversity affected soil physical health properties: bulk density, aggregate stability, porosity, infiltration rate, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, and ii) how management practices, climatic, and edaphic factors influenced crop diversity effects. Overall, increased crop diversity (i.e., number of crop species in the rotation) significantly reduced bulk density (−1.6 ± 1.3%), enhanced soil aggregation (15.9 ± 12.7%), improved porosity (3.1 ± 2.0%), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (112.8 ± 57.9%), but did not significantly change infiltration rate (92.2 ± 98.7%) compared to less diverse systems. Compared to using conventional tillage and cereals-only rotations, diverse rotations combined with conservation tillage or including grain legumes performed even better in enhancing both soil aggregation and porosity. Diverse crop rotations managed for 5–10 yr showed greater benefits in regions experiencing mean annual precipitation &amp;gt; 900 mm, and in medium- and fine-textured soils. Among soil physical health properties, saturated hydraulic conductivity was the most responsive to management practices. Based on this meta-analysis, we conclude that rotations including diverse crop species and grain legumes, managed under conservation tillage are best for improving soil physical health, and thus should be considered when designing and developing sustainable cropping systems that promote soil health, system resilience, and crop productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-numerical-approach-for-modeling-crack-closure-and-infiltrated-flow-in-cracked-soils&quot;&gt;A numerical approach for modeling crack closure and infiltrated flow in cracked soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil cracks generated in natural fields will change soil structure and provide pathways for preferential flow. Although most simulations have focused on the influences of surface cracks or subsurface cracks in the fields, few studies are conducted on the deformable cracks extending from soil surface to deep soil layer. The present study addresses a fundamental issue and investigates the differences in water flow during infiltration processes of deformable and non-deformable cracked soils. Based on the discrete crack network model, a two-dimensional numerical approach is proposed to investigate the preferential flow in deformable cracked soil. Numerical simulations on water flow are implemented for matrix domain and cracks with the finite element method, which are discretized into solid elements and zero thickness elements, respectively. The proposed model is validated through explicit modeling and experimental observation and then compared with deformable crack approach. It is further employed to simulate the infiltration process of deformable cracked soil revealing significant differences in infiltration characteristics between deformable and non-deformable cracked soils, even if the cracks all act as preferential flow pathways. Although the saturation in crack closure of numerical model is variable during infiltration process, the effect of saturation is still affected by the number of cracks. Furthermore, cracks do not entirely close over a long period of infiltration, and thus they can become preferential flow pathways in subsequent infiltration events. These findings highlight the gap in simulations of water infiltration in cracked soil and the potential for erroneous simulations of water condition when cracks cannot be deformable during infiltration process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ecosystem-scale-modelling-of-soil-carbon-dynamics-time-for-a-radical-shift-of-perspective&quot;&gt;Ecosystem-scale modelling of soil carbon dynamics: Time for a radical shift of perspective?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, several researchers working on the development of “biogeochemical” or “ecosystem-scale” models of soil carbon dynamics have reported struggling with a number of difficult challenges. At the same time, work in this area has focused exclusively on microbial activity described at a macro-ecological level, and has entirely bypassed the abundant literature produced in the last two decades on the study of soil processes at the microscale. Juxtaposition of these different observations suggests that a radical shift of perspective is in order. In this general context, the present article carries out an in-depth analysis of several of the key limitations of current ecosystem-scale models and recommends a number of steps to shift the perspective to one that is argued to have a better chance of success in the relatively short time we have to address several pressing soil-related environmental problems. These steps, in particular, require the development of large-spatial-scale models of soil carbon dynamics to be far more interdisciplinary than it has been till now, and to adopt a “bottom-up” approach, building on what the research at the microscale reveals about soil processes. Nevertheless, because it may assist in upscaling efforts, it is argued that some room should be preserved for work to continue on the search for empirical models applicable at large spatial scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;molecular-complexity-and-diversity-of-persistent-soil-organic-matter&quot;&gt;Molecular complexity and diversity of persistent soil organic matter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing and increasing organic matter in soil requires greater understanding of the mechanisms driving its persistence through resistance to microbial decomposition. Conflicting evidence exists for whether persistent soil organic matter (SOM) is molecularly complex and diverse. As such, this study used a novel application of graph networks with pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify the complexity and diversity of persistent SOM, defined as SOM that persists through time (soil radiocarbon age) and soil depth. We analyzed soils from the Cooloola giant podzol chronosequence across a large gradient of soil depths (0–15 m) and SOM radiocarbon ages (modern to 19,000 years BP). We found that the most persistent SOM on this gradient was highly aromatic and had the lowest molecular complexity and diversity. By contrast, fresh surface SOM had higher molecular complexity and diversity, with high contributions of plant-derived lignins and polysaccharides. These findings indicate that persisting SOM declines in molecular complexity and diversity over geological timescales and soil depths, with aromatic SOM compounds persisting longer with mineral association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-simple-soil-organic-carbon-level-metric-beyond-the-organic-carbon-to-clay-ratio&quot;&gt;A simple soil organic carbon level metric beyond the organic carbon-to-clay ratio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil is a precious and non-renewable resource that is under increasing pressure and the development of indicators to monitor its state is pivotal. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for key physical, chemical and biological soil properties and thus a central indicator of soil quality and soil health. The content of SOC is driven by many abiotic factors, such as texture and climate, and is therefore strongly site-specific, which complicates, for example, the search for appropriate threshold values to differentiate healthy from less healthy soils. The SOC:clay ratio has been introduced as a normalized SOC level metric to indicate soils’ structural condition, with classes ranging from degraded (&amp;lt;1:13) to very good (&amp;gt;1:8). This study applied the ratio to 2958 topsoils (0–30 cm) in the German Agricultural Soil Inventory and showed that it is not a suitable SOC level metric since strongly biased, misleading and partly insensitive to SOC changes. The proportion of soils with SOC levels classified as degraded increased exponentially with clay content, indicating the indicator’s overly strong clay dependence. Thus, 94% of all Chernozems, which are known to have elevated SOC contents and a favourable soil structure, were found to have either degraded (61%) or moderate (33%) normalized SOC levels. The ratio between actual and expected SOC (SOC:SOCexp) is proposed as an easy-to-use alternative where expected SOC is derived from a regression between SOC and clay content. This ratio allows a simple but unbiased estimate of the clay-normalized SOC level. The quartiles of this ratio were used to derive threshold values to divide the dataset into the classes degraded, moderate, good and very good. These classes were clearly linked to bulk volume (inverse of bulk density) as an important structural parameter, which was not the case for classes based on the SOC:clay ratio. Therefore, SOC:SOCexp and its temporal dynamic are proposed for limited areas such as regions, states or pedoclimatic zones, for example, in a soil health monitoring context; further testing is, however, recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-cover-crops-impact-labile-c-more-than-total-c&quot;&gt;Do cover crops impact labile C more than total C?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of cover crops (CC) to increase total soil organic C (SOC) concentration can be inconsistent, but labile SOC is considered to be more sensitive to management than total SOC. This leads to two questions: Do CCs impact labile SOC more than total SOC? Do CCs increase labile SOC more rapidly than total SOC? This review compares CC impacts on labile and total SOC based on CC studies reporting both parameters up to 31 Dec 2022. Labile and total SOC concentrations were measured in 31 CC study locations. Cover crops increased labile SOC concentration in 58% (18 of 31) and had no effect in 42% (13 of 31) of locations, suggesting CCs do not increase labile SOC in all cases. Within the 18 locations, CCs increased labile SOC without increasing total SOC in only 19% (6 of 31 locations), while in the rest (12 of 31) of locations, CCs increased both labile and total SOC. Thus, CCs increased labile SOC more rapidly than total SOC in only one-fifth of cases. Also, the few studies that monitored changes in labile SOC with time found CCs do not always increase labile more rapidly than total SOC. In the 12 locations where CCs increased both labile and total SOC, CCs increased labile SOC by 54 ± 30% and total SOC by 23 ± 10%, indicating CCs can increase labile SOC by about two times compared with total SOC in some locations. Increased CC biomass production and reduced residue decomposition can increase labile SOC. Overall, CCs increase labile SOC in most cases but may not always increase labile SOC more rapidly than total SOC although more CC studies monitoring changes in SOC pools with time are needed to better understand CC impacts on SOC fractions under different CC management scenarios and climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To describe various important soil processes like the release of greenhouse gases or the proliferation of microorganisms, it is necessary to assess quantitatively how the geometry and in particular the connectivity of the air-filled pore space of a soil evolves as it is progressively dried. The availability of X-ray computed microtomography (μCT) images of soil samples now allows this information to be obtained directly, without having to rely on the interpretation of macroscopic measurements using capillary theory, as used to be the case. In this general context, we present different methods to describe quantitatively the configuration of the air-filled pore space in 3D μCT images of 20 separate samples of a loamy soil equilibrated at different matric potentials. Even though measures using μCT on such multi-scale materials strongly depend on image resolution, our results show that in general, soil samples most often behave as expected, for example, connectivity increases with higher negative matric potential, while tortuosity decreases. However, simple correlations could not be found between the evolution of quantitative descriptors of the pore space at the different matric potentials and routinely measured macroscopic soil parameters. A statistical analysis of all soil samples concurrently confirmed this lack of correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-farm-management-data-in-analyses-of-decadal-changes-in-soc-stocks-in-the-danish-soil-monitoring-network&quot;&gt;Limitations of farm management data in analyses of decadal changes in SOC stocks in the Danish soil-monitoring network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in agricultural land are an important part of the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry component of national greenhouse gas emission inventories. Furthermore, as climate mitigation strategies and incentives for carbon farming are being developed, accurate estimates of SOC stocks are essential to verify any management-induced changes in SOC. Based on agricultural mineral soils in the Danish soil-monitoring network, we analysed management effects on SOC stocks using data from the two most recent surveys (2009 and 2019). Between 2009 and 2019, the average increase in SOC stock was 1.2 Mg C ha−1 for 0–50 cm despite a loss of 1.2 Mg C ha−1 from the topsoil (0–25 cm), stressing the importance of including deeper soil layers in soil-monitoring networks. Comparing all four national surveys (1986, 1997, 2009, 2019), the mean SOC stock of mineral soils in Denmark appears stable. The change in SOC stock between 2009 and 2019 was analysed in detail in relation to management practices as reported by farmers. We found that the effects of single management factors were difficult to isolate from co-varying factors including soil parameters and that the use of farm management data to explain changes in SOC stocks observed in soil-monitoring networks appears limited. Uncertainty in SOC stock estimates also arises from low sampling frequency and statistical challenges related to regression to the mean. However, repeated stock measurements at decadal intervals still represent a benchmark for the overall development in regional and national SOC storage, as affected by actual farm management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-detectable-upper-limit-of-mineral-associated-organic-carbon-in-temperate-agricultural-soils&quot;&gt;No detectable upper limit of mineral-associated organic carbon in temperate agricultural soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) is the stabilised fraction of soil organic carbon (SOC). Its accrual in the soil can help mitigating climate change. So far, the capacity of soils to store MAOC was believed to be limited by the amount of mineral surfaces available. Here, we provide evidence that up to a total SOC content of about 12%, MAOC is a surprisingly constant fraction of total SOC. This questions the notion of a maximum capacity of soils to store MAOC, at least for temperate soil within the tested range of SOC contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-global-soil-acidification-under-n-deposition&quot;&gt;Mapping global soil acidification under N deposition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The N deposition effects on soil pH across global terrestrial ecosystems remain poorly understood. By conducting a global meta-analysis with paired observations of soil pH under N addition and control from 634 studies spanning major types of terrestrial ecosystems, we showed that soil acidification increased rapidly with N addition amount and was most severe in neutral-pH soils. Grassland soil pH decreased most strongly under high N addition while wetlands were the least acidified. We extrapolated these relationships to global mapping and highlighted the hotspots of soil acidification under current and future atmospheric N deposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil moisture is an important variable controlling many land surface processes and is used to quantify precipitation, drought, flooding, irrigation and other factors that influence decision making and risk-assessment. This paper presents the retrieval of high resolution (
1 km) soil moisture data from Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter measurements using a new bistatic radiative transfer modeling framework (RT1) previously only tested for scatterometer data. The model is applied over a diverse set of landcover types across the entire Po-Valley in Italy over a 4-year time-period from 2016 to 2019. The performance of the soil moisture retrievals is analyzed with respect to the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset. The model parameterisation and retrieval method are chosen such as to constitute a trade-off between a physically plausible and a computationally feasible modeling approach. The results demonstrate the potential of RT1 for the retrieval of high-resolution soil moisture data from SAR time series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-eco-framework-advancing-evidence-based-science-engagement-within-environmental-research-programs-and-organizations&quot;&gt;The ECO framework: advancing evidence-based science engagement within environmental research programs and organizations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread interest in science communication, public engagement with science, and engaged research, a large gap exists between the theories behind science engagement and how it is practiced within the scientific community. The scholarship of science engagement is also fractured, with knowledge and insights fragmented across discourses related to science communication, informal science learning, participatory research, and sustainability science. In the present article, we share a planning tool for integrating evidence and theory from these discourses into effective programs and projects. The ECO framework promotes three distinct and interacting modes of science engagement practice: formative engagement (listening and relationship building), codesign and coproduction (action-oriented partnerships), and broader outreach (expanding networks and dissemination). By planning engagement activities with attention to these three modes of engagement, scientists and scientific research organizations will be better poised to address urgent needs for stronger connections between science and society and increased use of scientific research in decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;empirical-equations-for-estimating-field-capacity-in-dryland-cropping-soils-of-southeastern-australia&quot;&gt;Empirical equations for estimating field capacity in dryland cropping soils of southeastern Australia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root zone soil water content at field capacity, θFC, is often crucial for irrigation scheduling and soil-plant-atmosphere modelling. Although θFC is traditionally determined using methodologies based on matric head or when water flux at the bottom of the root-zone equal to a prescribed negligible flux, these approaches can be problematic for some soils and applications. In this study, a novel water storage approach was used to estimate θFC for 11 soil texture classes in southeastern Australia (northwest Victoria) by employing the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model to simulate gravity drainage from saturation in the active root zone (top 60 cm). Field capacity was specified as the average root zone water content corresponding to a 1% relative change in daily soil water storage. We have also estimated flux-based θFC when prescribed flux at the bottom of the root-zone was 0.1 cm d-1. Three new empirical equations were developed to estimate storage-based θFC as a function of SWAP-simulated drainage flux out of the root zone, the n parameter of the van Genuchten function, and the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, Ks, or the soil water content at − 100 cm matric head. We have evaluated these three new equations in addition to nine published equations for estimating θFC. The three new equations were found to be better predictors of θFC than most of the nine popular equations reported in the literature when compared to flux-based θFC values. Based on findings from this study the new equations are considered to be effective for irrigation scheduling and crop/climate modelling on the dryland soils of Victoria. Future studies will assess the applicability of the new equations to other parts of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;into-the-pedocene--pedology-of-a-changing-world&quot;&gt;Into the Pedocene – Pedology of a changing world&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedology, or the study of soil, is often viewed focusing on soil formation, morphology, mapping and classification. But the study of soil has largely expanded beyond those four areas and now includes quantitative studies using soil legacy data combined with technological advances in data collection, soil sampling and computation. We now have global availability of soil information and can retrieve pedological information for any location including some indication of its accuracy. Scientific and technological developments in pedology have been led by the rise of several subdisciplines including pedometrics, digital soil mapping, spectral pedology, digital soil morphometrics, hydropedology, microbial pedology, astropedology, and the development of pedotransfer functions. With the expansion of pedology and its relevance for understanding the earth system and tackling global change, it is postulated that soil science has now entered the ‘Pedocene’ – a soil epoch equivalent to the Anthropocene. The Pedocene is characterized by the quantitative understanding and evaluation of the global soil system, and the effects of human-induced changes brought to soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-novel-method-incorporating-large-rock-fragments-for-improved-soil-bulk-density-and-carbon-stock-estimation&quot;&gt;A novel method incorporating large rock fragments for improved soil bulk density and carbon stock estimation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil bulk density (BD) is a principal component in estimating the density of soil nutrients and elements including carbon (C). Current literature states that in soils with rock fragment (RF) content ≥3% of the total sample volume, substantial differences in estimated soil organic carbon density (SOCD) are found, depending on the soil BD calculation method chosen, potentially affecting the accuracy of soil nutrient and C inventories. In many soil surveys, soil BD is not measured directly, or the core method is used as the sole determinant of soil BD, potentially neglecting the soil volume dilution effect of RFs larger than the diameter of the cores used. This study uses the core and quantitative pit methods at 10 forest sites in Ireland to determine the BD and RF mass and volume to a depth of 40 cm. The authors examine how large RFs impact BD and subsequently affect the estimated SOCD values by comparing against reference values from established soil sampling and BD calculation methods. The analysis reveals significant variations in the estimated SOCD values when the RF volume in the soil sample exceeds 8% of the total sample volume. A novel method, hereafter named “core-scaling,” combines core and pit sampling methods to account for large RF mass and volume in BD calculations. This study suggests that using the core-scaling method provides results that are strongly correlated with the pit method, thus offering an alternative that can also provide accurate SOCD estimates in soils with a high RF content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridging-structural-and-functional-hydrological-connectivity-in-dryland-ecosystems&quot;&gt;Bridging structural and functional hydrological connectivity in dryland ecosystems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On dryland hillslopes, vegetation water availability is often subsidized by the redistribution of rainfall runoff from bare soil (sources) to vegetation patches (sinks). In regions where rainfall volumes are too low to support spatially continuous plant growth, such functional connectivity between bare soil and vegetated areas enables the establishment and persistence of dryland ecosystems. Increasing the connectivity within bare soil areas can intensify runoff and increase water losses from hillslopes, disrupting this redistribution and reducing the water available to sustain ecosystem function. Inferring functional connectivity (from bare to vegetated, or within bare areas) from structural landscape features is an attractive approach to enable rapid, scalable characterization of dryland ecosystem function from remote observations. Such inference, however, would rely on metrics of structural connectivity, which describe the contiguity of bare soil areas. Several studies have observed non-stationarity in the relations between functional and structural connectivity metrics as rainfall conditions vary. Consequently, the suitability of using structural connectivity to provide a reliable proxy for functional connectivity remains uncertain and motivates the work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations between structural and functional connectivity metrics are established based on model simulations of rainfall-runoff on hillslopes with varying soil properties and vegetation patterns. These relations vary between two hydrologic limits – a ‘local’ (patch-scale) limit, in which functional connectivity is related to structural connectivity, and a ‘global’ (hillslope-scale) limit, in which functional connectivity is most related to the hillslope vegetation fraction regardless of the structural connectivity of bare soil areas. The transition between these limits within the simulations depends on rainfall intensity and duration, and soil permeability. While the local limit may strengthen positive feedbacks between vegetation and water availability, the implications of these limits for dryland functioning need further exploration, particularly considering the timescale separation between storm runoff production and vegetation growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;environmental-factors-and-spatial-dependence-explain-half-of-the-inherent-variation-in-carbon-pools-of-tropical-paddy-soils&quot;&gt;Environmental factors and spatial dependence explain half of the inherent variation in carbon pools of tropical paddy soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current study examined macro-environmental (climate and topography), micro-environmental (soil chemical properties) drivers, and spatially derived parameters that are significantly associated with soil carbon pools (0–15 cm) across tropical paddy-growing areas in Sri Lanka using the data from 987 sampling sites across the country. Redundancy analysis was performed to identify the relationships between the explanatory variables and the variation in different soil carbon pools i.e., total carbon (TC), Microbial Biomass Carbon (MBC), Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon (POXC), and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC). The spatial patterns in soil carbon pools were evaluated using Moran’s eigenvector maps. Results indicated that macro, micro-environmental drivers and spatial variables explained 47% of the inherent variation of the TC, MBC, POXC and DOC. Micro-environmental drivers had a larger unique fraction relative to macro-environmental drivers (4% and 1% of the total variation, respectively). Most of the variation explained by macro-environmental drivers was shared by micro-environmental drivers (11% out of 15%). Among macro-environmental drivers, rainfall and enhanced vegetation index were more strongly related to the soil carbon pools compared to the topography-related factors. In terms of micro-environmental drivers, total N, available K, Ca, and soil pH (H2O) were the best explanatory variables of soil carbon pools. Spatial patterns in soil carbon pools were largely induced by the environmental predictors that are spatially structured. Our findings provide insights into improving the reliability of spatial estimation of the soil carbon by incorporating important soil carbon preditors and quantifying the impacts of environmental changes on soil carbon pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;filling-the-maize-yield-gap-based-on-precision-agriculture--a-maxent-approach&quot;&gt;Filling the maize yield gap based on precision agriculture – A MaxEnt approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precision agriculture (PA) and yield gap (Yg) analysis are promising strategies to achieve the desired sustainable intensification of agricultural production systems. Current crop Yg approaches do not consider the internal field yield variability caused by soil properties. Topographic and edaphic characteristics causing consistent high and low yield patterns in time and space can be interpreted as an ecological niche and used as proxies for potential yield (Yp) and Yg. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are statistical models originally developed to forecast a species’ niche. However, its application to analyse crop yield spatio-temporal variability has never been made. This study aimed to fill this void by developing a novel approach: i) to quantify the magnitude and spatio-temporal distribution of Yp and Yg, ii) to identify the main factors that cause the Yg, and iii) to provide statistical and agronomical interpretation of the data to reduce the Yg. We performed this work using high-resolution maize yield maps from three seasons, with an ancillary dataset composed of soil electrical conductivity, soil properties and digital elevation models provided by “Quinta da Cholda”, Portugal. The yield maps were averaged, resulting in a standardised multiyear yield map. The 90th and 10th yield percentiles were interpreted as proxies for Yp and Yg, and analysed by an ENM machine learning algorithm – maximum entropy (MaxEnt). The average Yg and Yp were quantified as 1.5 and 19.1 ton/ha. Yp was characterised by having silty, richer soils and lower elevations, with several nutritional factors above the critical limits to maintain higher yields. Yg had loam soils coupled with higher relative elevations and lower nutrition content. This innovative modelling approach can efficiently manage high-dimensional spatio-temporal data to support advanced PA solutions, allowing detailed support for narrowing the Yg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-enmap-imaging-spectroscopy-mission-towards-operations&quot;&gt;The EnMAP imaging spectroscopy mission towards operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) is a high-resolution imaging spectroscopy remote sensing mission that was successfully launched on April 1st, 2022. Equipped with a prism-based dual-spectrometer, EnMAP performs observations in the spectral range between 418.2
 and 2445.5
 with 224 bands and a high radiometric and spectral accuracy and stability. EnMAP products, with a ground instantaneous field-of-view of 
 at a swath width of 30
, allow for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of surface variables from frequently and consistently acquired observations on a global scale. This article presents the EnMAP mission and details the activities and results of the Launch and Early Orbit and Commissioning Phases until November 1st, 2022. The mission capabilities and expected performances for the operational Routine Phase are provided for existing and future EnMAP users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measurement-of-lime-movement-and-dissolution-in-acidic-soils-using-mid-infrared-spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Measurement of lime movement and dissolution in acidic soils using mid-infrared spectroscopy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acidification of surface and sub-surface soils limits agricultural production globally. Conventional surface application of lime is the most common amelioration approach for surface acidity. However, amelioration of sub-surface acidity is challenging to achieve using this approach. Testing the efficacy of liming to treat acidity through the soil profile via the measurement of lime movement requires high throughput information about soil properties at a high spatial resolution, which can be time consuming and expensive using traditional laboratory analysis. Here, we investigated the potential of Mid Infrared (MIR) spectroscopy as a tool to monitor lime dissolution and vertical movement through soils at high spatial resolution. Soil samples were collected at 2.5 cm intervals to 20 cm depth at three trial sites in South Australia, with various lime treatments applied either 6 years or 1 year prior to sampling. MIR Partial least squares regression (PLSR) predictions were undertaken to measure lime dissolution and alkalinity movement via soil pH, and undissolved lime presence via soil carbonate concentrations. Lime balance calculations were then performed to determine the fate of applied lime and assess efficacy of various rates of lime products applied at the surface only or via incorporation. MIR-PLSR prediction model performance was strong for both soil pH (R2 = 0.923 and RMSE = 0.202) and carbonate (R2 =0.829 and RMSE=0.042 CO3%). Results indicated the movement of alkalinity at all sites was limited, and revealed increased movement at the longer-term (∼6 years) vs shorter-term (∼1 year) sites where lime was surface applied. Lime balance calculations indicated that residual lime remained in the top 7.5 cm of the soil profile while soils remained acidic below this depth. Findings suggest that incorporation of residual lime and additional lime applications may be necessary to remediate sub-surface acidity. A decision tree was developed to inform management of surface and sub-surface soil acidity. The study validates the potential of MIR spectroscopy to measure and monitor the effectiveness and movement of lime with improved resolution in acidic soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;downscaling-legacy-soil-information-for-hydrological-soil-mapping-using-multinomial-logistic-regression&quot;&gt;Downscaling legacy soil information for hydrological soil mapping using multinomial logistic regression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Africa, there is a growing demand for large scale detailed hydrological soil maps for modelling and management purposes. However, imbalanced legacy soil information often impedes the accurate creation of such maps by not being representative of the environmental complexity of large-scale catchments and containing imbalanced soil class distributions, often resulting in the loss of minority soil classes, which are often of great hydrological importance (e.g., wetland and riparian soils). In this study, we proposed a new downscaling approach to handle spatially localised legacy soil data within a larger low resolution legacy soil dataset to create an accurate hydrological soil map of the macro-scale (5790 km2) Sabie-Sand catchment using multinomial logistic regression (MNLR). The spatially localised legacy data was downscaled using k-means clustering and added to the broader legacy dataset. Five levels of legacy soil data were analysed in their representation of environmental covariates using QQ-plots and a Welsh’s t-test and their mapping accuracy using confusion matrix’s and Kappa coefficient statistics. However, MNLR also requires balanced soil classes. The value of the best performing legacy soil dataset was also compared to using all available soil information after both had their soil class distributions fully balanced using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The 500 ha/observation-SMOTE dataset resulted in the most accurate hydrological soil map with a validation point accuracy of 73% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.60, substantially outperforming the other downscaled soil maps as well as the SMOTE balanced dataset using all available soil information. This was due to the decreased variation between observations and catchment means, where the 500 ha/observation dataset yielded the least variation between soil observation and catchment datasets and well as reducing the class imbalance within the legacy soil data. Downscaling spatially localised legacy soil data for environmental representation is an effective tool to improve digital soil mapping accuracy using MNLR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using group model building we developed a series of causal loop diagrams identifying the environmental impacts of ultra-processed food (UPF) systems, and underlying system drivers, which was subsequently validated against the peer-reviewed literature. The final conceptual model displays the commercial, biological and social drivers of the UPF system, and the impacts on environmental sub-systems including climate, land, water and waste. It displays complex interactions between various environmental impacts, demonstrating how changes to one component of the system could have flow-on effects on other components. Trade-offs and uncertainties are discussed. The model has a wide range of applications including informing the design of quantitative analyses, identifying research gaps and potential policy trade-offs resulting from a reduction of ultra-processed food production and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-unsaturated-hydraulic-conductivity-model-based-on-the-capillary-bundle-model-the-brooks-corey-model-and-waxman-smits-model&quot;&gt;An Unsaturated Hydraulic Conductivity Model Based on the Capillary Bundle Model, the Brooks-Corey Model and Waxman-Smits Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K), which depends on water content (?) and matric potential (?), exhibits a high degree of variability at the field scale. Here we first develop a theoretical hydraulic-electrical conductivity (s) relationship under low and high salinity cases based on the capillary bundle model and Waxman and Smits model which can account for the non-linear behavior of s at low salinities. Then the K-s relationship is converted into a K(?, ?) model using the Brooks-Corey model. The model includes two parameters c and ?. Parameter c accounts for the variation of the term (? + 2)/(? + 4) where ? is the pore size distribution parameter in the Brooks-Corey model, and the term m-n where m and n are Archie’s saturation and cementation exponents, respectively. Parameter ? is the sum of the tortuosity factor accounting for the differences between hydraulic and electrical tortuosity and Archie’s saturation exponent. Based on a calibration data set of 150 soils selected from the UNSODA database, the best fitting log(c) and ? values were determined as -2.53 and 1.92, -4.39 and -0.14, -5.01 and -1.34, and -5.79 and -2.27 for four textural groups. The estimated log(10)(K) values with the new K(?, ?) model compared well to the measured values from an independent data set of 49 soils selected from the UNSODA database, with mean error (ME), relative error (RE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.02, 8.8%, 0.80 and 0.73, respectively. A second test of the new K(?, ?) model using a data set representing 23 soils reported in the literature also showed good agreement between estimated and measured log(10)(K) values with ME of -0.01, RE of 9.5%, RMSE of 0.77 and R-2 of 0.85. The new K(?, ?) model outperformed the Mualem-van Genuchten model and two recently published pedo-transfer functions. The new K(?, ?) model can be applied for estimating K under field conditions and for hydrologic modeling without need for soil water retention curve data fitting to derive a K function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-landslide-susceptibility-over-large-regions-with-limited-data&quot;&gt;Mapping Landslide Susceptibility Over Large Regions With Limited Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landslide susceptibility maps indicate the spatial distribution of landslide likelihood. Modeling susceptibility over large or diverse terrains remains a challenge due to the sparsity of landslide data (mapped extent of known landslides) and the variability in triggering conditions. Several different data sampling strategies of landslide locations used to train a susceptibility model are used to mitigate this challenge. However, to our knowledge, no study has systematically evaluated how different sampling strategies alter a model’s predictor effects (i.e., how a predictor value influences the susceptibility output) critical to explaining differences in model outputs. Here, we introduce a statistical framework that examines the variation in predictor effects and the model accuracy (measured using receiver operator characteristics) to highlight why certain sampling strategies are more effective than others. Specifically, we apply our framework to an array of logistic regression models trained on landslide inventories collected at sub-regional scales over four terrains across the United States. Results show significant variations in predictor effects depending on the inventory used to train the models. The inconsistent predictor effects cause low accuracies when testing models on inventories outside the domain of the training data. Grouping test and training sets according to physiographic and ecological characteristics, which are thought to share similar triggering mechanisms, does not improve model accuracy. We also show that using limited landslide data distributed uniformly over the entire modeling domain is better than using dense but spatially isolated data to train a model for applications over large regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deterioration of soil health (SH) in agricultural lands is a global challenge that poses a threat to food and resource security. We developed a practical framework to facilitate the large-scale SH assessment in agricultural fields of northwestern Iran. A total of 350 soil samples were collected and soil properties were determined. Eight linear and non-linear Soil Health Indexes (SHIs) were developed. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and multiple remote sensing indexes were obtained from satellite images. SHI prediction models were developed using an integrated approach and through a model selection procedure, the most relevant indexes were identified. The results showed significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) positive correlation between the IHI-LT and elevation (r = 0.56), Vegetation Health Index (VHI) (r = 0.69), and Surface Water Condition Index (SWCI) (r = 0.79). The multiple regression model including the above indexes strongly explained the spatial variability of the Integrated Soil Health Index (IHI) with both total (LT) and minimum (LM) dataset approaches (R2 = 0.72; AIC =-1607.27; RMSE = 0.03; rho c = 0.65). The developed models can be utilized for large-scale assessment of soil health conditions, reducing the cost and effort of conventional ground-truth soil sampling and analysis. Furthermore, this approach may aid in monitoring and mitigating the soil degradation in agricultural lands.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Complex systems modelling of UK winter wheat yield&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twenty-four years of contrasting cropping systems on a brown chernozem in Southern Alberta: crop yields, soil carbon, and subsoil salinity&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twenty-four-years-of-contrasting-cropping-systems-on-a-brown-chernozem-in-southern-alberta-crop-yields-soil-carbon-and-subsoil-salinity&quot;&gt;Twenty-four years of contrasting cropping systems on a brown chernozem in Southern Alberta: crop yields, soil carbon, and subsoil salinity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cropping systems with perennial forages and reduced fallow frequency generally increase soil organic carbon and thus sub-sequent soil health and crop yield. We evaluated the impact of prior cropping systems on subsequent yields and soil properties in a semiarid region by using crop yields as a bioassay of soil health following the termination of a 24-year crop rotation study in the Brown soil zone in Alberta. During 24 growing seasons from 1992 to 2015, the study included three fallow-containing rotations, two annual crop rotations that were cropped continuously, and perennial grass hay, each with two to six fertilizer treatments. During the bioassay period from 2016 through 2020, all plots in the study were uniformly cropped. Compared to unfertilized fallow wheat, soil organic C in the fall of 2015 was 54% higher after 24 years of fertilized grass and up to 14% higher following annual crops in rotations without fallow. The most notable impact of the previous cropping system on yield during the bioassay years was low yield following perennial grass in 2016 and 2018. Soil electrical conductivity measurements showed that subsoil salinity was elevated following perennial grass, demonstrating the importance of subsoil characteristics for healthy soils. Crop yields in the fifth year of the crop bioassay were 10%-20% greater due to reduced fallow frequency or increased crop diversity. The long-term impact of the cropping system on crop yield in this study depended on drought intensity due to counteracting changes in soil organic matter and subsoil salinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complex-systems-modelling-of-uk-winter-wheat-yield&quot;&gt;Complex systems modelling of UK winter wheat yield&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wheat is one of the most important global crops, understanding the drivers of wheat yield has significant societal benefits. Climate variables are particularly important in determining interannual variations in wheat yield, either as primary factors which directly influence the stages of wheat growth, or as secondary factors through their influence on pests, diseases and soil conditions. Here we present a new approach to model wheat yield; an empirical method based on nonlinear complex systems identification, known as NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs model). We deploy the NARMAX analytical approach for a specific site, Rothamsted, UK, where detailed meteorological variables are available, together with specific information on site conditions and crop growth stages. NARMAX yield forecasts are compared with those from the WOFOST crop model and nine state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models; experimental results show that NARMAX outperforms all the compared methods in both prediction accuracy and model interpretability. We also develop regional wheat yield forecasts derived from a new gridded meteorological data product. The NARMAX approach produces skillful forecasts (r = 0.78) of Rothamsted wheat yield for a validation period, with small errors. The NARMAX regional forecasts, based on less specific information than WOFOST, also show a high degree of skill (r = 0.73). In addition, the predictor terms chosen for the model are identifiable and can help to give insight into potential key processes involved in the determination of wheat yield at a specific location. This approach can be extended in principle to other crop types and locations. It is straightforward and inexpensive to implement, using a limited number of meteorological predictor variables, which can be taken from site-based observations, or from gridded meteorological datasets. The method is a new tool to understand the environmental drivers of wheat yields on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;What is wrong with biofortification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-wrong-with-biofortification&quot;&gt;What is wrong with biofortification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malnutrition is now the leading avoidable cause of death and disability in the world. One aspect of malnutrition is hidden hunger, a lack of micronutrients in the diet resulting in poor health that may not manifest for months or years. One form of so-called biofortification - breeding staple crops to contain higher levels of vitamins and minerals - has received much praise as a potential solution and more than $500 million in funding over the past two decades. We show that biofortification has not delivered on its promises and that an associated yield penalty means that it may never be able to. It is likely that investment in biofortification has starved more difficult, although ultimately more sustainable, efforts to improve the overall quality of diets. Meeting Sustainable Development Goal No. 2 will depend on a more holistic improvement of culturally acceptable diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;countrywide-mapping-and-assessment-of-organic-carbon-saturation-in-the-topsoil-using-machine-learning-based-pedotransfer-function-with-uncertainty-propagation&quot;&gt;Countrywide mapping and assessment of organic carbon saturation in the topsoil using machine learning-based pedotransfer function with uncertainty propagation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders and policymakers have been becoming more and more interested not just in the potential organic carbon (SOC) saturation level of soils but also in spatially explicit information on the degree of SOC deficit, which can support future policy and sustainable management strategies, and carbon sequestration-associated spatial planning. Thus the objective of our study was to develop a cubist-based pedotransfer function (PTF) for pre-dicting and mapping the saturated SOC content of the topsoils (0-30 cm) in Hungary and then compare the resulting map with the actual SOC map to determine and assess the degree of SOC deficit. It was assumed that topsoils covered by permanent forests can be practically considered as saturated in SOC. Using the monitoring points of the Hungarian Soil Information and Monitoring System located in forests as reference soil profiles, we developed a cubist-based PTF. The transparent model structure provided by cubist allowed to show that not just the physicochemical properties of soils (e.g., texture, and pH) but also environmental conditions, such as topography (e.g., slope, altitude, and topographical position) and climate (e.g., long-term mean annual tem-perature, and evaporation), characterizing landscape are important factors in predicting the level of SOC satu-ration. Our results also pointed out that there is SOC deficit on large part of the country (similar to 80%) showing high spatial variability. It was also revealed that the most considerable potential for additional SOC sequestration can be found related to soils with medium to high actual SOC content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrating-additional-spectroscopically-inferred-soil-data-improves-the-accuracy-of-digital-soil-mapping&quot;&gt;Integrating additional spectroscopically inferred soil data improves the accuracy of digital soil mapping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital soil mapping has been increasingly advocated as an efficient approach to deliver fine-resolution and up-to-date soil information in evaluating soil ecosystem services. Considering the great spatial heterogeneity of soils, it is widely recognized that more representative soil observations are needed for better capturing the soil spatial variation and thus to increase the accuracy of digital soil maps. In reality, the budget for the field work and soil laboratory analysis is commonly limited due to its high cost and low efficiency. In the last two decades, being an alternative to wet chemistry, soil spectroscopy, such as visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR), mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy has been developed in measuring soil information in a rapid and cost-effective manner and thus enable to collect more soil information for digital soil mapping (DSM). However, spectroscopically inferred (SI) data are subject to higher uncertainties than reference laboratory analysis. Many DSM practices integrated SI data with soil observations into spatial modelling while few studies addressed the key question that whether these non-errorless soil data improve map accuracy in DSM. In this study, French Soil Monitoring Network (RMQS) and Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey Soil (LUCAS Soil) datasets were used to evaluate the potential of SI data from Vis-NIR and MIR in digital mapping of soil properties (i.e. soil organic carbon, clay, and pH) at a national scale. Cubist and quantile regression forests were used for spectral predictive modelling and DSM modelling, respectively. For both RMQS and LUCAS Soil dataset, different scenarios regarding varying proportions of SI data and laboratory observations were tested for spectral predictive models and DSM models. Repeated (50 times) external validation suggested that adding additional SI data can improve the performance of DSM models regardless of soil properties (gain of R2 proportion at 3-19%) when the laboratory observations are limited (&amp;lt;= 50%). Lower proportion of SI data used in DSM model and higher accuracy of spectral predictive models led to greater improvement of DSM. Our results also showed that a greater proportion of SI data lowered the prediction intervals which may result in an underestimation of prediction uncertainty. The determination of accuracy threshold on SI data for the use in DSM needs to be explored in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structure-liming-reduces-draught-requirement-on-clay-soil&quot;&gt;Structure liming reduces draught requirement on clay soil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liming with ‘structure lime’, comprising approximately 80-85% ground limestone and 15-20% slaked lime, has been promoted in subsidised environmental schemes in Sweden since 2010 to increase clay aggregate stability and mitigate particulate phosphorus losses to surface waters. To date, approximately 65,000 ha have been structure-limed. Apart from stabilising aggregates, liming may also improve other physical properties, such as soil strength. This study examined the effect of increasing application rate (0-16 t ha-1) of structure lime on soil strength, approximated by horizontal (draught requirement) and vertical (penetrometer resistance) measure-ments, in eight field soils (clay content 26-38%) to which structure lime had been applied two, three, four or six years previously. Draught requirement when cultivating with a multipurpose cultivator significantly decreased (by 11%) with the highest application rate of structure lime (16 t ha-1) compared with an unlimed control. This reduced the wheel power requirement by 7.1 kW and diesel consumption by 1.2-1.4 L ha-1, and lowered CO2 emissions by 3-4 kg ha-1. To clarify the general effect of structure liming, the mean value of all limed treatments was compared with that of the unlimed control. This showed that structure liming in general significantly reduced the draught requirement (by 7%). However, penetrometer resistance measurements revealed no sig-nificant effects of structure liming and no relation between draught requirement and penetrometer resistance measurements. Overall, the results indicate that structure liming can reduce fuel consumption, due to easier soil tillage, and thus lower CO2 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dual-nature-of-soil-structure-the-unity-of-aggregates-and-pores&quot;&gt;Dual nature of soil structure: The unity of aggregates and pores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil is a hierarchical, self-organizing, and emergent system that supports plant and microbial growth, enables carbon sequestration, facilitates water fluxes, and provide habitat for microorganisms, all of which depend on soil structure. Recent debates have generally reduced soil functioning to geometry and topology of soil solids and pores and denied the existence and role of soil aggregates and hierarchy of solids. Here we argue that soil structure has a dual nature that essentially boils down to the interlocking of pores and solids in groupings of specific complexity and dynamics called aggregates. By comparing their architectural, chemical, and energetic parameters, we conclude that aggregates have a much higher information density than pores. Therefore, aggregates (as unity of solids and pores) perform much broader range of functions compared to pores alone, especially in long-term. A set of soil functions corresponding to each level of the soil structure hierarchy depends on aggregate type (macroaggregates, water-stable aggregates, microaggregates, and elementary soil particles) determined by their specific binding energy, dynamics, and lifetime. The introduced here energy-based concept justifies the hierarchy of soil structure, and is the base for the soil structuring and carbon stabilization processes in their most general form. We understand the soil structure implying the energy-based approach: each hierarchy level corresponds to specific bonding strength of mineral and organic particles forming aggregates. Aggregate formation is a bottom-up process because the energy binding elementary soil particles and microaggregates is orders of magnitude higher than that gluing macroaggregates. The duality of soil structure is manifested not only in the relationship between pores and solids in aggregates, but also in the interactions and competition between the biological and non-biological processes that aggregate and disaggregate the structure. The view of the pore space as a transport pathway and habitat for soil living phase and plant roots, the solid-pore interface as a setting for physico-chemical and biological transformations, and aggregates as a result of these phenomena, provides a context for mechanistic understanding and process-based modeling of soil functions and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-field-evaluation-of-the-soilvue10-soil-moisture-sensor&quot;&gt;A field evaluation of the SoilVUE10 soil moisture sensor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) has been engaged in ground-based soil water and soil temperature observations since 2009. As a nationwide climate network, the network stations are distributed across vast complex terrains. Due to the expansive distribution of the network and the related variability in soil properties, obtaining site-specific calibrations for sensors is a significant and costly endeavor. Presented here are three commercial-grade electromagnetic sensors, with built-in thermistors to measure both soil water and soil temperature, including the SoilVUE10 Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probe (hereafter called SP) (Campbell Scientific, Inc.), 50 MHz coaxial impedance dielectric sensor (model HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring Systems, Inc.) (hereafter called HP), and the TDR-315L Probe (model TDR-315L, Acclima, Inc.) (hereafter called AP), which were evaluated in a relatively nonconductive loam soil in Oak Ridge, TN, from 2021 to 2022. The HP manufacturer-supplied calibration equation for loam soils was used in this study. While volumetric water content data from HP and AP were 82-99% of respective gravimetric observations at 10 cm, data from SP were only 65-81% of respective gravimetric observations in the top 20-cm soil horizon, where soil water showed relatively large spatial variability. The poor performance of the SP is likely due to poor contact between SP sensor electrodes and soil and the presence of soil voids caused by the installation method used, which itself may have caused soil disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upscaling-soil-moisture-from-point-scale-to-field-scale-toward-a-general-model&quot;&gt;Upscaling soil moisture from point scale to field scale: Toward a general model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Field-scale soil moisture measurements are valuable but rarely available because the resolution of most satellite soil moisture products is too coarse, while most in situ sensors provide only point-scale data. Previous upscaling approaches for such data are mostly site-specific, and none are suitable to upscale data from the thousands of stations in existing monitoring networks. To help fill this gap, this research aims to develop a more broadly applicable upscaling approach using data from the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed and a cosmic-ray neutron rover. Rover survey data were used to measure average soil moisture for the similar to 64-ha field on 12 dates in 2019-2020. Statistical modeling was used to identify the soil, terrain, and vegetation properties influencing the relationships between the field-scale rover data and point-scale in situ data from six monitoring sites. Site-specific linear upscaling models estimated the field average soil moisture with root mean squared error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.007 to 0.017 cm(3) cm(-3), but such models are not transferrable between sites. To create a more general model, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression was used with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach to identify the key predictors for upscaling. The resulting parsimonious model required only the point-scale observations and sand content data and achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.006 to 0.031 cm(3) cm(-3) for the six monitoring sites. The texture-based model demonstrated reasonable accuracy and is a promising step toward a general model that could be broadly applied for upscaling point-scale in situ monitoring stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-lime-requirements-for-tropical-soils-model-comparison-and-development&quot;&gt;Estimating lime requirements for tropical soils: Model comparison and development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acid tropical soils may become more productive when treated with agricultural lime, but optimal lime rates have yet to be determined in many tropical regions. In these regions, lime rates can be estimated with lime requirement models based on widely available soil data. We reviewed seven of these models and introduced a new model (LiTAS). We evaluated the models’ ability to predict the amount of lime needed to reach a target change in soil chemical properties with data from four soil incubation studies covering 31 soil types. Two foundational models, one targeting acidity saturation and the other targeting base saturation, were more accurate than the five models that were derived from them, while the LiTAS model was the most accurate. The models were used to estimate lime requirements for 303 African soil samples. We found large differences in the estimated lime rates depending on the target soil chemical property of the model. Therefore, an important first step in formulating liming recommendations is to clearly identify the soil property of interest and the target value that needs to be reached. While the LiTAS model can be useful for strategic research, more information on acidity-related problems other than aluminum toxicity is needed to comprehensively assess the benefits of liming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revisiting-laboratory-methods-for-measuring-soil-water-retention-curves&quot;&gt;Revisiting laboratory methods for measuring soil water retention curves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional laboratory methods for measuring soil water retention curves (SWRCs) typically consist of suction tables, pressure cells, and pressure plate apparatus (i.e., traditional methods). However, technological advancement has resulted in newer methods based on precision mini-tensiometers and dew point water potential meters (i.e., modern methods). This study investigated the discrepancy between SWRCs measured using traditional and modern methods in three soil textures. Our results showed that SWRCs from both traditional and modern methods were similar at the wet end (i.e., matric potentials 0 to -10 kPa) and at the dry end (-500 to -1,500 kPa) of the SWRC, with an average mean absolute difference (MAD) across all three soils of 0.033 and 0.017 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The largest discrepancy between methods was consistently observed at moderate tensions of -33 and -70 kPa for the three soils, with an average MAD of 0.059 cm(3) cm(-3) for -33 kPa and a MAD of 0.083 cm(3) cm(-3) for -70 kPa. Plant available water capacity differed by up to 20% between the traditional and modern methods in a clay loam soil. While previous studies have mostly focused on the dry end of the SWRC, our study suggests that additional research comparing traditional and modern methods is required at moderate (-70 and -500 kPa) tension levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-identified-agronomic-interpretation-for-potassium-permanganate-oxidizable-carbon&quot;&gt;An identified agronomic interpretation for potassium permanganate oxidizable carbon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of clear empirical relationships between soil health and agronomic outcomes remains an obstacle to widespread adoption of soil health assessments in row crop systems. The objectives of this research were to (1) determine whether soil health indicators are connected to corn (Zea mays L.) productivity and (2) establish interpretive benchmarks for soil health indicators in Missouri. The objectives were accomplished by collecting corn grain yield at 446 monitoring sites (37 m(2)) in 84 commercial production fields in 2018-2020. Soil health and soil fertility samples were collected prior to planting at each site. These data, along with site-specific soil and weather data, were modeled using traditional stepwise regression and nonparametric random forest (RF) and conditional inference forest (CIF) approaches. Root-mean-square errors were similar (1.4-1.5 Mg ha(-1)) with distinct R-2 improvements over stepwise regression for both CIF (R-2 = 0.45) and RF (R-2 = 0.46) algorithms. Only seasonal rainfall and potassium permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) were included as top factors governing grain productivity in each model approach, thus demonstrating a regionally robust empirical relationship between POXC and grain productivity. Partial dependency analysis and two decision tree approaches identified 415 mg POXC kg(-1) as a threshold for maximum grain productivity, providing a framework for regional interpretation of on-farm soil health assessments. Little evidence was found connecting grain productivity with autoclaved citrate extractable protein and soil respiration. These findings underscore the power of POXC as an emerging soil health indicator to assess and quantify soil management effects on grain productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-simple-method-to-determine-the-reactivity-of-calcium-carbonate-in-soils&quot;&gt;A simple method to determine the reactivity of calcium carbonate in soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determination of soil carbonate is important for numerous chemical and physical soil processes in arid and semi-arid zones. Here, we modify a conventional method to more easily determine active CaCO3 (ACC) fraction in soils. Unlike the conventional method where the oxalate used up after reaction with carbonate is determined by titration with KMnO4, the proposed method uses the difference between total carbonate analyzed before and after reaction with oxalate to determine ACC. The method compared well to the conventional approach; the procedure was faster, did not require KMnO4, and appeared to be unaffected by exchangeable Ca. The proposed method is well-suited for samples across a wide range of total carbonate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-multivariate-approach-for-mapping-a-soil-quality-index-and-its-uncertainty-in-southern-france&quot;&gt;A multivariate approach for mapping a soil quality index and its uncertainty in southern France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedometricians have spent a lot of effort on mapping soil types and basic soil properties. However, end-users typically need a more elaborate soil quality index for land management. Soil quality indices are typically derived from multiple individual soil properties by evaluating whether specific criteria are met. If this is based on individually mapped soil properties, then an important consequence is that cross-correlations between soil properties are ignored. This makes it impossible to quantify the uncertainties associated with the mapped indices. The objective of this study was to map a soil potential multifunctionality index for agriculture (Agri-SPMI) over a 12,125 km(2) study region located along the French Mediterranean coast to help urban planners preserve soils of the highest quality. The index considered the ability of soils to fulfil four functions under five land use scenarios. A binary map represented each soil function fulfilment for a given scenario. The final soil quality index map was the sum of the 20 binary maps. A regression cokriging model was developed to map the basic soil properties first individually from legacy soil data and spatial soil covariates using a random forest algorithm, and next, interpolate the residuals using cokriging and the linear model of coregionalisation. The mapping uncertainties of soil properties were propagated by calculating the soil quality index over 300 stochastic simulations of soil properties derived from the linear models of coregionalisation. Results showed a poor prediction accuracy of the quality index, mainly because some soil properties were poorly predicted (notably available water capacity and coarse fragments) and used in combination with extreme thresholds that defined land suitability. Overall, the uncertainty was correctly quantified because the stochastic simulations reproduced the width of the observed distribution well, but the shapes of the distributions differed considerably from those of the observations. We envisage some ways for improvement, such as creating probability maps instead of the mean from simulations, and changing the prediction support from point to area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-large-scale-soil-moisture-monitoring-using-rail-based-cosmic-ray-neutron-sensing&quot;&gt;Toward Large-Scale Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Rail-Based Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil water content (SWC) monitoring. Stationary CRNS offers hectare-scale average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance-free and continuous in time, while car-borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail-borne system as the first of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an similar to 9 km railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train, supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric methods), car-borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail-borne CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC monitoring for larger scales (&amp;lt;= 10-km), with the additional benefit of providing root-zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub-daily resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-novel-physics-aware-machine-learning-based-dynamic-error-correction-model-for-improving-streamflow-forecast-accuracy&quot;&gt;A Novel Physics-Aware Machine Learning-Based Dynamic Error Correction Model for Improving Streamflow Forecast Accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occurrences of extreme events, especially floods, have become more frequent and severe in the recent past due to the global impacts of climate change. In this context, possibilities for generating a near-accurate streamflow forecast at higher lead times, which could be utilized for developing a reliable flood warning system to minimize the effects of extreme events, are highly important. This paper aims to investigate the potential of a novel hybrid modeling framework that couples the random forest algorithm, particle filter, and the HBV model for improving the overall accuracy of forecasts at higher lead times through the dynamic error correction schematic. The new framework simulates an ensemble of streamflow for estimating uncertainty associated with the predictions and is applied across two snow-fed Himalayan rivers: the Beas River in India and the Sunkoshi River in Nepal. Several statistical indices along with graphical performance indicators were used for assessing the accuracy of the model performance and associated uncertainty. The modeling framework achieved the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.94 and 0.98 in calibration and 0.95 and 0.99 in validation for the Beas and Sunkoshi river basin respectively for a 7-day ahead forecast. Thus, the proposed framework can be considered as a promising tool having reasonably good performance in forecasting streamflow at a higher lead time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spatially-explicit-linkages-between-redox-potential-cycles-and-soil-moisture-fluctuations&quot;&gt;Spatially Explicit Linkages Between Redox Potential Cycles and Soil Moisture Fluctuations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduction-oxidation cycles measured through soil redox potential (E-h) are associated with dynamic soil microbial activity. Understanding changes in the composition of, and resource use by, soil microbial communities requires E-h predictability under shifting hydrologic drivers. Here, 50-cm soil column installations are manipulated to vary hydrologic and geochemical conditions, and are extensively monitored by a dense instrumental deployment to record the depth-time variation of physical and biogeochemical conditions. We contrast measurements of E-h, soil saturation and key compounds in water samples (probing the majority of soil microbial metabolisms) with computations of the relevant state variables, to investigate the interplay between soil moisture and redox potential dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of joint spatially resolved hydrologic flow/transport and redox processes, the worth of contrasting experiments and computations for a sufficient understanding of the E-h dynamics, and the minimum amount of biogeochemistry needed to characterize the dynamics of electron donors/acceptors that are responsible for the patterns of E-h not directly explained by physical oxic/anoxic transitions. As an example, measured concentrations of sulfate, ammonium and iron II suggest coexistence of both oxic and anoxic conditions. We find that the local saturation velocity (a threshold value of the time derivative of soil saturation) exerts a significant hysteretic control on oxygen intrusion and on the cycling of redox potentials, in contrast with approaches using a single threshold saturation level as the determinant of anoxic conditions. Our findings improve our ability to target how and where hotspots of activity develop within soil microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-warming-from-global-food-consumption&quot;&gt;Future warming from global food consumption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food consumption is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and evaluating its future warming impact is crucial for guiding climate mitigation action. However, the lack of granularity in reporting food item emissions and the widespread use of oversimplified metrics such as CO2 equivalents have complicated interpretation. We resolve these challenges by developing a global food consumption GHG emissions inventory separated by individual gas species and employing a reduced-complexity climate model, evaluating the associated future warming contribution and potential benefits from certain mitigation measures. We find that global food consumption alone could add nearly 1 degrees C to warming by 2100. Seventy five percent of this warming is driven by foods that are high sources of methane (ruminant meat, dairy and rice). However, over 55% of anticipated warming can be avoided from simultaneous improvements to production practices, the universal adoption of a healthy diet and consumer- and retail-level food waste reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the role of the human diet in climate change has been widely acknowledged, current practices fail to capture its realistic effect on warming. In this Analysis, Ivanovich et al. develop a global food consumption emission inventory and estimate the associated future climate impact using a reduced-complexity climate model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods-for-reducing-the-tillage-force-of-subsoiling-tools-a-review&quot;&gt;Methods for reducing the tillage force of subsoiling tools: A review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation tillage technology (CTT) is a promising and efficient method for farmland protection and utiliza-tion. As one of the core technologies of CTT, mechanical subsoiling has been identified as an effective practice to disrupt hardpans and reduce soil bulk density to promote better water infiltration and crop root development. The tillage force during subsoiling (TFDS) is extremely high and methods for reducing the TFDS have been developed. A comprehensive summary about typical subsoiling tools and corresponding tool characteristics and current methods for TFDS reduction were reported in this review. The TFDS reduction methods were introduced in five aspects: biomimetic, oscillatory, lubrication, experimental, and others (i.e., line element design, layered subsoiling, crop straw and root anti-blocking, high-pressure gas splitting, rotary subsoiling, and selection of working depth and time). The mechanisms and limitations of current methods were analysed. The effect of various methods on draught forces of subsoiling tools with similar working parameters were quantitatively investigated and compared using statistical analyses. This review also recommends four future research di-rections about further reduction of TFDS to promote the development of TFDS reduction technology and CTT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interpreting-ramped-combustion-thermograms-using-13c-nmr-spectroscopy-to-characterize-soil-organic-matter-composition&quot;&gt;Interpreting ramped combustion thermograms using 13C NMR spectroscopy to characterize soil organic matter composition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many advanced analytical methods have been applied to soil organic matter (SOM), its highly complex and heterogeneous chemical composition still eludes complete characterization. Analytical thermal analysis has been proposed as a relatively rapid, inexpensive method for SOM characterization that requires no pre-treatment, but is challenging due to a lack of direct information about chemical composition. The goal of this study was to inform the interpretation of coupled differential scanning calorimetry and evolved gas analyses (DSC, CO2-EGA) using spectral correlations with solid phase 13C NMR data. We used a subset of soils collected as part of the Australian National Soil Carbon Research Program (SCaRP), which were physically fractionated and charac-terized using conventional analytical methods. Correlating the well-understood NMR spectra with the less -understood DSC and CO2-EGA thermograms provided some indications of which chemical compounds combust at which temperatures. Overall, the EGA data generated stronger correlations compared to correlations with DSC data, which was attributable to greater variability in DSC data due thermal reactions associated with minerals. Direct comparison of NMR and thermal data for the mineral associated organic matter in the fine (&amp;lt;50 mu m) fraction was not possible due to the need to demineralize samples prior to NMR analyses. Thermal analyses showed substantial differences in samples pre-and post-HF pretreatment, and the NMR data for HF treated samples showed scattered and weak correlation patterns with DSC and EGA data for untreated samples. While precise chemical compositions cannot be gleaned directly from thermal analyses results, thermal approaches provide an avenue of investigation into SOM reactivity based on bioenergetics that may be a quantitative rep-resentation of SOM persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regolith-or-soil-an-ongoing-debate&quot;&gt;Regolith or soil? An ongoing debate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitions of soil and regolith abound, the traditional view seeing soil as the top part of the regolith. Leighton (1958) claimed that soil and regolith are the same thing. Definitions of soil arising from research on soil and regolith in extraterrestrial, Precambrian, and some human-made settings tends to reinforce this view. Over the last two decades, the work of some researchers, including whole-regolith pedologists, has reinforced the case for Leighton’s claim, suggesting that soil and regolith are indeed the same and form pedo-weathering profiles. This view partly reflects a growing realization that the substratum plays an important role in some soil-forming processes, and should be included in soil classification schemes. The regolith-or-soil debate also applies when looking at soil in the contexts of the Earth System and the Critical Zone, both of which stress the connections between unweathered rock, weathered rock, fluid flows, and biological activity at local, regional, and global scales. It is unlikely that the debate will end: realistically, research on the whole-regolith pedological studies, including those that tackle wider links with the Earth System, will accompany pedological studies that focus on the solum and soil-forming processes within it, although they will assuredly inform each other; and, even though a case is made for regolith and soil being the same thing, it is will doubtless spark disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-many-bootstrap-replications-are-necessary-for-estimating-remote-sensing-assisted-model-based-standard-errors&quot;&gt;How many bootstrap replications are necessary for estimating remote sensing-assisted, model-based standard errors?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When probability samples are not available, the model-based framework may be the only option for constructing inferences in the form of prediction intervals for population means. Further, for machine learning and some non-parametric and nonlinear regression prediction techniques, resampling methods such as the bootstrap may be the only option for obtaining the standard errors necessary for constructing those prediction intervals.All bootstrap approaches entail repeatedly sampling from the original sample, estimating the parameter of interest for each replication, and estimating the standard error of the estimate of the parameter as the standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates over replications. The objective of the study was to develop a procedure for terminating resampling such that the resulting number of replications assures, at least in probability, that the estimate of the standard error stabilizes to the standard error corresponding to one million replications. The analyses used a variety of datasets: five forest inventory datasets with either volume or aboveground biomass as the dependent variable and metrics from either airborne laser scanning or Landsat as independent variables, three from Europe, one from Southwest Asia, and one from Africa; and two forest/non-forest versus Landsat datasets, one from Minnesota and one from Wisconsin, both in the USA. The primary contribution of the study was development and demonstration of a procedure that specifies criteria for terminating resampling that assure in probability that the bootstrap estimate of the standard error stabilizes to the estimate obtained with one million replications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;controls-on-the-presence-and-storage-of-soil-inorganic-carbon-in-a-semi-arid-watershed&quot;&gt;Controls on the presence and storage of soil inorganic carbon in a semi-arid watershed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) constitutes-40-50% of the terrestrial soil carbon and is an integral part of the global carbon cycle. Rainfall is a primary factor controlling SIC accumulation; however, the distribution and hierarchy of controls on SIC development in arid and semi-arid regions is poorly understood. The Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwestern Idaho is an ideal location to study factors influencing SIC because it spans a wide mean annual precipitation range (235 mm to 900 mm) along a 1,425 to 2,111 m elevation gradient and has soils derived from a wide variety of parent materials (granite, basalt, dust, and al-luvium). We collected soil samples along this elevational gradient to understand local controls on SIC distri-butions. SIC content was quantified at 71 soil pits and/or augered cores collected between approximately 0-1 m depth or until refusal. Consistent with previous studies, we found variations in precipitation governed the presence or absence of SIC; field measurements of the top 1 m of soils confirm little or no SIC in soils receiving &amp;gt; 500 mm in mean annual precipitation. Below this 500 mm threshold, SIC pools varied substantially and significantly between sites. Results showed that 90% of sites (64 sites) contained less than 10 kg m- 2 SIC, 7% (5 sites) contained 10-20 kg m- 2, and 3% (2 sites) contain between 24 and 29 kg m- 2 SIC. The total SIC within RCEW was estimated at-5.17 x 105 Mg. After precipitation, slope consistently ranked as the second most important predictor of SIC accumulation in random forest analysis. Wind-blown dust likely contributed to SIC accumulation; prior work indicates an average dust flux rate in RCEW of about 11 +/- 4.9 g m- 2 year -1. This study provides an initial model predicting SIC distribution and accumulation in a shrub-dominated dryland watershed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;environmental-microbiome-engineering-for-the-mitigation-of-climate-change&quot;&gt;Environmental microbiome engineering for the mitigation of climate change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental microbiome engineering is emerging as a potential avenue for climate change mitigation. In this process, microbial inocula are introduced to natural microbial communities to tune activities that regulate the long-term stabilization of carbon in ecosystems. In this review, we outline the process of environmental engineering and synthesize key considerations about ecosystem functions to target, means of sourcing microorganisms, strategies for designing microbial inocula, methods to deliver inocula, and the factors that enable inocula to establish within a resident community and modify an ecosystem function target. Recent work, enabled by high-throughput technologies and modeling approaches, indicate that microbial inocula designed from the top-down, particularly through directed evolution, may generally have a higher chance of establishing within existing microbial communities than other historical approaches to microbiome engineering. We address outstanding questions about the determinants of inocula establishment and provide suggestions for further research about the possibilities and challenges of environmental microbiome engineering as a tool to combat climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-based-explainable-ai-and-its-application-for-remote-sensing-image-classification&quot;&gt;Example-based explainable AI and its application for remote sensing image classification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present a method of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), “What I Know (WIK)”, to provide additional information to verify the reliability of a deep learning model by showing an example of an instance in a training dataset that is similar to the input data to be inferred and demonstrate it in a remote sensing image classification task. One of the expected roles of XAI methods is verifying whether inferences of a trained machine learning model are valid for an application, and it is an important factor that what datasets are used for training the model as well as the model architecture. Our data-centric approach can help determine whether the training dataset is sufficient for each inference by checking the selected example data. If the selected example looks similar to the input data, we can confirm that the model was not trained on a dataset with a feature distribution far from the feature of the input data. With this method, the criteria for selecting an example are not merely data similarity with the input data but also data similarity in the context of the model task. Using a remote sensing image dataset from the Sentinel-2 satellite, the concept was successfully demonstrated with reasonably selected examples. This method can be applied to various machine-learning tasks, including classification and regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-of-artificial-step-pools-in-natural-hazard-mitigation&quot;&gt;Application of artificial step-pools in natural hazard mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The step-pool is a representative riverbed structure that is highly effective in increasing flow resistance and dissipating flow energy. Well-designed artificial step-pools can control channel incision, improve riverbed sta-bility, and further mitigate natural hazards. In this study, step-pools following the characteristics of natural step -pools in terms of their geomorphology and energy dissipation are designed and applied to mitigate channel incision and debris flow, in a small watershed where riverbed structures are poorly developed and landslides and massive debris flow have occurred frequently as a result of channel incision. The jamming ratio of the step-pools is mostly less than 6.0, and the SP values, i.e., the development degree of riverbed are over 0.1, and these values are increased significantly compared with the original values, guaranteeing the stability of the constructed steps. Field investigation indicated that the artificial step-pools experienced little adjustment and generally remained stable during the flood season. The constructed steps caused a decreasing trend in deposition downstream, and achieved the expected effects in natural hazard mitigation effects by reducing and transferring the debris flows to hyper-concentrated flows and eventually to normal flood flows. Therefore, the stable step-pools effectively suppressed massive sediment movements, with 69.3% of the loose sediment eroded from the water erosion zone being trapped in the step-pool reach, which promoted uplift of the channel bed. Numerical simulation of debris flows reveals that the maximum kinetic energy of debris flow was reduced by about 27 % with the artificial step -pools compared to the pre-construction condition. The scientific findings and practical applications concerning the use of artificial step-pools could provide guidance for natural hazard mitigation in mountainous areas at the small watershed scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognition-of-potential-outliers-in-soil-datasets-from-the-perspective-of-geographical-context-for-improving-farm-level-soil-mapping-accuracies&quot;&gt;Recognition of potential outliers in soil datasets from the perspective of geographical context for improving farm-level soil mapping accuracies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil datasets with outliers lead to inaccurate farm-level digital soil mapping (DSM) results. Existing methods identify potential outliers in soil datasets based on expert experience or simple statistics that neglect the geographical characteristics of soil. In this paper, a novel potential outlier recognition method was developed from the perspective of geographical context. First, spatial search distance was automatically determined by the spatial distance among soil samples. Second, similarities of adjacent soil samples and the local spatial variation level were comprehensively considered to calculate outlier scores. Finally, a frequency histogram of outlier scores was generated to determine a suitable threshold for recognizing potential abnormal samples. To validate the proposed method, it was compared to Lambda and Box-Plot methods, and the ordinary kriging method was used to map five soil properties, including pH, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium, in an agricultural region. Then, a synthetic study using artificially contaminated DEM data was also conducted. The comparative experiment shows that the proposed method is better able to recognize potential outliers by mining the local spatial structure, as indicated by lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values. It can be concluded that consideration of local spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity is helpful in recognizing potential outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-rill-soil-erosion-in-agricultural-fields-with-uav-borne-remote-sensing-data&quot;&gt;Mapping rill soil erosion in agricultural fields with UAV-borne remote sensing data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil erosion by water is a main form of land degradation worldwide. The problem has been addressed, among others, in the United Nations Sustainability Goals. However, for mitigation of erosion consequences and adequate management of affected areas, reliable information on the magnitude and spatial patterns of erosion is needed. Although such need is often addressed by erosion modelling, precise erosion monitoring is necessary for the calibration and validation of erosion models and to study erosion patterns in landscapes. Conventional methods for quantification of rill erosion are based on labour-intensive field measurements. In contrast, remote sensing techniques promise fast, non-invasive, systematic and larger-scale surveying. Thus, the main objective of this study was to develop and evaluate automated and transferable methodologies for mapping the spatial extent of erosion rills from a single acquisition of remote sensing data. Data collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle was used to deliver a highly detailed digital elevation model (DEM) of the analysed area. Rills were classified by two methods with different settings. One approach was based on a series of decision rules applied on DEM-derived geomorphological terrain attributes. The second approach utilized the random forest machine learning algorithm. The methods were tested on three agricultural fields representing different erosion patterns and vegetation covers. Our study showed that the proposed methods can ensure recognition of rills with accuracies between 80 and 90% depending on rill characteristics. In some cases, however, the methods were sensitive to very small rill incisions and to similar geometry of rills to other features. Additionally, their performance was influenced by the vegetation structure and cover. Besides these challenges, the introduced approach was capable of mapping rills fully automatically at the field scale and can, therefore, support a fast and flexible assessment of erosion magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimizing-nitrogen-fertilizer-application-to-improve-nitrogen-use-efficiency-and-grain-yield-of-rainfed-spring-maize-under-ridge-furrow-plastic-film-mulching-planting&quot;&gt;Optimizing nitrogen fertilizer application to improve nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield of rainfed spring maize under ridge-furrow plastic film mulching planting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efficient nitrogen (N) fertilizer management strategies are integral components of rational farmland cropping systems. Ridge-furrow plastic film mulching (RFPM) is a widely used micro-catchment planting system in the rain-fed farming area of the Loess Plateau in China, there are still problems of excessive N fertilizer application and unreasonable application method under this system. In this study, we conducted a two-year field experiment with traditional flat planting (FP) as a control, to determine the effect of N application rate (180 kg ha–1, 240 kg ha–1, and 300 kg ha–1) on soil nitrate N, total N, grain yield and N fertilizer partial factor productivity (NFPF) of spring maize under RFPM with three ridge–furrow ratios (RF40–70 = 40 cm:70 cm; RF55–55 = 55 cm:55 cm; RF70–40 = 70 cm:40 cm). In addition, under N application rate of 240 kg ha−1, a micro-plot experiment was conducted to determine the fate of fertilizer N by applying N15-labeled urea on ridges and in furrows under RFPM, respectively. The results showed that compared with flat planting (FP), RFPM reduced the residue of NO3–-N (0–200 cm soil layer) and accumulation total N (0–100 cm soil layer) in the soil under three N application rates, especially under RF70–40. Reducing the N application rate decreased the accumulation of NO3–-N and total N under each ridge-furrow ratio. Compared with FP, RFPM increased the N accumulation, grain yield, NFPF for spring maize under all three N application rates. However, the N harvest index decreased as the N application rate increased under RFPM, thereby suggesting that the targeted N production could be improved for plants by optimizing the N application rate. By balancing the grain yield and NFPF, the optimal N application rates under FP, RF40–70, RF55–55, and RF70–40 were determined as 223 kg ha–1, 204 kg ha–1, 228 kg ha–1, and 207 kg ha–1, respectively, and these results also suggest that RFPM can lower the N input threshold compared with FP. In addition, N isotope tracing was used to clarify the fate of fertilizer N under RFPM, which showed that the contribution of fertilizer N to plants increased when N fertilizer was applied in furrows, and reduced the residual proportion of fertilizer N in soil. Therefore, our findings suggest that N fertilizer should be applied in the furrows after forming the ridges and furrows under RFPM.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Estimating nutrient transport associated with water and wind erosion across New South Wales, Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;estimating-nutrient-transport-associated-with-water-and-wind-erosion-across-new-south-wales-australia&quot;&gt;Estimating nutrient transport associated with water and wind erosion across New South Wales, Australia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutrient transported from soils to water bodies not only threatens agricultural productivity and food security but also causes the degradation of water quality and the environment in many parts of the world. However, nutrient transport through soil erosion is often ignored in nutrient cycle studies; there is little understanding of how much nutrient is lost through water and wind erosion. In this study, we attempted to assess soil nutrient transport due to both water and wind erosion and its spatial and temporal variability across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We estimated the mass fraction (%) of total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the eroded soil, and the total nutrient stock of the soil layer down to 200 cm using water and wind erosion models and digital soil mapping. The estimated average N, P and SOC stocks in NSW topsoils (0-5 cm) are 160, 43, and 2970 kg ha(-1) respectively. There are great variations in the transport of nutrients by erosion in space and time, ranging from near zero in the Western region to 395 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the North Coast region. The average total nutrient transport rate is about 2.4 % of the surface soil (0-5 cm) total stock in NSW due to both water and wind erosion. The total cost of nutrient transport is estimated at 4.2 billion Australian dollars for the entire state of NSW and 0.2 billion dollars from the cropping lands per year. The areas with the highest nutrient transport rates are the North Coast and Hunter regions due to the relatively high water erosion and nutrient content of the soils. On average, water erosion contributes up to 98 % of the total nutrient transport across the state as a whole, but wind erosion can contribute up to 12 % of the total transport in Spring (i.e., September). This study is the first attempt to investigate nutrient transport from both water and wind erosion in Australia. The methodology and findings contribute to the knowledge of nutrient transport due to erosion in broad nutrient cycle studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-structural-vulnerability-critical-review-and-conceptual-development&quot;&gt;Soil structural vulnerability: Critical review and conceptual development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil structure affects a range of soil functions (e.g., water, air, heat, and nutrient transport) and ecosystem services (e.g., production, climate regulation). Agricultural intensification is a dominant factor in global soil structural degradation. Understanding the vulnerability of soils to structural degradation may be important to land use planning and identifying management practices that mitigate the risk of degradation. We review the current methods for assessing soil structural vulnerability and the influencing factors, focussing on soil compaction and aggregate breakdown as two key measures of structural degradation. Methods for assessing risk of soil structural degradation and management practices affecting the risk are also discussed. Critical research gaps are identified, including the lack of studies that demonstrate the link between soil structural vulnerability and loss of soil functions or ecosystem services. Our review of the literature identified that the terms suscepti-bility, vulnerability, and risk are often used interchangeably. We propose definitions that can be used to distinguish these terms. Soil properties (relatively static), soil wetness, and land use stress (e.g., climate and management practices) are progressively included in the assessments of soil structural susceptibility, vulnera-bility, and risk. Existing indicators for assessing soil structural vulnerability may not be suitable to predict po-tential effects on ecosystem services. We highlight that soil structural vulnerability assessments should focus on key soil structural indicators (e.g., pore network-based hydraulic properties) affecting soil functions and ecosystem services. Both the state (i.e., condition) of soil structure and its vulnerability should be included for assessing soil structural degradation. To overcome the limitations of previous assessments, we developed a conceptual model linking soil structural vulnerability assessment to loss of soil functions and ecosystem services. Our review provides insights on assessment metrics and frameworks to develop management practices that improve soil structure and delivery of ecosystem services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparing-the-prediction-performance-uncertainty-quantification-and-extrapolation-potential-of-regression-kriging-and-random-forest-while-accounting-for-soil-measurement-errors&quot;&gt;Comparing the prediction performance, uncertainty quantification and extrapolation potential of regression kriging and random forest while accounting for soil measurement errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geostatistics and machine learning have been extensively applied for modelling and predicting the spatial distribution of continuous soil variables. In addition to providing predictions, both techniques quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions, although geostatistics is more developed in this respect. Despite the increased use of these techniques, most algorithms ignore that the soil measurements are not error-free. Recently, concern has also arisen about the extrapolation risk of these techniques, be it in geographic space, feature space, or both. In this paper, regression kriging (RK) and random forest (RF) were compared with respect to their ability to deliver accurate predictions and quantify prediction uncertainties, while accounting for measurement errors in the soil data. The sensitivity of results of both models to soil measurement errors was also evaluated, as well as their spatial extrapolation potential. This was done for a case study in Cameroon where soil pH, clay and organic carbon were mapped from measurements obtained using both conventional and proximal soil sensing methods. The results showed that both models produced comparable ranges and maps of predicted values for the soil properties of interest. Compared to RF, RK outperformed RF by presenting generally a higher Model Efficiency Coefficient (MEC), lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values and better extrapolation performance. The improvement in RMSE was about 10, 12 and 2 % while the improvement in MEC was on average 5, 22 and 1 % for pH, clay and SOC, respectively Overestimation of the local uncertainty observed for RK was larger than that of RF as shown by accuracy plots, indicating that prediction uncertainties were better quantified by the RF model. Better extrapolation performance was obtained with RK that derived better predictions than RF at unsampled locations as shown by cross-validation metrics and scatter plots, particularly when RK and RF were used for spatial extrapolation. The effects of incorporating measurement errors were not significant both for the predictions and for the prediction uncertainties due to the fact that most calibration data had the same measurement error variance. Model comparison should go beyond common validation metrics that only evaluate prediction accuracy but must also account for the ability to quantify prediction uncertainty at unsampled locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multivariate-random-forest-for-digital-soil-mapping&quot;&gt;Multivariate random forest for digital soil mapping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In digital soil mapping (DSM), soil maps are usually produced in a univariate manner, that is, each soil map is produced independently and therefore, when multiple soil properties are mapped the underlying dependence structure between these soil properties is ignored. This may lead to inconsistent predictions and simulations. For example, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) maps produced independently may show unrealistic carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratios. In the last decade the production of soil maps with machine learning models has become increasingly popular as these models are able to capture complex non-linear relationships between soil properties and environmental covariates. However, producing soil maps with multivariate machine learning models is still lacking and requires much investigation in DSM. In this paper we present the combined modelling of multiple soil properties with a multivariate random forest (MRF) model. We applied this model to mapping SOC and TN, and we compared it with results of two separate univariate random forest (RF) models. The comparison was done by means of stochastic simulations determined by sampling from the conditional distributions of the soil properties, given the covariates, as estimated by quantile regression forest. The results show that the MRF model is superior in terms of maintaining the dependence structure between SOC and TN, and consequently, is also able to produce more realistic C:N ratios. The models were also compared on the basis of prediction accuracy using commonly used accuracy metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE). We found that the accuracy of the MRF model (RMSE-SOC = 40.04, RMSE-TN = 2.26, RMSE-CN = 3.58) is comparable to that of the univariate RF models (RMSE-SOC = 39.76, RMSE-TN = 2.26, RMSE-CN = 3.65). We performed the same comparisons between a regression co-kriging model and two separate regression kriging models, and made similar conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-soil-an-organic-carbon-sink-or-source-upon-erosion-transport-and-deposition&quot;&gt;Is soil an organic carbon sink or source upon erosion, transport and deposition?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil may be a carbon source or sink under the effect of sediment and soil organic carbon (SOC) erosion, transport and deposition. Partial SOC processes to determine whether soil subjected to water erosion is a carbon sink or source have not been clarified but are essential for increasing and predicting SOC storage. In this review, the associations between SOC mineralization, stability and stock at erosion sites, in transported sediments and at deposition sites are clarified. An overview is given for possible determination standards that define soil carbon sinks and sources. Methods for enhancing SOC sequestration and suggestions for improving SOC prediction are also presented. Particle transport is an important intermediate process that determines the material base for SOC stability and sequestration in each erosion and deposition element. When subject to water erosion, a high probability of SOC physical stabilization and a thick soil layer are essential for soil to function as a SOC sink. Sediment transport weakens SOC physical protection in eroded areas but can promote aggregation factors at deposition sites in some cases while increasing the depth of SOC in the soil. In this circumstance, a good soil environment for plant growth facilitates the occurrence of carbon sinks. A concept for critical erosion intensity is proposed to understand SOC sink determination; the concept is presented as the volume of soil erosion per square kilometre (m(3) km(-2)) for which the maximum reduction in vegetation cover or plant biomass still permits plants to provide enough organic matter to compensate for erosion-induced SOC loss. If erosion intensity is higher than critical erosion intensity at the erosion site, soil degradation is obvious, and soil is presented as an OC source, and vice versa. Finally, the SOC burial method for increasing the soil carbon storage amounts in regions with thick soil layers is presented to explore the SOC sequestration potential in deep soil. The factors considered for SOC prediction should vary with research scale. We hope our review will have direct implications for the modelling of SOC dynamics under water erosion on both slopes and at large scales. HighlightsChanges in soil texture and soil thickness greatly affect the amount of SOC storage at erosion and deposition sites.Selective transport of soil materials or chemical elements promotes soil aggregation.Possible standards that define soil carbon sinks and sources and suggestions for improving SOC prediction are presented.SOC burial may be a good method for increasing C storage amounts in regions with thick layers of fine soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the effects of radio frequency interference and the limitations of algorithms under specific conditions, most of the currently available microwave-based soil moisture (SM) products are spatially discontinuous and have coarse spatial resolution, whereas optical observations also reveal various data gaps due to cloud contamination. Hence, the prediction of SM over invalid pixels and disaggregation from coarse to high scales are two main processes for obtaining SM at fine spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., daily/1-km). In the present study, two methods with respect to disaggregation-first or prediction-first were investigated from the synergetic use of the widely recognized European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) SM product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region. Specifically, the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) algorithm and the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) were implemented in the disaggregation and prediction, respectively. In DisPATCh, spatially complete land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM) were provided as essential inputs to downscale the microwave-based ESA-CCI to a spatial resolution of 1 km, whereas MODIS-derived LST, NDVI, land surface albedo and DEM were considered in the GRNN prediction. Following the two methods, the daily/1-km SM dataset over a period of three years was finally estimated. Assessments with ground in-situ SM measurements over the TP region reveal an acceptable accuracy with unbiased root mean square errors of similar to 0.06 m3/m3, indicating the potential to obtain operational daily/1-km spatially continuous SM products in future developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-soil-nitrogen-cycle-pattern-and-nitrogen-enrichment-effects-tropical-versus-subtropical-forests&quot;&gt;Global soil nitrogen cycle pattern and nitrogen enrichment effects: Tropical versus subtropical forests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tropical and subtropical forest biomes are a main hotspot for the global nitrogen (N) cycle. Yet, our understanding of global soil N cycle patterns and drivers and their response to N deposition in these biomes remains elusive.  Dominant tree species can also influence soil N cycle pattern, which has changed from conservative in deciduous forests to leaky in coniferous forests. We provide global evidence that tropical, but not subtropical, forests are characterized by soil N dynamics sustaining N availability and that N deposition inhibits soil N retention and stimulates N losses in these biomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ecosystem-wilting-point-defines-drought-response-and-recovery-of-a-quercus-carya-forest&quot;&gt;The ecosystem wilting point defines drought response and recovery of a Quercus-Carya forest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil and atmospheric droughts increasingly threaten plant survival and productivity around the world. Yet, conceptual gaps constrain our ability to predict ecosystem-scale drought impacts under climate change. Here, we introduce the ecosystem wilting point (psi(EWP)), a property that integrates the drought response of an ecosystem’s plant community across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Specifically, psi(EWP) defines a threshold below which the capacity of the root system to extract soil water and the ability of the leaves to maintain stomatal function are strongly diminished. We combined ecosystem flux and leaf water potential measurements to derive the psi(EWP) of a Quercus-Carya forest from an “ecosystem pressure-volume (PV) curve,” which is analogous to the tissue-level technique. When community predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) was above psi(EWP) (=-2.0 MPa), the forest was highly responsive to environmental dynamics. When psi(pd) fell below psi(EWP), the forest became insensitive to environmental variation and was a net source of carbon dioxide for nearly 2 months. Thus, psi(EWP) is a threshold defining marked shifts in ecosystem functional state. Though there was rainfall-induced recovery of ecosystem gas exchange following soaking rains, a legacy of structural and physiological damage inhibited canopy photosynthetic capacity. Although over 16 growing seasons, only 10% of psi(pd) observations fell below psi(EWP), the forest is commonly only 2-4 weeks of intense drought away from reaching psi(EWP), and thus highly reliant on frequent rainfall to replenish the soil water supply. We propose, based on a bottom-up analysis of root density profiles and soil moisture characteristic curves, that soil water acquisition capacity is the major determinant of psi(EWP), and species in an ecosystem require compatible leaf-level traits such as turgor loss point so that leaf wilting is coordinated with the inability to extract further water from the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automatic-regionalization-of-model-parameters-for-hydrological-models&quot;&gt;Automatic Regionalization of Model Parameters for Hydrological Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parameter estimation is one of the most challenging tasks in large-scale distributed modeling, because of the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Relating model parameters to catchment/landscape characteristics reduces the number of parameters, enhances physical realism, and allows the transfer of hydrological model parameters in time and space. This study presents the first large-scale application of automatic parameter transfer function (TF) estimation for a complex hydrological model. The Function Space Optimization (FSO) method can automatically estimate TF structures and coefficients for distributed models. We apply FSO to the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM, mhm-ufz.og), which is the only available distributed model that includes a priori defined TFs for all its parameters. FSO is used to estimate new TFs for the parameters “saturated hydraulic conductivity “ and “field capacity, “ which both influence a range of hydrological processes. The setup of mHM from a previous study serves as a benchmark. The estimated TFs resulted in predictions in 222 validation basins with a median NSE of 0.68, showing that even with 5 years of calibration data, high performance in ungauged basins can be achieved. The performance is similar to the benchmark results, showing that the automatic TFs can achieve comparable results to TFs that were developed over years using expert knowledge. In summary, the findings present a step toward automatic TF estimation of model parameters for distributed models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;differential-soil-acidification-caused-by-parent-materials-and-land-use-changes-in-the-pearl-river-delta-region&quot;&gt;Differential soil acidification caused by parent materials and land-use changes in the Pearl River Delta region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil acidification occurs widely across the world, which has been partly attributed to land-use change. However, measureable effect of land-use change as well as parent materials on soil acidification remains poorly understood. Here, a typical area with intensive land-use change in the Pearl River Delta of China was chosen for this study. Topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm) samples (n = 169) under different land uses (paddy fields, vegetable lands and orchards) and parent materials (granite and alluvial sediment) were collected in 2020. Soil pH, exchangeable base cations, exchangeable acidity and pH buffering capacity were measured to evaluate the status of soil acidification. The change of soil pH over the last 15 years was evaluated via comparing with historical data (n = 329) in 2005. The results showed a higher exchangeable acidity and lower pH buffering capacity and exchangeable base cations of soils derived from granite compared with soils derived from alluvial sediment in 2020. In the last 15 years, significant soil acidification under different parent materials was observed under vegetable lands and orchards but not paddy fields. Faster pH decline was found under land-use change from paddy fields compared with the unchanged vegetable lands or orchards. Furthermore, stronger acidification under the same land-use change was observed for soils derived from granite compared with soils derived from alluvial sediment. These results indicate that land-use change induced soil acidification is dependent on parent materials. This study implies that cropping management such as suitable rotation operation may slow soil acidification, and measures including straw returning may ameliorate acidified soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-user-oriented-pedotransfer-functions-to-estimate-soil-bulk-density-and-available-water-capacity-at-horizon-and-profile-scales&quot;&gt;End-user-oriented pedotransfer functions to estimate soil bulk density and available water capacity at horizon and profile scales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil available water capacity (AWC) and bulk density (BD) are key properties for understanding water flows in soils, land-use planning and irrigation management. As measuring these properties is costly and time-consuming, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are commonly used to predict BD and soil moisture at a specific matric potential and then estimate AWC. Currently, operational tools to estimate AWC at the soil profile scale from data easily available are lacking. In this study, new PTFs based on the regression-tree method Cubist were developed at a regional scale to predict soil water contents at -10 kPa (field capacity) and -1585 kPa (permanent wilting point), and BD. A first PTF (PC model) required commonly measured soil properties (sand, silt, clay, organic carbon contents), while the second (PM model) required four additional predictors: qualitative information deriving from description of the soil profile. The models were validated with an independent dataset. Both models outperformed existing PTFs. AWC was then estimated at the horizon scale, soil-profile scale and in the upper 30 cm of soil. The PM model performed better than the PC model with the training dataset at the profile scale (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.87 and 0.60; RMSE = 0.186 and 0.326 mm cm(-1), respectively). Independent validation of AWC estimates at the profile scale by the PM and PC models yielded RMSE of 0.192-0.204 and 0.229-0.244 mm cm(-1), respectively. The sensitivity of AWC to estimates of soil depth and coarse-fragment content was tested. Results confirmed the importance of these variables resulting in soil observation to estimate AWC accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;potential-accumulation-of-toxic-trace-elements-in-soils-during-enhanced-rock-weathering&quot;&gt;Potential accumulation of toxic trace elements in soils during enhanced rock weathering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a carbon dioxide removal technology that aims at accelerating one of the most powerful negative feedbacks on Earth’s climate, the chemical weathering of silicates. To achieve this, ERW proposes to spread ground silicate rock on agricultural soils. According to many models, global application rates of 40 tonnes of ground basaltic rock per hectare and per year would be necessary to sequester a significant amount of CO2, representing up to 24% of the current net annual increase in atmospheric CO2. When assessing the viability of ERW as a global geo-engineering strategy, a pivotal but overlooked question to address is whether ERW may lead to toxic trace element accumulation in soils at unauthorized and potentially harmful levels. This study evaluates the legal sustainability of ERW with regard to trace element contents in soils. We compare different trace element accumulation scenarios considering a range of rock sources, application rates and national regulatory limits. The results indicate that, at the suggested annual application rate of 40 tonnes per hectare, the first regulatory limits would be exceeded after 6 and 10 years for copper and nickel, respectively. This study argues in favour of close tailoring of ERW deployment to local conditions in order to tap into its climate mitigation potential while preserving long-term soil uses.Highlights:center dot Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a carbon sequestration technology that consists in applying rock powder to soils.center dot This study evaluates whether rock powder application can lead to trace metals accumulation in soils beyond regulatory limits.center dot ERW can lead to the overrun of some environmental regulatory limits within less than a decade.center dot Specific site and rock selection will be necessary for this method to preserve long-term soil uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warming-to-increase-cropland-carbon-sink&quot;&gt;Warming to increase cropland carbon sink&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperature affects both erosion and carbon cycling in the soil. Research now shows that under warming, the replacement of soil organic carbon lost by erosion increases but the preservation of deposited carbon decreases, with an overall rise in the cropland carbon sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;experimental-drought-increased-the-belowground-sink-strength-towards-higher-topsoil-organic-carbon-stocks-in-a-temperate-mature-forest&quot;&gt;Experimental drought increased the belowground sink strength towards higher topsoil organic carbon stocks in a temperate mature forest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduced carbon assimilation by trees is often considered to lower the overall carbon sink function of drought-stressed forests. However, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks may respond differently to drought than ecosystem carbon flux dynamics, leading to imprecise predictions of soil carbon sequestration when one value is inferred from the other. As a major component of soil organic matter, SOC is the largest actively cycling terrestrial carbon reservoir, and thus fulfills various important ecosystem services. Yet, there is uncertainty about how SOC quantity and quality respond to drought in temperate forests. This study addressed the depth distri-bution of SOC stocks and soil organic matter stability in a forest exposed to artificial drought for five consecutive growing seasons below clusters of temperate mature deciduous beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and coniferous spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). In addition to SOC stock determination, we measured concentrations of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), performed density fractionation, and determined beta values of SOC (slopes of linear regressions between delta 13C of soil and log-transformed SOC content throughout soil depth profiles). Following drought, SOC stocks down to 30 cm depth increased by a factor of 1.5 under P. abies while they did not change with drought under F. sylvatica. Under both species, SOC stocks in the mineral topsoil (0-5 cm soil depth) increased by &amp;gt;80 % with drought, increasing the relative contribution of this thin depth section to total SOC from 5 % to &amp;gt;30 %. At 5-15 cm soil depth, SOC stocks decreased with drought under F. sylvatica but not under P. abies. With drought, carbon in the free light fraction (fLF) increased under F. sylvatica but declined marginally under P. abies. Results from density fractionation and beta values suggest decreased soil organic matter stability under F. sylvatica and increased stability under P. abies. Greater SOC accumulation suggests that the belowground carbon sink strength of drought-stressed forests increases, which contrasts with reduced ecosystem carbon uptake under drought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regional-scale-assessment-of-soil-functions-and-resilience-indicators-accounting-for-change-of-support-to-estimate-primary-soil-properties-and-their-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Regional-scale assessment of soil functions and resilience indicators: Accounting for change of support to estimate primary soil properties and their uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers and stakeholders are increasingly interested in evaluating soil functions and their relationships with soil physical resilience to prevent and mitigate natural and anthropogenic threats. This study aims to assess the effect of changing spatial support on estimating primary soil properties that are then used to map compound indicators of soil functions. The specific objectives are to determine the epistemic uncertainty associated with the estimates and assess the impact of accounting for the change-of-support when scaling up from the point-to the block-resolution. The study area is the southern Italian region of Campania, which is renowned for its high-quality agricultural and dairy products but is increasingly subject to soil disturbance and degradation. Seven primary soil properties (sand and clay contents, oven-dry soil bulk density, calcium carbonate, rock fragment, soil organic matter, and pH) were estimated over 75-m x 75-m blocks by jointly analyzing more than 3,000 point-based soil measure-ments with gridded terrain attributes by using multi-collocated block cokriging. Two compound soil indicators were then assessed from the maps of these soil properties: 1) the soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) in the entire region of Campania, and 2) the recharge transit time in the Sele alluvial plain where information about the mean annual depth to groundwater is available. The change-of-support proved to affect the total variance and the assessment of the extremes in the probability distributions of the primary soil variables. Our results emphasize that negative consequences occur when the change-of-support problem, upscaling in particular, is overlooked as happens when analyzing environmental data, especially for planning purposes and in the case of environmental risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-level-monte-carlo-models-for-flood-inundation-uncertainty-quantification&quot;&gt;Multi-Level Monte Carlo Models for Flood Inundation Uncertainty Quantification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flood events are the most commonly occurring natural disaster, with over 5 million properties at risk in the UK alone. Changes in the global climate are expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of flood events. Flood hazard assessments, using climate projections as input, guide policy decisions and engineering projects to reduce the impact of large return period events. Probabilistic flood modeling is required to take into account uncertainties in climate model projections. However, the dichotomous relationship between probabilistic modeling, computational cost and model resolution limits the applicability of such techniques. This paper examines improvements to traditional Monte Carlo methods using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) to quantify the uncertainty in flood extent resulting from input hydrograph uncertainty. The results demonstrate that MLMC is a more efficient modeling strategy than current methods (i.e., traditional Monte Carlo) with high resolution outputs produced in less time than previously possible. The novel application of MLMC technique to three Scottish case studies, demonstrating a variety of river characteristics, domain sizes and computational costs, using a high resolution 5 m grid resulted in a 99.2% reduction in computational cost compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods and up to 2.3 times speedup over Latin Hypercube Sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microplastics-effects-on-soil-biota-are-dependent-on-their-properties-a-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;Microplastics effects on soil biota are dependent on their properties: A meta-analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microplastics (MPs) pollution is identified as an important new global change factor potentially influencing ecosystem functions and services. MPs have been shown to strongly affect soil biota. However, whether soil biota respond differently to biodegradable and conventional MPs, and the generalizable pattern of responses of soil biota to MPs size, dose and the time of exposure to MPs remain poorly understood. Here we conducted a global-scale meta-analysis of 781 observations from 92 publications to investigate the effects of MPs on soil biota (i.e., microbiota and fauna). We also explored how soil biota respond to different experimental conditions (e.g., MPs properties and experimental duration). Results showed that MPs significantly increased soil microbial biomass, while decreased the growth and reproduction of soil fauna (nematodes, springtails and earthworms). However, MPs significantly decreased soil bacterial diversity (Shannon index) and shifted microbial community structure, and the effect of MPs on soil bacteria was more intense than that on soil fungi. The responses of soil biota were dependent on MPs types, sizes, concentrations and experimental duration. For example, biodegradable MPs had stronger impacts on soil microbial community, while had weaker negative impacts on soil fauna than conventional MPs. Likewise, smaller size of MPs appeared to have more adverse impacts on soil bacterial diversity, and the growth and reproduction of nematodes, but this trend was opposite in the reproduction of earthworms. Furthermore, the response of soil microbial community and fauna significantly correlated with the MPs concentration and experimental duration, suggesting that soil biota exposed to MPs for high concentrations and long periods were more vulnerable. Regardless of specific experimental conditions, these results highlight that prolonged MPs pollution may have considerable negative effects on the structure and function of soil biota and consequently affect the ability of soil ecosystems to provide ecosystem services and sustain human societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;isotopic-approach-to-linking-landscape-and-catchment-storage-across-multiple-spatial-scales&quot;&gt;Isotopic approach to linking landscape and catchment storage across multiple spatial scales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catchment heterogeneity leads to uncertainty about estimating timescales of storage and difficulty in extrapolating to larger scales. A heterogeneity-independent storage index (SI) was employed to build a connection with catchment characteristics, especially for landscapes, over six humid, forestry catchments. The SI is derived from the amplitudes of tracer cycles in precipitation and ephemeral/intermittent streamflow. The SI was significantly correlated with landscape metric (R2 = 0.81 and p = 0.014), specifically the fractal dimension index (FRAC) indicating the shape complexity of the landscape. Meanwhile, the topographic wetness index (TWI) (R2 = 0.77, p = 0.021) showed a close connection with the storage index as well. Close correlations suggested that the FRAC and TWI regulate the timescale of storage over the range of spatial scales, in particular the young water fraction in streams, because the SI is a heterogeneity-independent metric derived from seasonal tracer cycle amplitudes, which has a close relation to young water fraction. This also indicated the SI can be treated as an alternative travel-time metric and a reflection of the hydrological nature. Moreover, the findings implied the possibility of hydrological modeling over multiple spatial scales. The linkage between SI and landscape and topography provides insight into the mechanism of streamflow generation. Based on ephemeral streams, the crucial control of landscape and topography on the timescale of storage contributes to available water assessment and sustainable ecosystem management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development-and-application-of-new-transfer-functions-between-climate-and-soil-weathering-indices-for-paleoclimatic-reconstructions-from-chinese-loess-paleosol-sections&quot;&gt;Development and application of new transfer functions between climate and soil weathering indices for paleoclimatic reconstructions from Chinese loess-paleosol sections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree of weathering and soil formation under similar conditions with respect to parent material, relief position, vegetation, and age mainly depends on the climatic conditions. Therefore, various weathering indices have been used successfully to reconstruct past mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) based on the expression of these weathering indices in paleosols. Yet, no specific soil-climate transfer function has been established to reconstruct paleoclimates based on paleosols in Chinese loess profiles. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between several weathering indices and present climatic conditions for 49 soils throughout different climate zones in China (21°42′–47°54′ N), which were all developed in loess or similar Quaternary silty sediments. We aimed to establish soil-climate transfer functions that can be widely applied to paleosol-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions in Chinese loess archives and to apply them to a pedosedimentary record in northeastern China, where paleoclimatic information is still scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, MAT showed the strongest relationship with the weathering index ba1 ((K2O + Na2O)/Al2O3), with MAT = –29.887 ba1 + 22.361 (R2 = 0.788), and MAP showed the closest relationship with the Chemical Proxy of Alteration (CPA: Al2O3 × 100/(Al2O3 + Na2O)), with MAP = 0.0843 CPA3 – 20.143 CPA2 + 1630.7 CPA – 44,244 (R2 = 0.898). We applied these two transfer functions to a Late-Pleistocene pedosedimentary record in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, to reconstruct MAT and MAP from the onset of the Last Glacial Period until the Last Glacial Maximum. Our reconstruction yielded a warm-humid climate until the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5/4 transition and a trend towards a cooler and drier climate thereafter, interrupted by a somewhat warmer and more humid period during MIS 3. Despite several limitations, the newly established transfer functions can be applied to paleosols in loess-paleosol sections across the Chinese monsoon region and other regions around the world whose climates and parent materials are within the range covered by this study, because of the large supra-regional distribution of the soils included in this study. Thus, the new functions provide a new valuable tool for obtaining a substantial set of new paleoclimatic proxy data for various loess regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparing-satellites-and-vegetation-indices-for-cover-crop-biomass-estimation&quot;&gt;Comparing satellites and vegetation indices for cover crop biomass estimation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost-share programs based on measures of participation rather than performance are available to farmers who plant cover crops. However, cover crops only provide significant ecological benefits like reduced nutrient loss when adequate biomass is established. The purpose of this study was to determine whether satellite imagery can effectively estimate cover crop biomass in fields with diverse species composition, and whether increased spatial resolution and satellite imaging frequency can increase biomass estimation accuracy. Aboveground biomass samples of 1 m(2) were collected for 86 sites within 26 agricultural fields containing unique cover crop species composition to assess biomass production. In-field sensors were used to measure normalized difference vege-tation index (NDVI) and groundcover percentage. Three satellites (Landsat-8 [30 m resolution], Sentinel-2 [10 m resolution], and PlanetScope [3 m resolution]) were used to calculate eight vegetation indices (VIs) for com-parison with cover crop biomass. Multiple linear regression, correlation coefficients, and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to perform hierarchical clustering to rank VIs calculated from each satellite for biomass estimation accuracy. Satellites predicted cover crop biomass at the field level very accurately (r(2) up to 0.79), demonstrating the potential of large-scale biomass estimation at relatively low cost compared to in-field sam-pling. All satellite-VI pairs estimated biomass more accurately than the in-field sensors. Performance of VIs varied by satellite, but each satellite had at least one VI that performed very well for both site-level and field-averaged data. When using PlanetScope or Landsat-8 imagery, the perpendicular vegetation index provided the most accurate cover crop biomass estimation on a per-site basis and ratio vegetation index performed best using Sentinel-2 imagery. PlanetScope was the only satellite to provide useable imagery for every site due to increased revisit period; however, its increased spatial resolution did not increase estimation accuracy overall compared to Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-criteria-for-greenhouse-gas-flux-estimation-with-automatic-and-manual-chambers-a-case-study-for-n2o&quot;&gt;Identifying criteria for greenhouse gas flux estimation with automatic and manual chambers: A case study for N2O&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluxes of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) are mainly quantified using manually operated or automatic non-steady-state chambers. With both systems, fluxes are calculated as the change in N2O concentration over time using linear or non-linear regression, but the type of regression selected can have a strong influence on the N2O flux magnitude. The HMR package, a regression-based implementation of the Hutchinson &amp;amp; Mosier Regression, is a widely used software for trace gas flux calculation that provides a recommendation on the most appropriate regression method based on several criteria. New parameters were recently introduced which allow for pre-filtering based on sample variance (pfvar and pfalpha), and for constraining the curvilinearity of concentration-time series(SatPct and SatTimeMin). Currently, there are no guidelines on how to choose the best parameters for specific user conditions. Here we address this knowledge gap using datasets from manual and automatic chambers, and sensitivity analyses. We found that the effect of parameter settings on the cumulative fluxes was greater for manual chamber data compared to the automatic chamber data, with ranges of up to 67.3% and 1.5%, respectively. The parameter pfvar was identified as highly sensitive for both manual and automatic chambers; it is, therefore, critical to select a threshold for when to allow for non-linear flux calculation that accurately represents the given measurement precision. This can be estimated from the variance of N2O measurements at ambient concentration levels. The parameter SatTimeMin was critical for manual chamber data where the curvature is much less constrained due to the lower number of observations. The parameter pfalpha was the least sensitive and can be set at a p-value equal to 0.05 following common statistical practice. Parameter values depend on the expected flux characteristics with a given chamber design and are currently best selected based on visual inspection of the data. This study identifies where and how specific care should be taken for the selection of parameters in the HMR package, which may contribute to standardizing the methodologies used worldwide for N2O flux calculations, supporting initiatives in which data from many studies need to be combined. Highlights The HMR package, an implementation of the Hutchinson &amp;amp; Mosier Regression, is a widely used software for trace gas flux calculation that provides a recommendation on the most appropriate regression method based on several criteria. New parameters in the updated HMR package constrains the use of nonlinear flux calculation and inclusion of outliers. The new parameters affect the cumulative emissions of N2O obtained with manual and automated chambers differently. We found that the choice of parameter values led to differences in cumulative N2O emissions of up to 67.3% This study identifies where and how specific care should be taken for the selection of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microorganisms play pivotal roles in soil processes. Metabolically related microorganisms constitute functional groups, and diverse microbial functional groups control nutrient cycling in soils. This study explored environmental (i.e., rainfall, temperature) and soil factors driving the distribution of bacterial functional groups involved in soil carbon (C) cycling in paired natural and agricultural ecosystems. Soil samples were collected at a regional scale covering gradients of temperature and rainfall across two orthogonal transects (similar to 1000 km) in New South Wales, Australia. Putative functions of bacteria were linked to two soil C fractions: particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC). We found: (i) temperature and rainfall were important drivers of bacterial functional groups, while soil properties, such as pH, soil C and nitrogen (N), also presented significant contributions; (ii) community structure of bacteria involved in C cycling was mainly related to POC content but not to MAOC; (iii) paired sampling showed that agricultural practices had significant impacts on the composition and responses of soil bacterial functional groups. This study demonstrated the environmental regulation (e.g., temperature and rainfall) of soil microbial functional groups at large scales, which was altered by agricultural practices.HighlightsSoil bacteria involved in C cycling were investigated across two similar to 1000 km transects.Temperature and rainfall were important drivers of bacterial functional groups at large scale.Paired sampling showed that agriculture led to a significant shift in bacterial functional groups.Community structure of bacterial functional groups were correlated with soil POC but not MAOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simulating-water-and-nitrogen-runoff-with-apsim&quot;&gt;Simulating water and nitrogen runoff with APSIM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the impact of potential reductions of terrain-targeted nitrogen (N) fertilisation rates on N losses a simulation study was carried out using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). To simulate N runoff a simple approach was used, in which runoff is based on the N concentration in the soil solution and an extraction coefficient. Firstly, APSIM parameters that have the largest effect on runoff of water and N were determined for terrains with different slopes for a poorly drained silt loam. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to assess the effect of soil hydraulic properties and soil organic carbon content on runoff losses. Finally, APSIM was set up to simulate pasture production and water and N dynamics (including pasture N uptake, leaching and N runoff) for a farm on rolling hills in South Canterbury, New Zealand. Two different fertilisation approaches were used, either scheduled or based on the aboveground N concentration of the pasture. For the poorly drained silt loam, the rainfall intensity and the surface conductance had the highest effect on the amount of water lost by runoff. Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation and field capacity, as well as plant available water content also controlled runoff of water and N, while the organic carbon content of the topsoil had less effect on N runoff. Both the extraction coefficient and the depth considered to exchange N with the runoff water affected the amount of N lost via runoff. Using the aboveground pasture N concentration prior to fertilisation had positive effects on pasture yield and reduced N runoff losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-empirical-model-for-prediction-of-topsoil-deformation-in-field-traffic&quot;&gt;An empirical model for prediction of topsoil deformation in field traffic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural topsoils are characterized by a heterogeneous mixture of structural units with a considerable difference in soil mechanical properties. Mechanistic modeling of compaction for this layer is challenging because of the need to parameterize model input parameters. This study quantified soil deformation during loading in semi-confined conditions and searched for drivers decisive for observed strains with no a priori assumptions of material properties. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in the plough layer of eleven sandy and loamy soils in Denmark. The samples were adjusted to either of the following matric potentials: -30, -50, -75, -100, -160 and -300 hPa (pF from-1.5 to-2.5). Cores at each water condition were loaded with an annulus covering one third of the soil surface at either of the following normal loads: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 kPa. Multiple regression was performed to estimate the best model describing the variation in soil compressibility. Measured strain, epsilon, decreased with increase in soil organic matter, bulk density and pF, but the effect of pF was affected by soil clay content. The model explained-84 % of the variation in data and predicted well measured strain for two independent data sets. The regression model is suggested for prediction of soil deformation of arable topsoils in field traffic. A procedure is described for the prediction, including calculation of the relevant stress based on loading characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current Earth system models (ESMs) project dramatic slowing (28-42% by 2100) of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Southern Meridional Overturning Circulation (SMOC) across a range of climate scenarios, with a complete shutdown of SMOC possible by year 2300. Slowing meridional overturning circulation (MOC) differentially impacts the ocean biological and solubility carbon pumps, leaving the net impact on ocean carbon uptake uncertain. Here using a suite of ESMs, we show that slowing MOC reduces anthropogenic carbon uptake by the solubility pump but increases deep-ocean storage of carbon and nutrients by the biological pump. The net effect reduces ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2. The deep-ocean nutrient sequestration will increasingly depress global-scale, marine net primary production over time. MOC slowdown represents a positive feedback that could extend or intensify peak-warmth climate conditions on multi-century timescales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perspective-what-might-it-cost-to-reconfigure-food-systems&quot;&gt;Perspective: What might it cost to reconfigure food systems?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even an approximate estimate of the amount of investment required globally to reconfigure food systems for resilience and sustainability in the face of climate change could help to catalyse the urgent action that is needed. A report published in 2020 set out eleven actions that were identified as being needed to reconfigure food systems. Here we estimate the annual cost of implementing these eleven actions to be USD 1.3 +/- 0.1 trillion. Half of this is needed to halt conversion of forests and peatlands for agriculture, with the remainder used to reduce producer risk, lower emissions and strengthen the policy, finance and innovation enablers of change. This cost, though large, is equivalent to less than 7 percent of the negative externalities generated annually by current food systems. The costs of inaction will far outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financials-threaten-to-undermine-the-functioning-of-emissions-markets&quot;&gt;Financials threaten to undermine the functioning of emissions markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participation of financial actors is a key design issue in all emissions allowance markets. Although financials perform several necessary market functions, excessive speculation may undermine market functioning. The potential for harm is gaining prominence as tighter emission limits increasingly attract speculators and investors into allowance markets worldwide. However, adequate warning systems and tools to appraise the beneficial and detrimental facets of financial trading are wanting. We develop preliminary elements of a diagnostic toolbox to assess the scale and impacts of speculation and apply it to the EU emissions trading system. This Perspective seeks to inform current policy debates and invites further research to establish speculation-monitoring systems for allowance markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-incorporating-soil-in-the-life-cycle-assessment-procedure-to-improve-the-sustainability-of-agricultural-management&quot;&gt;The importance of incorporating soil in the life cycle assessment procedure to improve the sustainability of agricultural management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formidable ability of soil to store carbon has attracted an increasing number of studies, but few of them included soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration as part of a carbon balance assessment in the agroecosystem. This raises some interesting questions: 1) how orchards conversion increase soil capacity to mitigate the green-house gases (GHG) emissions by storing C? 2) can it be considered in life cycle assessment (LCA)? 3) can SOC pools and soil biochemical properties determination improve LCA interpretation? To answer these questions, this study selected a ten- and fifteen-years-old peach orchards, a twenty-years-old pear orchard, a thirty-years-old kiwi orchard in south-east part of Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), and a cereals’ field as reference. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 and 15-30 cm depths, and the SOC pool amounts (i.e., labile and recalcitrant) determined. LCA was used to estimate the GHG emissions (CO(2)eq) from the orchards. Results showed that the conversion from cereals to orchard production increased OC stock (+82 % on average) suggesting that orchards cultivation systems have the capacity to enrich soil organic matter. Fertilization had the greatest impact on CO(2)eq emission accounting for at least 40 % of total CO(2)eq emissions. Kiwi cultivation had the highest impact on GHG emissions mainly due to the high water and nutrient demand (0.045 and 0.149 kg CO(2)eq kg 1 fruit yr 1, respectively). When taking into account the C-CO(2)eq loss by fruit cultivation and C storage in soils, results would indicate that peach and pear orchard agroecosystems promote C sequestration. Conversely, kiwi cultivation showed large CO(2)eq emissions only partly counterbalanced by SOC sequestration. This study highlights the importance of including soils in LCA: if made mandatory this would allow a wider, yet more detailed, picture of the impact of agricultural practices on C budget. This simple step could help optimise resource management and at the same time improve agroecosystem sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-model-simulation-to-evaluate-soil-loss-potential-in-diversified-agricultural-landscapes&quot;&gt;Using model simulation to evaluate soil loss potential in diversified agricultural landscapes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural production is facing a challenging transition through changing political framework conditions and climate change. Innovative field use and land management through temporal and spatial diversification measures support the political efforts to achieve the European Green Deal. However, increasing precipitation intensities through climate change are leading to an increased risk of soil erosion by water. To mitigate such risk, soil erosion should be taken into account when redesigning fields and landscapes. This paper aims to assess the present erosion risk situation in the innovative on-farm field experiment “patchCROP “ with several implemented spatio-temporal crop diversification measures (field size, flower strips, crop rotation), using the physically-based Erosion 3D simulation model at the field scale. The modelling results showed that field reshaping from one large field into smaller field segments had the potential to reduce soil erosion. Flower strips reduced the sediment discharge to approximately half of that of small field segments without flower strips. However, as model results indicated, heterogeneous landscapes showed complex erosion and deposition patterns. To identify these, making use of physically based soil erosion models in new field arrangements is a critical future task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-texture-and-ph-affect-soil-co2-efflux-in-hardwood-floodplain-forests-of-the-lower-middle-elbe-river&quot;&gt;Soil texture and pH affect soil CO2 efflux in hardwood floodplain forests of the lower middle Elbe River&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floodplain ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon (C) cycle, particularly due to their C sink potential in hardwood floodplain forests. However, in these forests, interactions between a heterogeneous micro-relief and anthropogenic landscape changes make estimating C loss through soil CO2 efflux difficult. To determine the drivers of soil CO2 efflux, we selected six hardwood floodplain forests at the lower middle Elbe River, which were distributed among different relief positions (low-lying or high-elevated) in the active and former flooding zone. We measured soil CO2 effluxes over a full year using the closed-chamber method. Based on the response of soil CO2 efflux to soil moisture and temperature, annual efflux rates were determined, which were then related to soil properties, such as pH, texture, soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) content. Soil CO2 efflux ranged between 1006 (&amp;amp; PLUSMN;99) and 2214 (&amp;amp; PLUSMN;118) gC m(-2) year(-1). Maximum efflux occurred in a former floodplain forest that was disconnected from Elbe River water table fluctuations. SOC-specific soil CO2 efflux (gC gSOC(-1) year(-1)) was smallest in low-lying forests of the active flooding zone and reflected by the appearance of redoximorphic mottling close to the soil surface. Fine texture (&amp;lt; 6.3 mu m), SOC and N were related positively and electric conductivity, C/N and pH negatively to total soil CO2 efflux. Soil pH and fine texture were the strongest univariate predictors for total soil CO2 efflux (both R-2 = 0.59). Fine texture, pH and C/N ratio explained 66% of the variance in total soil CO2 efflux according to multiple linear regression. We conclude that, in hardwood floodplain forests, soil CO2 efflux is mainly controlled by fine texture and soil pH. Fine texture can be related to soil moisture and nutrient availability and may have a positive effect on the activity of microorganisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-bacterial-and-fungal-communities-show-within-field-heterogeneity-that-varies-by-land-management-and-distance-metric&quot;&gt;Soil bacterial and fungal communities show within field heterogeneity that varies by land management and distance metric&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing interest in the use of microbial metrics to evaluate soil health raises the issue of how fine-scale het-erogeneity can affect microbial community measurements. Here we analyse bacterial and fungal communities of over 100 soil samples across 17 pasture farms and evaluate beta diversity at different scales. We find large variation in microbial communities between different points in the same field, and if Aitchison distance is used we find that within-field variation is as high as between-farm variation. However, if Bray-Curtis or Jaccard distance are used this variation is partially explained by differences in soil pH and vegetation and is higher under mob grazing for fungi. Hence, field scale variation in microbial communities can impact the evaluation of soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-physical-method-for-downscaling-land-surface-temperatures-using-surface-energy-balance-theory&quot;&gt;A physical method for downscaling land surface temperatures using surface energy balance theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine-resolution land surface temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared remote sensing images is a good indicator of surface water status and plays an essential role in the exchange of energy and water between land and atmosphere. A physical surface energy balance (SEB)-based LST downscaling method (DTsEB) is developed to downscale coarse remotely sensed thermal infrared LST products with fine-resolution visible and near-infrared data. The DTsEB method is advantageous for its ability to mechanically interrelate surface variables contributing to the spatial variation of LST, to quantitatively weigh the contributions of each related variable within a physical framework, and to efficaciously avoid the subjective selection of scaling factors and the establishment of statistical regression relationships. The applicability of the DTsEB method was tested by downscaling 12 scenes of 990 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and aggregated Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LST products to 90 m resolution at six overpass times between 2005 and 2015 over three 9.9 km by 9.9 km cropland (mixed by grass, tree, and built-up land) study areas. Three typical LST downscaling methods, namely the widely applied TsHARP, the later developed least median square regression downscaling (LMS) and the geographically weighted regression (GWR), were introduced for inter comparison. The results showed that the DTsEB method could more effectively reconstruct the subpixel spatial variations in LST within the coarse-resolution pixels and achieve a better downscaling accuracy than the TsHARP, LMS and GWR methods. The DTsEB method yielded, on average, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.01 K and 1.42 K when applied to the MODIS datasets and aggregated ASTER datasets, respectively, which were lower than those obtained with the TsHARP method, with average RMSEs of 2.41 K and 1.71 K, the LMS method, with average RMSEs of 2.35 K and 1.63 K, and the GWR method, with average RMSEs of 2.38 K and 1.64 K, respectively. The contributions of the related surface variables to the subpixel spatial variation in the LST varied both spatially and temporally and were different from each other. In summary, the DTsEB method was demonstrated to outperform the TsHARP, LMS, and GWR methods and could be used as a good alternative for downscaling LST products from coarse to fine resolution with high robustness and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-alteration-of-soil-quality-degradation-and-resistance-indices-under-different-land-uses-through-network-and-factor-analysis&quot;&gt;Assessing alteration of soil quality, degradation, and resistance indices under different land uses through network and factor analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-increasing population and their needs necessitate sustainable use of soil and the other natural resources. In these circumstances land use changes may occur for supplying the food and settlement requirements of the increased population. Therefore, it is needed to evaluate and monitor quality and degradation of the soils. Recently, identification of appropriate soil quality (SQI) and degradation (SDI) indices for assessing sustainable use of soil resources has received increased attention. However, evaluation of quality, degradation, and resistance indices through various new approaches (e.g., network, NA and factor, FA analysis) particularly under different land uses to determine their susceptibility have been rarely conducted. The present study aimed to i) determine SQI, SDI, and resistance (SRI) indices NA and FA approaches under different land uses; ii) investigate the most influential attributes to soil quality (SQ); and iii) to compare SQIs obtained using two different Integrated (IQI) and Nemoro (NQI) Quality Indices, and indicator selection (Minimum Data Set, MDS and Total Data Set, TDS) approaches. Composite soil samples of cropland, forestland, and rangeland were collected and twentyone soil physicochemical and fertility indicators were measured. MDS was determined using principal component analysis (PCA). The SDI and SRI were computed and compared. Results revealed that the SDI was -13.8% and -4.6% for the cropland and rangeland, respectively indicating inappropriate soil managerial practices in cropland. SRI was 0.01 and 0.41 for the cropland and rangeland, respectively. The lowest SRI values were obtained for critical level of organic matter (CLOM), organic matter (OM), zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) showing that these properties, compared with the others, are more sensitive to land use change. Regression equations between SDI and SRI revealed that these substantial relationships show similar trends indicating that these are useful indices to determine SQ and evaluate the effect of land use change and managerial practices. Soils in cropland had a significantly lower deterioration index (DI) (-66.70) than that of the other land uses. SQI in the cropland was the lowest, especially when screened with the NA method. Furthermore, SQI showed the highest correlation with clay and CLOM. The linear SQI value derived from correlation-based-NA method showed greater max/min ratios than that of the FA. Therefore, the NA-based-SQI, as a novel statistical approach, would be more effective than the SQI-derived-FA for evaluating the effects of land use changes and managerial practices. In general, the mentioned technique is a relatively comprehensive approach integrating different influential soil indicators with various weights showing their contributions to soil quality or degradation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-soil-moisture-interface-of-multi-depth-change-over-time&quot;&gt;Interactive soil moisture interface of multi-depth change over time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimation of soil moisture throughout a crop root zone (nowcasting) is prone to spatial error, even when the time variable (forecasting) is removed. Measurement at discrete points in the field is now common using multi -depth sensors reporting at high temporal resolution, e.g.; every 15 or 60 min. The agricultural industry standard for data representation is suitable for prescriptive applications such as irrigation scheduling but is inadequate for descriptive applications such as reviewing change through a rainfed growing season. We developed an inter-active interface for animating past data and tested it on 61 EnviroPro (R) capacitance probes for up to 24 months starting mid 2019. Probes were installed in grey vertisol cropping soils of northern NSW, Australia, which contract when dry to produce deep cracks. When static, the interface highlights change in moisture at each level to the present date, with a default value of seven days. The interface shows these values against historical ex-tremes for the installation duration. When animated, the interface enables exploration of soil moisture change over one or more seasons by depth and crop phenology. We believe this descriptive use of data improves un-derstanding of crop-water relations, particularly for dryland crop production systems where management de-cisions are reliant on longer-term projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land-use-legacy-footprint-in-mediterranean-forest-soils-an-infrared-spectroscopy-approach&quot;&gt;Land use legacy footprint in Mediterranean forest soils: An infrared spectroscopy approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemical properties of forest soils can strongly influence this compartment vulnerability to climate change ef-fects. Past human activities can play a major role in structuring soil chemical properties. In the Mediterranean region, abandonment of terrace agriculture since 1860 induced the coexistence of forests with different ages. Here, soil chemical signature (SCS) was compared between very recent, recent and ancient forests using Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy and other chemical properties (total C and N, CaCO3 percentages). Land Use Legacy (LUL) effects were analysed depending on soil depths and on contrasted climate conditions (humid vs subhumid Mediterranean climates). Statistic treatments, Linear Mixed-Effect and Anova COMmon DIMension models, were used to highlight the influence of depth’s soil, climate and LUL effects. Interestingly, the soil depth did not influence LUL effect on soil spectra. The effect of climate, LUL and their interactions were observed on the SCS. Higher available N was observed in soils from ancient forests than in soils from very recent forests. Moreover, mineral fraction discriminated soils with different LUL (very recent vs recent and ancient forests) and this depended on climate. Under subhumid climate, soils from very recent forests were indeed negatively correlated with the mineral fraction, while under humid climate, they were positively correlated to it. Finally, a recovery of soils chemical properties was observed in recent forests under humid climate, while under subhumid climate, SCS of post agricultural forests was different from that of ancient forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliable manipulation of soil organic matter (SOM) - a necessity for optimal land management - is constrained by our limited mechanistic understanding of SOM formation. Here we propose a novel mechanistic element that may contribute to SOM dynamics, supplementing existing frameworks, based on evolutionary-ecological rather than chemical or physical limitations to decomposition. We argue that decomposition of some substrates may be constrained by spatial competition from opportunists. We describe and test a mathematical model based on our framework, providing a proof-of-concept that substrate can, in principle, be spared decomposition and accumulate even when it is physically and chemically accessible. Our framework can help explain a variety of SOM dynamics, including priming and the suppression of decomposition by nitrogen addition, as well as the typical composition of SOM. An augmented mechanistic framework for understanding SOM dynamics can help guide targeted empirical study, which in turn can contribute to more optimised land management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;knowledge-is-power-where-digital-soil-mapping-needs-geopedology&quot;&gt;Knowledge Is Power: Where Digital Soil Mapping Needs Geopedology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of current digital soil mapping (DSM) practice relies on terrain, climate and remote sensing-derived covariates. These are easy to obtain and can serve as proxies to soil forming factors and from these to soil properties or classes. However, mapping of soil bodies, not properties in isolation, is what gives insight into the soil landscape. A naïve attempt at correlating environmental covariates will not succeed in the presence of unmapped variations in parent material, soil bodies and landforms inherited from past environments. It also takes no account of spatial relations among soil bodies. Geopedology integrates an understanding of the geomorphic conditions under which soils evolve with field observations. Examples where simplistic DSM would fail but geopedology would succeed in mapping and, even better, explaining the soil distribution are shown: exhumed paleosols, low-relief depositional environments, inverted landscapes, and recent post-glacial landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-soil-structure-affect-water-infiltration-a-meta-data-systematic-review&quot;&gt;How does soil structure affect water infiltration? A meta-data systematic review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil structure is a key attribute of soil quality and health that significantly impacts water infiltration. Structure can be significantly altered by natural or anthropogenic drivers including soil management practices and can in turn impact soil infiltration. Those changes in soil structure are often complex to quantify and can lead to conflicting impacts on water infiltration into soils. Here, we present a narrative systematic review (SR) of the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as defined methods for literature search and data extraction, our systematic review led to a total of 153 papers divided into two sets: experimental (131) and theoretical (22) papers. That implied a significant number of in-situ and field experiments that were conducted to assess the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration under the influence of different land uses and soil practices. Analysis of the metadata extracted from the collected papers revealed significant impacts of soil structure on water infiltration. Those effects were further attributed to land use and management, where we demonstrate the impact of three unique categories: soil amendments, crop management and tillage. Furthermore, significant correlations were established between infiltration rate and soil structural properties, with R2 values ranging from 0.51 to 0.80 and for saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil structural properties, with R2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.78. Finally, our review highlighted the significant absence of and the need for theoretical frameworks studying the impacts of soil structure on water infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-modelling-predictions-show-high-uncertainty-of-required-carbon-input-changes-to-reach-a-4-parts-per-thousand-target&quot;&gt;Multi-modelling predictions show high uncertainty of required carbon input changes to reach a 4 parts per thousand target&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soils store vast amounts of carbon (C) on land, and increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in already managed soils such as croplands may be one way to remove C from the atmosphere, thereby limiting subsequent warming. The main objective of this study was to estimate the amount of additional C input needed to annually increase SOC stocks by 4%(0) at 16 long-term agricultural experiments in Europe, including exogenous organic matter (EOM) additions. We used an ensemble of six SOC models and ran them under two configurations: (1) with default parametrization and (2) with parameters calibrated site-by-site to fit the evolution of SOC stocks in the control treatments (without EOM). We compared model simulations and analysed the factors generating variability across models. The calibrated ensemble was able to reproduce the SOC stock evolution in the unfertilised control treatments. We found that, on average, the experimental sites needed an additional 1.5 +/- 1.2 Mg C ha(-)(1) year(-1) to increase SOC stocks by 4%(0) per year over 30 years, compared to the C input in the control treatments (multi-model median +/- median standard deviation across sites). That is, a 119% increase compared to the control. While mean annual temperature, initial SOC stocks and initial C input had a significant effect on the variability of the predicted C input in the default configuration (i.e., the relative standard deviation of the predicted C input from the mean), only water-related variables (i.e., mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) explained the divergence between models when calibrated. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks in agriculture and accentuates the need to increasingly lean on multi-model ensembles when predicting SOC stock trends and related processes. To increase the reliability of SOC models under future climate change, we suggest model developers to better constrain the effect of water-related variables on SOC decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applications-of-computed-tomography-ct-in-environmental-soil-and-plant-sciences&quot;&gt;Applications of Computed Tomography (CT) in environmental soil and plant sciences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computed tomography (CT) in combination with advanced image processing can be used to non-invasively and non-destructively visualize complex interiors of living and non-living media in 2 and 3-dimensional space. In addition to medical applications, CT has also been widely used in soil and plant science for visual and quanti-tative descriptions of physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes. The technique has been used successfully on numerous applications. However, with a rapidly evolving CT technologies and expanding ap-plications, a renewed review is desirable. Only a few attempts have been made to collate and review examples of CT applications involving the integrated field of soil and plant research in recent years. Therefore, the objectives of this work were to: (1) briefly introduce the basic principles of CT and image processing; (2) identify the research status and hot spots of CT using bibliometric analysis based on Web of Science literature over the past three decades; (3) provide an overall review of CT applications in soil science for measuring soil properties (e.g., porous soil structure, soil components, soil biology, heat transfer, water flow, and solute transport); and (4) give an overview of applications of CT in plant science to detect morphological structures, plant material properties, and root-soil interaction. Moreover, the limitations of CT and image processing are discussed and future per-spectives are given.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, despite their importance, the global biogeography and ecological drivers of soil micronutrients remain virtually unknown, limiting our capacity to anticipate abrupt unexpected changes in soil micronutrients in the face of climate change. Here, we analyzed &amp;gt;1300 topsoil samples to examine the global distribution of six metallic micronutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Co and Ni) across all continents, climates and vegetation types. We found that warmer arid and tropical ecosystems, present in the least developed countries, sustain the lowest contents of multiple soil micronutrients. We further provide evidence that temperature increases may potentially result in abrupt and simultaneous reductions in the content of multiple soil micronutrients when a temperature threshold of 12-14 degrees C is crossed, which may be occurring on 3% of the planet over the next century. Altogether, our findings provide fundamental understanding of the global distribution of soil micronutrients, with direct implications for the maintenance of ecosystem functioning, rangeland management and food production in the warmest and poorest regions of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effects-of-land-clearing-for-agriculture-on-soil-organic-carbon-stocks-in-drylands-a-meta-analysis&quot;&gt;Effects of land clearing for agriculture on soil organic carbon stocks in drylands: A meta-analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural activities have been expanding globally with the pressure to provide food security to the earth’s growing population. These agricultural activities have profoundly impacted soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in global drylands. However, the effects of clearing natural ecosystems for cropland (CNEC) on SOC are uncertain. To improve our understanding of carbon emissions and sequestration under different land uses, it is necessary to characterize the response patterns of SOC stocks to different types of CNEC. We conducted a meta-analysis with mixed-effect model based on 873 paired observations of SOC in croplands and adjacent natural ecosystems from 159 individual studies in global drylands. Our results indicate that CNEC significantly (p &amp;lt; .05) affects SOC stocks, resulting from a combination of natural land clearing, cropland management practices (fertilizer application, crop species, cultivation duration) and the significant negative effects of initial SOC stocks. Increases in SOC stocks (in 1 m depth) were found in croplands which previously natural land (deserts and shrublands) had low SOC stocks, and the increases were 278.86% (95% confidence interval, 196.43%-361.29%) and 45.38% (26.53%-62.23%), respectively. In contrast, SOC stocks (in 1 m depth) decreased by 24.11% (18.38%-29.85%) and 10.70% (1.80%-19.59%) in clearing forests and grasslands for cropland, respectively. We also established the general response curves of SOC stocks change to increasing cultivation duration, which is crucial for accurately estimating regional carbon dynamics following CNEC. SOC stocks increased significantly (p &amp;lt; .05) with high long-term fertilizer consumption in cleared grasslands with low initial SOC stocks (about 27.2 Mg ha(-1)). The results derived from our meta-analysis could be used for refining the estimation of dryland carbon dynamics and developing SOC sequestration strategies to achieve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-effects-of-global-change-drivers-as-determinants-of-the-link-between-soil-biodiversity-and-ecosystem-functioning&quot;&gt;Interactive effects of global change drivers as determinants of the link between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biodiversity, both aboveground and belowground, is negatively affected by global changes such as drought or warming. This loss of biodiversity impacts Earth’s ecosystems, as there is a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF). Even though soils host a large fraction of biodiversity that underlies major ecosystem functions, studies exploring the relationship between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (sBEF) as influenced by global change drivers (GCDs) remain scarce. Here we highlight the need to decipher sBEF relationships under the effect of interactive GCDs that are intimately connected in a changing world. We first state that sBEF relationships depend on the type of function (e.g., C cycling or decomposition) and biodiversity facet (e.g., abundance, species richness, or biomass) considered. Then, we shed light on the impact of single and interactive GCDs on soil biodiversity and sBEF and show that results from scarce studies studying interactive effects range from antagonistic to additive to synergistic when two individual GCDs cooccur. This indicates the need for studies quantitatively accounting for the impacts of interactive GCDs on sBEF relationships. Finally, we provide guidelines for optimized methodological and experimental approaches to study sBEF in a changing world that will provide more valuable information on the real impact of (interactive) GCDs on sBEF. Together, we highlight the need to decipher the sBEF relationship in soils to better understand soil functioning under ongoing global changes, as changes in sBEF are of immediate importance for ecosystem functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soil-acidity-amelioration-improves-n-and-c-cycles-in-the-short-term-in-a-system-with-soybean-followed-by-maize-guinea-grass-intercropping&quot;&gt;Soil acidity amelioration improves N and C cycles in the short term in a system with soybean followed by maize-guinea grass intercropping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lime application has been associated with N and C losses from agricultural systems through NO3- leaching, N2O and CO2 emissions. However, we hypothesized that in an intensive crop system where soybean is grown in rotation with maize intercropped with a forage grass, liming associated with the application of gypsum to ameliorate the subsoil, and N fertilization increase soil N and C by improving root and crop growth. To evaluate the interaction of lime, gypsum and N fertilizer on soil and N and C partial balances, an experiment was carried out under no-till, where soybean was grown in rotation with maize intercropped with Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv Tanzania) as relay crop. Lime and gypsum were applied before soybean planting in October 2016 and October 2017. Two N rates (0 and 160 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of N as ammonium sulphate) were applied to maize annually. Outputs through N-NO3- leaching, N-N2O emission and N-NH3 volatilization did not exceed 30 kg ha(-1) of N in two years. The N exported in grains consisted in 96% of the N output and was greater with fertilizer and lime. Soil acidity amelioration and N-fertilization favoured soil C fixation with high plant biomass production (C in plant residue, roots, and grains), while soil C-CO2 emission was not affected, and soil C increased. Although the partial N balance was negative, there was an increase in soil N, probably due to biological N fixation by soybean, which was not considered in the partial balance. We concluded that lime and gypsum application, along with an adequate N fertilization, to a tropical highly-weathered soil with soybean cropped in rotation with maize-guinea grass intercropping benefit N and C cycles and the environment in the short-term, increasing soil N and C stocks and reducing GHG emitted to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feasibility-assessment-on-use-of-proximal-geophysical-sensors-to-support-precision-management&quot;&gt;Feasibility assessment on use of proximal geophysical sensors to support precision management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study was conducted at three sites in North Dakota to strengthen understanding of the usefulness of different proximal geophysical data types in agricultural contexts of varying pedology. This study hypothesizes that electromagnetic induction (EMI), gamma-ray sensor (GRS), cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS), and elevation data layers are all useful in multiple linear regression (MLR) predictions of soil properties that meet expert criteria at three agricultural sites. In addition to geophysical data collection with vehicle-mounted sensors, 15 soil samples were collected at each site and analyzed for nine soil properties of interest. A set of model training data was compiled by pairing the sampled soil property measurements with the nearest geophysical data. Eleven models passed expert-defined uncertainty criteria at Site 1, 16 passed at Site 2, and 14 passed at Site 3. Electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM), available water holding capacity, silt, and clay were predicted at Site 1 with an R-squared of prediction (Rpred2)$(R_{pred}&amp;lt;^&amp;gt;2)$ &amp;gt; .50 and acceptable root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). Bulk density (BD), OM, available water capacity, silt, and clay were predicted with Rpred2$R_{pred}&amp;lt;^&amp;gt;2$ &amp;gt; .50 and acceptable RMSEP at Site 2. At Site 3, no soil properties were predicted with acceptable RMSEP and an Rpred2$R_{pred}&amp;lt;^&amp;gt;2$ &amp;gt; .50. These results confirm feasibility of our method, and the authors recommend the prioritization of EMI data collection if geophysical data collection is limited to a single mapping effort and calibration soil samples are few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods-for-downhole-soil-water-sensor-calibration-complications-of-bulk-density-and-water-content-variations&quot;&gt;Methods for downhole soil water sensor calibration-Complications of bulk density and water content variations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downhole soil volumetric water content (VWC) sensors are used in access tubes to assess the soil water content at multiple depths. If sensor readings are spaced closely enough vertically and are accurate enough, then accurate soil profile water content storage and change in storage can be determined over the depth range of readings, leading to accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) if readings extend to well below the root zone. Even if sensing only covers the active root zone, soil water depletion may be determined well enough to inform irrigation scheduling. While sensor accuracy is dependent on many factors, including the sensor’s physical principle of operation, soil-specific calibration is typically required for good accuracy. In soils with multiple horizons (layers) of different texture, bulk density (BD), or chemical composition, horizon-specific calibrations may be necessary. We describe methods and equipment used for downhole sensor calibration to typical accuracy of &amp;lt;0.01 m(3) m(-3) with specific reference to calibration of 10 neutron scattering meters in a soil that required three different horizon-specific calibrations. Our results contrast with the factory calibration, which would result in a 38-mm error in water stored in a 1.5-m deep profile of our soil. We describe variability of measured VWC and BD with depth, distance, and water content and the errors that result from using BD to convert mass basis (g g(-1)) water content data to VWC data, which can be as much as 35 mm (7.26% underestimation) for soil water storage in a 1.5-m deep profile of our soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-carbon-isotopic-composition-delta-c-13-as-a-proxy-of-organic-matter-dynamics-in-soils-on-the-western-shore-of-lake-baikal&quot;&gt;Stable Carbon Isotopic Composition (delta C-13) as a Proxy of Organic Matter Dynamics in Soils on the Western Shore of Lake Baikal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the main factors that control carbon dynamics in soils is an urgent problem in the context of modern climate change. The analysis of stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) composition is one of the approaches to understanding this dynamics. The study was carried out in the landscapes of the southeastern slope and foothills of the Primorskii Range, characterized by contrasting physico-geographical conditions. Climatic parameters, spatial variations in the composition of stable carbon isotopes and their distribution in soil profiles, and soil physicochemical properties controlling carbon dynamics have been analyzed. The soil humus horizons formed in mountainous tundra and steppe landscapes manifest the highest delta C-13 values (-24.72 and -23.97 … -24.75 parts per thousand ); whereas the lowest (-25.61 … -27.18 parts per thousand ) values are registered in the mountainous taiga soils. Based on the calculation of linear dependence between delta C-13 values and the total carbon content in soil, which varies with the depth, the carbon turnover intensity was determined using the slope of linear regression. It was revealed that under the contrasting conditions of mountainous tundra and steppe landscapes, the climate (deficiency of heat and moisture) has a significant impact on the intensity of organic matter transformation, blocking the effect of edaphic (soil profile) factors. Under more favorable climatic conditions of mountainous taiga landscapes, the dynamics of organic matter in soils is controlled mainly by edaphic factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fraser-island-kgari-and-initiation-of-the-great-barrier-reef-linked-by-middle-pleistocene-sea-level-change&quot;&gt;Fraser Island (K’gari) and initiation of the Great Barrier Reef linked by Middle Pleistocene sea-level change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eastern Australia coastline is characterized by impressive coastal landforms and an extensive northward-moving longshore drift system that have been influenced by a stable, long-term tectonic history over the Quaternary period. However, the timing and drivers of the formation of two conspicuous landscape features-Fraser Island (K’gari) and the Great Barrier Reef-remain poorly understood. Here we use optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating to constrain the formation of the extensive dunes that make up Fraser Island, the world’s largest sand island, and adjacent Cooloola Sand Mass in southeastern Queensland. We find that both formed between 1.2 Ma and 0.7 Ma, during a global climate reconfiguration across the Middle Pleistocene transition. They formed as a direct result of increased amplitude of sea-level fluctuations associated with increasing global ice volume that redistributed previously stored sediment across the continental shelf. The development of Fraser Island dramatically reduced sediment supply to the continental shelf north of the island. This facilitated widespread coral reef formation in the southern and central Great Barrier Reef and was a necessary precondition for its development. This major reorganization of the coastal sedimentary system is probably not unique to eastern Australia and should be investigated in other passive-margin coastlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption of sediment flows along the eastern Australia coast due to the Middle Pleistocene formation of Fraser Island set the stage for Great Barrier Reef initiation, according to optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating of sand dunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variability-of-phosphorus-sorption-properties-in-hydromorphic-soils-consequences-for-p-losses-in-agricultural-landscapes&quot;&gt;Variability of phosphorus sorption properties in hydromorphic soils: Consequences for P losses in agricultural landscapes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing concerns over water eutrophication due to agricultural phosphorus (P) loss have led to the development of indicators to assess the risk of P release from agricultural soils. Recently, a logarithmic equation linking the degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS) to the simple water-soluble P (WSP) content of soils has been proposed as a universal method to assess this risk based, however, mainly on the analysis of well-drained soils. Here, we studied the P sorption properties and DPS values of 69 hydromorphic soils from cultivated and uncultivated wetland zones located in Brittany, Western France, to test whether the method could also apply to poorly-drained soils. The bulk soil analysis showed that P contents of the studied hydromorphic soils were 30% to 80% higher than P contents normally found in Brittany soils, evidencing a possible P enrichment process. Adsorption isotherms revealed a surprisingly high variability in the P sorption properties as a function of the location of the soil (maximum P adsorption capacity ranging from 500 to 1850 mg kg(-1)), which is caused by variations in the phases controlling P sorption in soil (from clay to organic matter and/or iron and aluminium oxides, depending on the soil location). Distinct relationships between DPS and WSP values were also obtained depending on the location of the soils. The obtained DPS versus WSP relationships showed that the P saturation threshold above which the risk of dissolved P release increases markedly is 30% lower on average for hydromorphic soils than for well-drained soils. Hydromorphic soils appear to be more at risk of releasing dissolved P at the same DPS values than well-drained soils. The present study indicates an underestimation of the P release risk from hydromorphic soils by the existing method developed for well-drained soils and calls for the development of specific risk assessment tools for hydromorphic soils, especially given on the strong spatial heterogeneity of their P sorption properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-web-based-system-for-satellite-based-high-resolution-global-soil-moisture-maps&quot;&gt;A web-based system for satellite-based high-resolution global soil moisture maps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, a wide range of applications require near-real-time Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) data at high spatial resolution. However, operational passive microwave systems like SMOS and SMAP can only acquire such information at a relatively coarser resolution. Therefore, several downscaling algorithms have been developed to address this issue and provide SSM maps at a finer spatial scale. Users may, however, find it difficult to implement the downscaling algorithm due to the complexity of integrating various data sources. Disaggregation based on Physical and Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) is one of the algorithms that is widely accepted to downscale passive microwave SSM observations. But the complexity of modeling, the variety of data sources and formats of input data make it very difficult for users to implement the algorithm. Thus, we developed a Satellitebased Hydrological Monitoring System (SHMS), which facilitates this gap through the implementation of the DisPATCh algorithm to generate large-scale SSM maps with high resolution, which is achieved by combining SMAP and MODIS products. The System Usability Scale (SUS) method was used to evaluate the system’s strengths and weaknesses. The SUS evaluation results show that 74.75% of SHMS users are satisfied with the system’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benchmarking-downscaled-satellite-based-soil-moisture-products-using-sparse-point-scale-ground-observations&quot;&gt;Benchmarking downscaled satellite-based soil moisture products using sparse, point-scale ground observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While strides have been made in their accuracy and availability, the overall utility of satellite-derived surface soil moisture (SM) datasets derived from passive microwave radiometry is still reduced by their relatively coarse spatial resolution (typically &amp;gt;30 km). In response to this shortcoming, many independent satellite-based SM downscaling approaches have been introduced recently. However, owing to limitations in the spatial sampling characteristics of existing SM ground-monitoring networks, it has proven difficult to obtain reliable reference SM observations at the target downscaling resolution for these approaches (typically 1 to 10 km). As a result, the objective evaluation of SM downscaling approaches is often challenging and/or limited to very localized conditions. Here, we introduce and evaluate a point-scale downscaling (PSD) benchmarking strategy whereby spatially sparse, long-term, point-scale SM observations available from existing ground-based SM networks are utilized for the objective benchmarking of downscaled satellite-based SM products. First, we define criteria that must be met for a given SM downscaling strategy to add either temporal accuracy or spatial skill relative to its coarse-resolution SM baseline. Next, we illustrate, both analytically and numerically, that such criteria can be accurately evaluated using sparse, point-scale SM observations available from existing ground-based SM networks. Finally, we apply our new PSD benchmarking approach to evaluate existing fine-scale SM products. Results demonstrate that the PSD approach, in concert with existing ground-based network data, can be leveraged to robustly evaluate SM downscaling approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warming-reduces-global-agricultural-production-by-decreasing-cropping-frequency-and-yields&quot;&gt;Warming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual food caloric production is the product of caloric yield, cropping frequency (CF, number of production seasons per year) and cropland area. Existing studies have largely focused on crop yield, whereas how CF responds to climate change remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the global climate sensitivity of caloric yields and CF at national scale. We find a robust negative association between warming and both caloric yield and CF. By the 2050s, projected CF increases in cold regions are offset by larger decreases in warm regions, resulting in a net global CF reduction (-4.2 +/- 2.5% in high emission scenario), suggesting that climate-driven decline in CF will exacerbate crop production loss and not provide climate adaptation alone. Although irrigation is effective in offsetting the projected production loss, irrigation areas have to be expanded by &amp;gt;5% in warm regions to fully offset climate-induced production losses by the 2050s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change will impact agriculture, and this study shows cropping frequency and caloric yield are negatively impacted on the global scale by warming. While cold regions will increase cropping frequency, warm regions will see greater decreases, resulting in an overall decline in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tipping-points-of-marine-phytoplankton-to-multiple-environmental-stressors&quot;&gt;Tipping points of marine phytoplankton to multiple environmental stressors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors establish machine learning models to identify multifactor tipping points of global marine phytoplankton. They show that temperature and carbon dioxide dominate risks, and project crossing tipping points in tropical area production (50%) and resistance (41%) by 2100 under high emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, anthropogenic climate change is threatening marine species. However, whether and how global marine phytoplankton, which represent the base of marine food webs, will exceed their tipping points under multiple climate factors remain unclear. Here, by establishing machine learning models, we identified the tipping points of global marine phytoplankton production and resistance under eight environmental stressors. Phytoplankton production and resistance are affected by multiple factors and the temperature and partial pressure of carbon dioxide dominate the risks for reaching their tipping points. If the current emission scenario continues, 50% (40-61% at 90% confidence) and 41% (2-80% at 90% confidence) of tropical areas would reach the tipping points of ongoing phytoplankton production and resistance decline, respectively, in 2100. Compared with single- or few-factor studies, machine learning (for example, ensemble machine learning) provides a powerful and realistic solution for policy-makers facing large-scale ecological responses to global climate changes under multiple environmental stressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fusion-of-gamma-rays-and-portable-x-ray-fluorescence-spectral-data-to-measure-extractable-potassium-in-soils&quot;&gt;Fusion of Gamma-rays and portable X-ray fluorescence spectral data to measure extractable potassium in soils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detection and mapping of plant-extractable potassium (K-a) using proximal soil sensing and data fusion (DF) techniques are essential to optimise K2O fertiliser application, improve crop yield, and minimise environmental and financial costs. This work evaluates the potential of combined use of portable gamma ray and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy for in field detection and mapping of K-a. After subjected to various pre-processing methods, spectral data were split into calibration (75%) and validation (25%) sets, and single sensor and DF models were developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR). Maps of Ka were used to present spatial variability of potassium across an 8.4 ha Voor de Hoeves target field, in Flanders, Belgium. Results showed that the gamma-ray PLSR model using wet soils had greater predictive ability with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.71, ratio of performance deviation (RPD) = 1.89, root mean square error (RMSE) = 31.7 mg kg(-1), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) = 2.36 than the corresponding wet-XRF PLSR model (R-2 = 0.61, RPD = 1.64, RMSE = 48.8 mg kg(-1) and RPIQ = 1.84). The DF PLSR model on wet soils, resulted in a more accurate Ka predictive ability (R-2 = 0.75, RPD = 2.03, RMSE = 31.3 mg kg(-1) and RPIQ = 2.79), compared to the individual gamma ray or XRF sensors in wet soils. The best accuracy was obtained with XRF spectrometer using dry samples (R-2 = 0.77, RPD = 2.14, RMSE = 26.5 mg kg(-1) and RPIQ = 3.39). All Ka prediction maps showed spatial similarity to the corresponding measured maps in the target field. In conclusion, since DF increased the Ka prediction accuracy compared to the single sensor models using wet soils, it is recommended to be adopted in future studies as a potential solution for Ka measurement, mapping, and ultimately for site-specific K2O fertilisation management. The XRF analysis of dry spectra is recommended as the best method for accurate measurement of K-a.&lt;/p&gt;
