&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Spectroscopy has been used for rapid determination of soil physicochemical parameters and soil classification or allocation, usually at the great group level of soil genetic classification. Soil genetic classification is still the main system of classification used in China, on which the Chinese Soil Classification System is based, and includes order, suborder, great group, subgroup, genus, species, and subspecies. In this paper, we introduce a soil allocation model that uses topsoil spectral characteristics and determined the minimum level for soil allocation. The topsoil spectra of four typical soils from the Songnen Plain in Northeast China were used to extract spectral feature parameters (SFPs) with clear physical meaning for soil allocation at the great group, genus, and species levels, and principal components of reflectance and first-derivative reflectance were used for allocation to determine the optimal input. Multinomial logistic regression MLR, multi-layer percepti
 on neural network, MLPNN, and decision trees (DT) were used to build allocation models. The results show the following: 1) the first and second absorption valleys of the topsoil spectral curves are substantially different between soils at the great group and genus levels but similar at the species level; 2) the topsoil samples can be allocated with SFPs, for which genus is the minimum level within the Chinese Soil Classification System for soil allocation with topsoil hyperspectral reflectance; and 3) the DT model with SFPs as input is the most accurate at the genus level; the accuracy of allocation is 83.3% and the Kappa coefficient, an evaluation index, is 0.8. Our results suggest that soil allocations using topsoil hyperspectral reflectance can be performed accurately at genus level of classification, which can be of considerable help in research on the effects of soil minerals on soil spectral characteristics and in detailed soil mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Semi-stabilized dune systems are important indicators of Quaternary drought variability across central North America. The South Texas sand sheet (STSS) is the southernmost relict dune system on the Great Plains, and is exposed to higher evapotranspiration and moisture variability than similar landscapes farther north. In this study, a combination of surface and sub-surface remote sensing is used to analyze the semi-stabilized dune landscapes of the STSS in order to delineate distinct aeolian sediments that can represent generations of sedimentation or particular climate conditions. The combination of multi-resolution analysis of a LiDAR dataset, electromagnetic conductivity surveys, and XRF scans of soil cores are shown to be useful tools for deconstructing and modeling the environmental history of the STSS. Optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of identified surfaces suggests that the STSS is older than previously thought. Since dune systems are excellent repositori
 es of climate and biophysical data for a landscape, and are also sensitive to changes in climate and ecology, the methodology employed in this study can be used to characterize the vulnerability of other similar environments to climate change through the Holocene and over the next century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Visible and near-infrared (Vis NIR) spectroscopy is used to estimate soil organic matter (SOM). Spectral preprocessing techniques and multivariate modeling methods play important roles in the quantitative analysis of SOM. First and second derivatives (i.e., the conventional integer order derivatives) are commonly used spectral derivatives, which, however, may ignore some detailed spectral information regarding SOM. Here, we presented a fractional order derivative (FOD) method to preprocess the reflectance spectra. Robust modeling methods are still required for accurate estimation of SOM. Local modeling technique (memory-based learning, MBL) was introduced to compare with two global modeling approaches, namely, partial least square (PIS) and random forest (RF). A total of 535 topsoil samples were gathered from Hubei Province, Central China, with their reflectance spectra and SOM contents measured in the laboratory. FOD was allowed to vary from 0 to 2 with an increment of 0.25 
 at each step. Coefficient of determination (R-2) and ratio of the performance to deviation (RPD) were employed as performance statistics during validation. Results showed that with the increase of derivative order, the baseline drifts and overlapping peaks were gradually removed but the spectral strength decreased concurrently. Higher derivative order reflectance (i.e., 1.5-order, 1.75-order, and 2-order reflectance) were more susceptible to spectral noise interferences. The correlation coefficient of SOM with FOD processed spectra at some specific wavelengths was larger than that with the original reflectance. MBL performed better than PLS and RF, regardless of FOD transformation. Calibration with 0.25-order reflectance and MBL provided the most accurate estimation of SOM, with an RPD of 2.23. Our results confirm the effectiveness of FOD and local modeling (MBL) in the development of Vis NIR models for SOM estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Agricultural activity evolution during the second half 20th century has profoundly changed agricultural landscapes in western Europe. Numerous scientific studies have shown that the consequences on erosive runoff processes are important. This study aims show one of the important consequences of these transformations that is the structural connectivity between cultivated plots and the river. The study is based on the analysis of aerial images taken at four different dates (1947, 1967, 1988 and 2014) and on the use of the LASCAR (LAndscape StruCture And Runoff) multi-agent model. It shows how agricultural landscapes have evolved over the past 70 years and how this has altered the connectivity of cultivated plots to the river. In addition to the development of spatial analysis indices, the results of this study offer key understandings relevant to all spatial scales (global to local). The study was carried out on a small agricultural watershed in the northwest of France (Lingevr
 es, 17.6 km(2)), whose recent landscape evolution is part of the overall dynamics of northwest French agricultural landscapes transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Dryland ecosystems are characterised by rainfall variability and strong vegetation response to changes in water availability over a range of timescales. Forecasting dryland vegetation condition can be of great value in planning agricultural decisions, drought relief, land management and fire preparedness. At monthly to seasonal time scales, knowledge of water stored in the system contributes more to predictability than knowledge of the climate system state. However, realising forecast skill requires knowledge of the vertical distribution of moisture below the surface and the capacity of the vegetation to access this moisture. Here, we demonstrate that contrasting satellite observations of water presence over different vertical domains can be assimilated into an eco-hydrological model and combined with vegetation observations to infer an apparent vegetation-accessible water storage (hereafter called accessible storage). Provided this variable is considered explicitly, skilful 
 forecasts of vegetation condition are achievable several months in advance for most of the world’s drylands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Connectivity describes the efficiency of material transfer between geomorphic system components such as hillslopes and rivers or longitudinal segments within a river network. Representations of geomorphic systems as networks should recognize that the compartments, links, and nodes exhibit connectivity at differing scales. The historical underpinnings of connectivity in geomorphology involve management of geomorphic systems and observations linking surface processes to landform dynamics. Current work in geomorphic connectivity emphasizes hydrological, sediment, or landscape connectivity. Signatures of connectivity can be detected using diverse indicators that vary from contemporary processes to stratigraphic records or a spatial metric such as sediment yield that encompasses geomorphic processes operating over diverse time and space scales. One approach to measuring connectivity is to determine the fundamental temporal and spatial scales for the phenomenon of interest and to m
 ake measurements at a sufficiently large multiple of the fundamental scales to capture reliably a representative sample. Another approach seeks to characterize how connectivity varies with scale, by applying the same metric over a wide range of scales or using statistical measures that characterize the frequency distributions of connectivity across scales. Identifying and measuring connectivity is useful in basic and applied geomorphic research and we explore the implications of connectivity for river management. Common themes and ideas that merit further research include; increased understanding of the importance of capturing landscape heterogeneity and connectivity patterns; the potential to use graph and network theory metrics in analyzing connectivity; the need to understand which metrics best represent the physical system and its connectivity pathways, and to apply these metrics to the validation of numerical models; and the need to recognize the importance of low level
 s of connectivity in some situations. We emphasize the value!
  in evaluating boundaries between components of geomorphic systems as transition zones and examining the fluxes across them to understand landscape functioning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Understanding natural soil redistribution processes is essential for measuring the anthropogenic impact on landscapes. Although meteoric beryllium-10 (Be-10) has been used to determine erosion processes within the Pleistocene and Holocene, fewer studies have used the isotope to investigate the transport and accumulation of the resulting sediment. Here we use meteoric Be-10 in hilltop and valley site soil profiles to determine sediment erosion and deposition processes in the Christina River Basin (Pennsylvania, USA). The data indicate natural erosion rates of 14 to 21 mm 10(-3) yr and soil ages of 26 000 to 57 000 years in hilltop sites. Furthermore, valley sites indicate an alteration in sediment supply due to climate change (from the Pleistocene to the Holocene) within the last 60 000 years and sediment deposition of at least 0.5-2 m during the Wisconsinan glaciation. The change in soil erosion rate was most likely induced by changes in geomorphic processes; probably soliflu
 ction and slope wash during the cold period, when ice advanced into the mid latitudes of North America. This study shows the value of using meteoric Be-10 to determine sediment accumulation within the Quaternary and quantifies major soil redistribution occurred under natural conditions in this region&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The aim of this study was to develop a new soil multi-sensor fusion by combining mechanical, dielectric and acoustic responses in layered soils for estimation of soil water content, degree of compactness and texture. The load cell, dielectric and acoustic sensors were integrated on a 25 mm diameter, 45-deg conical probe. Functioning of the dielectric sensor is based on the fringe-field between the two adjacent ring electrodes. Passive acoustic responses (emissions) at high frequency (10-350 kHz) were measured using an acoustic emission (AE) piezo sensor during probe penetration into the layered soil. The AE sensor was installed inside the cone (close to the cone tip) to receive passive AEs originating at the cone-soil interface and between soil particles surrounding the moving probe. The multi-sensor probe was evaluated using laboratory vertical penetration tests in various layered soil columns consisting of three soil types: clay, loam and sand. Each soil texture was prepare
 d at three soil water contents (0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 x lower plastic limit) and remolded at three bulk densities (1.25, 1.4 and 1.55 Mg m(-3)) in the column. The acoustic frequency distribution spectra clearly distinguished the sandy soil texture (irrespective of bulk density and water content) from the clay and loam soil textures, with a relatively poor discrimination between clay and loam soil. The results indicate that the dielectric sensor output is highly correlated to soil volumetric water content (R-2 = 0.78, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.025 m(3) m(-3)) with a minor effect of bulk density. Data fusion of mechanical, dielectric and acoustic sensors significantly improved the measurement of soil water content (R-2 = 0.93, MAE = 0.014 m(3) m(-3)). Degree of soil compactness was well predicted from data fusion of the three sensors (R-2 = 0.80, MAE = 3.32%). Therefore, the multi-sensor probe developed in this study is an economical and viable instrument that shows promising p
 otential for in-situ use in soil physical characterization. !
 Laboratory and field evaluations to further examine the sensor for practical applications, such as on-the-go soil physical sensing in precision agriculture, are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Tillage operations are a vital part of agricultural crop production. Economic and environmental considerations are forcing farmers to manage soil tillage with optimum tool configurations to get the desirable soil condition. Soil disturbance caused by soil engaging tools, in particular soil layer mixing, is an important phenomenon that needs to be clearly understood. Current methods used to investigate soil layer mixing are limited, especially when multiple layer mixing needs to be investigated. The use of physical tracers is the most common approach. Although this method can provide some useful information, since it does not provide a full representation of how soil layers are moving or mixing, error-prone rough estimation is unavoidable. In this study, the mixing of soil layers was investigated using different coloured sands placed in layers at different depths (to continuously investigate the soil layer mixing). A new colour clustering algorithm to analyse such multi-colour
 ed layer mixing performance was developed using K-means clustering with a PCA (principal component analysis) approach. The validation study of the proposed algorithm was conducted using the Columbia multispectral image database before implementation on the experimental coloured soil test. The test results showed that the proposed method and algorithm is effective in analysing multiple soil layer mixing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Improved soil management is increasingly pursued to ensure food security for the world’s rising global population, with the ancillary benefit of storing carbon in soils to lower the threat of climate change. While all increments to soil organic matter are laudable, we suggest caution in ascribing large, potential climate change mitigation to enhanced soil management. We find that the most promising techniques, including applications of biochar and enhanced silicate weathering, collectively are not likely to balance more than 5% of annual emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Complex systems can have tipping points where the system behavior changes abruptly from one regime to another. We develop an ecological-economic model that simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of the land-use induced by a tradable permit market and its consequences on the viability of a model species. The model analysis reveals that the land-use dynamics are subject to a tipping point with regard to changes in policy scheme design. One the level of species viability, this tipping point is amplified and a second tipping point emerges. The two tipping points interact and their location and sharpness depend on the characteristics of the species. We conclude that in the consideration of coupled ecological-economic systems tipping points can play an important role. The existence of tipping points considerably complicates the design of policy instruments for the sustainable management of ecological-economic systems because a small change in the policy design can have dramatic con
 sequences on the system dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We study the biodiversity problem for resource competition systems with extinctions and self-limitation effects. Our main result establishes estimates of biodiversity in terms of the fundamental parameters of the model. We also prove the global stability of solutions for systems with extinctions and large turnover rate. We show that when the extinction threshold is distinct from zero, the large time dynamics of system is fundamentally nonpredictable. In the last part of the paper we obtain explicit analytical estimates of ecosystem robustness with respect to variations of resource supply which support the R* rule for a system with random parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The importance of environmental heterogeneity for biodiversity across scales is widely recognized in ecological theory and profusely supported by evidence. However, our understanding of the effects of spatiotemporal patterns of landscape functional properties on biodiversity is still rather limited. We examined the relationship between common passerine species richness and ecosystem functioning dynamics, namely seasonality, measured by satellite remote sensing. We focused on rural landscapes of a mountain National Park in Portugal undergoing rapid reshaping from agro-pastoral mosaics to early successional landscapes. We applied multi-model inference to compare the hypothesis of landscape seasonality as a driver of species richness with three competing hypotheses representing structural habitat heterogeneity, disturbance, and availability of food resources. We found support for landscape seasonality and its spatial heterogeneity in explaining passerine richness in mountain rur
 al landscapes. Conversely, no significant support of the remaining hypotheses was found. These results highlight the role of ecosystem functioning variability in space and time. They also stress the importance of considering species-energy relationships for conservation at the landscape level. Specifically, they provide support and guidance to the identification of meaningful functional attributes of the landscape that shape its biodiversity. Our results further demonstrate the utility of remote sensing approaches and products to measure those attributes and follow their trends through time. Spatially-explicit measures of energy variability, such as the functional amplitude between winter and summer retrieved from earth observations, can link global socio-environmental change to species’ responses and support the inclusion of landscape seasonality on conservation and monitoring frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This study dynamically analyzes the trade-off between three ecosystem services (ESs), including soil retention, habitat quality, and food supply in the Gorganrood watershed, northeastern Iran. In this regard, several analytic tools including the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoff (InVEST) model, Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-MC) model, Intensity Analysis and Trade-Off (TO) index are employed to dynamically link the process of land use change with the temporal flow of ESs. Two scenarios of business as usual (BAU) and environmentally sound planning (ESP) are developed to produce land use layers under various planning strategies. Accordingly, the BAU scenario is more successful at providing a landscape with a higher acreage of agricultural fields and rangelands. Based on tradeoff index results, the BAU scenario establishes a landscape in which food supply is intensified by declining land capability for providing soil retention and habitat quality servic
 es. In contrast, the ESP scenario generates a landscape in which the outputs of the TO index indicate that habitat quality and soil retention benefits are improved by decreasing the potential of the area to supply food. This study emphasizes that a dynamic trade-off analysis of multiple ESs can assist planners and policy makers to make informed decisions and undertake strategic planning in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Sampling the full diversity of interactions in an ecological community is a highly intensive effort. Recent studies have demonstrated that many network metrics are sensitive to both sampling effort and network size. Here, we develop a statistical framework, based on bootstrap resampling, that aims to assess sampling sufficiency for some of the most widely used metrics in Network Ecology, namely connectance, nestedness (NODF- nested overlap and decreasing fill) and modularity (using the QuaBiMo algorithm). Our framework can generate confidence intervals for each network metric with increasing sample size (i.e., the number of sampled interaction events, or number of sampled individuals), which can be used to evaluate sampling sufficiency. The sample is considered sufficient when the confidence limits reach stability or lie within an acceptable level of precision for the aims of the study. We illustrate our framework with data from three quantitative networks of plant and frugiv
 orous birds, varying in size from 16 to 115 species, and 17 to 2,745 interactions. The results show that, for the same dataset, sampling sufficiency may be reached at different sample sizes depending on the metric of interest. The bootstrap confidence limits reached stability for the two largest networks, but were wide and unstable with increasing sample size for all three metrics estimated for the smallest network. The bootstrap method is useful to empirical ecologists to indicate the minimum number of interactions necessary to reach sampling sufficiency for a specific network metric. It is also useful to compare sampling techniques of networks in their capacity to reach sampling sufficiency. Our method is general enough to be applied to different types of metrics and networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil organic carbon (SOC) measurement is critically important to quantify regional and global soil C stocks and better understand soil C biogeochemical processes. Recent studies employing laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and visible-near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) indicate their potential for in situ soil C determination. Visible and near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and LIBS spectroscopy fundamentally differ and we hypothesize that their integration would provide improved soil C predictions. We report the first rigorous integration of vis-NIRS and LIBS, evaluating the precision of vis-NIRS, LIBS, and combined vis-NIRS-LIBS spectra for simulated in situ soil profile total C (TC), inorganic C (IC) and SOC measurement. Three multivariate variable selection and regression approaches were evaluated for soil C prediction. The highest soil C prediction accuracies were observed using multivariate regression with covariance estimation
  (MRCE). Inorganic C was best predicted by LIBS, vis-NIRS provided better SOC predictions, and TC was best predicted using combined vis-NIRS-LIBS data. Combined vis-NIRS-LIBS did not consistently increase soil C prediction accuracy. Soil organic C was not well predicted, presumably due to challenges associated with scanning surfaces of intact soil cores, variable SOC chemistries, and low SOC variation in the dataset. Considering the challenging conditions under which combined vis-NIRS-LIBS was tested for soil C measurement, data integration and model calibrations had acceptable performance. Further testing under more controlled soil conditions with samples containing greater SOC diversity is necessary to determine the technical potential of combined vis-NIRS/LIBS for soil C determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Flotation tests at laboratory scale describe the metallurgical behavior of the minerals that will be processed in the operational plant. This material is generally composed of ore and gangue minerals. These tests are usually scarce, expensive and sampled in large supports. This research proposes a methodology for the geostatistical modelling of metallurgical recovery, covering the change of support problems through additive auxiliary variables. The methodology consists of simulating these auxiliary variables using a Gibbs Sampler in order to infer the behavior of samples with smaller supports. This allows downscaling a large sample measurement into smaller ones, reproducing the variability at different scales considering the physical restrictions of additivity balance of the metallurgical recovery process. As a consequence, it is possible to apply conventional multivariate geostatistical tools to data at different supports, such as multivariable exploratory analysis, calculat
 ion of cross-variograms, multivariate estimations, among others. The methodology was tested using a drillhole database from an ore deposit, modelling recovery at a smaller support than that of the metallurgical tests. The support allowed for the use of the geochemical database, to consistently model the metal content in the feed and in the concentrate, in order to obtain a valid recovery model. Results show that downscaling the composite size reduces smoothing in the final model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Ore deposits usually consist of ore materials with different discrete (e.g. rock and alteration types) and continuous (e.g. geochemical and mineral composition) features. Financial feasibility studies are highly dependent on the modelling of these features and their associated joint uncertainties. Few geostatistical techniques have been developed for the joint modelling of high-dimensional mixed data (continuous and categorical) or constrained data, such as compositional data. The compositional nature of the mineral and geochemical data induces several challenges for multivariate geostatistical techniques, because such data carry relative information and are known for spurious statistical and spatial correlation effects. This paper investigates the application of the direct sampling algorithm for joint modelling of compositional and categorical data. In some mining projects the amount of available data may be enormous in some parts of the deposit and if the density of measure
 ments is sufficient, multivariate geospatial patterns can be derived from that data and be simulated (without model inference) at other undersampled areas of the deposit with similar characteristics. In this context, the direct sampling multiple-point simulation method can be implemented for this reconstruction process. The compositional nature of the data is addressed via implementing an isometric log-ratio transformation. The approach is illustrated through two case studies, one synthetic and one real. The accuracy of the results is checked against a set of validation data, revealing the potential of the proposed methodology for joint modelling of compositional and categorical information. The direct sampling technique can be considered as a smart move to assess the future risk and uncertainty of a resource by making use of all the information hidden within the early data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited f
 or information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The western U.S. is expected to experience more frequent and severe droughts as a result of climate change, with potentially large impacts on agricultural production and the economy. Irrigated farmers have multiple options for minimizing the impact of drought including switching to more efficient irrigation technologies. More efficient technologies that increase the fraction of the water available to the crop root zone would allow farmers to maintain current production levels with less water. However, these systems are capital intensive. The objective of this study is to explore when (and under what climatic conditions) it makes economic sense for farmers to invest in new irrigation systems. We examine this in the Yakima River Basin in Washington State of the U.S. We use VIC-CropSyst, a large-scale grid-based modeling framework that mechanistically simulates hydrologic and agricultural processes. Water supply simulated by VIC-CropSyst drives a river system and water managemen
 t model (YAK-RW). A computational platform was developed to perform the economic analysis for each grid cell, crop type, and future climate scenario separately, which allowed us to explore whether the implementation of more efficient irrigation systems would be economically viable. Our results indicate that investing in a more efficient irrigation system improves agricultural economy of the Yakima River Basin (9% -25%). We also show that at the farm level, more significant droughts can provide economic incentives for investment up to a point. For severe climate change projections, droughts become frequent and severe enough that economic benefits of improving water use efficiency do not exceed investment costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The consistent determination of soil moisture across scales is a persistent challenge in hydrology. Several measurement methods exist at distinct scales, each of which is challenging in terms of data processing, removal of vegetation and surface effects, and calibration. While in situ measurements are trusted at the point scale, distributed sensor networks extend the areal representation to the field scale. At this scale, also cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an established method to derive volume-averaged, root zone soil moisture over several tens of hectometers, but the signal is often biased due to biomass water. With airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)remote sensing, it is possible to cover regional scales, but the method is limited to the topmost soil layer and sensitive to vegetation parameters. In this study, the performance and synergistic potential of these complementary methods is investigated for the determination of soil moisture within a 55-km(2) 
 Alpine foothill river catchment in Southern Germany. The individual approaches are evaluated and brought into synergy for a 9-ha grassland and several other locations within the catchment. The results indicate that the sensor network data provide valuable information to calibrate the mobile CRNS rover, and to optimize the vegetation removal within the polarimetric SAR retrieval algorithm. The root-mean-square errors for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar soil permittivity are 9.32 with the standard agriculture approach, 4.29 with the semi-stand-alone approach, and 0.31 with the sensor network optimized approach. Furthermore, the CRNS soil moisture product was improved by considering the remotely sensed cross-polarized backscatter product as a biomass water proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Environmental modelers using optimization algorithms for model calibration face an ambivalent choice. Some algorithms, for example, Newton-type methods, are fast but struggle to consistently find global parameter optima; other algorithms, for example, evolutionary methods, boast better global convergence but at much higher cost (e.g., requiring more objective function calls). Trade-offs between accuracy/robustness versus cost are ubiquitous in numerical computation, yet environmental modeling studies have lacked a systematic framework for quantifying these trade-offs. This study develops a framework for benchmarking stochastic optimization algorithms in the context of environmental model calibration, where multiple algorithm invocations are typically necessary. We define reliability as the probability of finding the desired (global or tolerable) optimum from random initial points and estimate the number of invocations to find the desired optimum with prescribed confidence (he
 re 95%). A robust algorithm should achieve consistently high reliability across many problems. A characteristic efficiency metric for algorithm benchmarking is defined as the total cost (objective function calls over multiple invocations) to find the desired optimum with prescribed confidence. This approach avoids the pitfalls of existing approaches that compare costs without controlling the confidence in algorithm success. A case study illustrates the framework by benchmarking the Levenberg-Marquardt and Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithms over three catchments and four hydrological models. In 8 of 12 scenarios, Levenberg-Marquardt is more efficient than SCEby sacrificing some of its speed advantage to match SCE reliability through more invocations. The proposed framework is easy to apply and can help guide algorithm selection in environmental model calibration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The spatial and temporal variability in soil moisture modulates runoff generation and the degree of land-atmosphere coupling. Numerous statistical and modeling approaches have been implemented to characterize soil moisture spatial heterogeneity at fine spatial resolution using data from sparse observational networks or distributed model simulations. This characterization has been subsequently employed to translate coarse model simulations (of the order of a few hundred meters or kilometers) to finer spatial scales for a range of ensuing applications that rely on high-resolution characterization of soil moisture. One common feature of these disaggregation methods is that the impact of soil moisture memory is ignored. This results in both spatial and temporal persistence being poorly simulated, leading to poorer specifications of cropping and irrigation plans. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed a hybrid disaggregation method that uses the first-order autoregressive mode
 l (AR1) constructed from fine-resolution (60m) soil moisture simulations to disaggregate catchment mean soil moisture obtained from remote sensing or semidistributed model simulations. Soil moisture simulations from an integrated land surface-groundwater model, ParFlow-Common Land Model in Baldry subcatchment, Australia, are used as virtual observations. We examined the AR1 method performance against topographic wetness index-based methods and those developed from temporal stability method. Results illustrate that the disaggregation schemes calibrated to a 10-day fine-scale model simulation perform better than the topographic-based methods in approximating soil moisture distribution at a 60-m resolution in the catchment. Furthermore, the AR1 model is the best model (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE]&amp;gt;0.45) among various alternatives explored here. Applying the hybrid univariate AR1 model is promising for disaggregating semidistributed models’ soil moisture simulations while sig
 nificantly reducing the computational time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This article considers the evolution of the use of the Munsell system for assessing soil color. In the 1920s, Munsell color disks were recommended for soil color measurement. Munsell soil color charts (MSCs) were introduced in the 1940s. In 1942, the American Standards Association recommended that spectrophotometers be used for quantitative measurements and the Munsell system be used only for the psychological characterization of color. Despite this recommendation, soil scientists have continued using MSCs to measure soil color semi-quantitatively.ve color was measured with a spectrophotometer. Chip colors were compared using the CIELAB color difference (Delta E-ab&lt;em&gt;). To examine ambiguity, we calculated the Delta E-ab&lt;/em&gt; for every possible MSC color chip pair. Considerable ambiguity was found; 60% of the chips had duplicates. Chips were considered duplicates if the color difference was barely perceptible visually (Delta E-ab* &amp;lt; 3).To investigate adequacy, the color difference b
 etween 161 soil samples and their closest MSC chips was calculated. Only 52% of the samples had Delta E-ab* &amp;lt; 3. This indicated that the color range of the MSC does not adequately cover the range of natural soil colors.To study the reliability of MSCs, an old and a new MSC were compared. The identically designated chips in the old and new MSC generally had color differences of less than 3. Only 16% had Delta E-ab* &amp;gt; 3. In addition, chips within a chart or even within a sheet can fade over time in a non-uniform way. On the 2.5Y sheet, a stable group of color chips (similar to 63%) occurred. This stable group consisted of the chips that were the least prone to discoloration (Delta E-ab* &amp;lt; 3).This study determined that the inadequacy and ambiguity of MSCs can be overcome by using MSCs in combination with flatbed scanners. MSCs can be used to calibrate flatbed scanners for the purpose of soil color measurement. A procedure is proposed. The procedure calibrates the scanner using 
 7 chips from the stable group of the 2.5Y sheet. This proced!
 ure enables the measurement of soil color inexpensively and efficiently. The high efficiency of the method was confirmed by testing the accuracy of the soil color determinations for 20 soil samples, covering a wide color range. The calibration procedure quadruples the precision of color estimation compared to solely using MSCs and results in soil color measurements close to those achievable with spectrophotometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Global population growth drives the increase in demand for water and food. Consequently, there is a build-up of pressure for land use for agricultural production, creating the necessity of sacrificing areas previously occupied by the native land cover to create production areas. However, globally, the possibilities of agricultural frontier expansion are limited, and agricultural expansion activities conducted without adequate planning can accelerate the erosive processes that decrease the potential land production capability. In an attempt to attenuate environmental imbalances, payment for ecosystem services (PES) programmes have been created, highlighting the possibility of their being applied in the agricultural sector. This study developed a methodology for PES that follows the basic principles of the land use capability classification system proposed by the United States Department of Agriculture. However, the study aimed to make the classification process operational in 
 a way that notes the conditions in which a rural property maintains its production capability without jeopardizing its environmental role. In this way, it is possible to evaluate whether a rural property is suitable to receive PES. To detail the steps for applying the methodology, a case study was conducted on a rural property in the town of Itabira, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Assessments of land capability for particular functions such as food production need to allow for uncertainties both in the criteria used to specify the function and in information on relevant soil properties. In this paper, we evaluate the use of digital soil assessment (DSA) for dynamic assessment of soil capability allowing for both uncertainties and spatial variability in soil properties and flexibility in the values of assessment criteria. We do this for soil constraints to rice production in the state of Punjab, India, where soil salinity and alkalinity are potentially important constraints to cropping. In DSA, spatial predictions of soil properties and associated uncertainties made with digital soil mapping (DSM) are used to assess soil functions. We use a combination of DSM and Monte Carlo simulation methods to estimate the spatial variation in soil electrical conductivity (ECe) and pH to 20 cm depth in soils across Punjab. We then use the estimates and associated unc
 ertainties to assess the likelihood that soil salinity or alkalinity or both could constrain rice production. Results show that allowing for prediction uncertainties of soil attributes results in far smaller areas affected by salinity (1.2 vs. 2.0 Mha) and alkalinity (3.0 vs. 3.2 Mha). Results also show the importance of correctly setting threshold values for constraint criteria and the flexibility of the DSA approach for setting thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Complex systems can have tipping points where the system behavior changes abruptly from one regime to another. We develop an ecological-economic model that simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of the land-use induced by a tradable permit market and its consequences on the viability of a model species. The model analysis reveals that the land-use dynamics are subject to a tipping point with regard to changes in policy scheme design. One the level of species viability, this tipping point is amplified and a second tipping point emerges. The two tipping points interact and their location and sharpness depend on the characteristics of the species. We conclude that in the consideration of coupled ecological-economic systems tipping points can play an important role. The existence of tipping points considerably complicates the design of policy instruments for the sustainable management of ecological-economic systems because a small change in the policy design can have dramatic con
 sequences on the system dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We study the biodiversity problem for resource competition systems with extinctions and self-limitation effects. Our main result establishes estimates of biodiversity in terms of the fundamental parameters of the model. We also prove the global stability of solutions for systems with extinctions and large turnover rate. We show that when the extinction threshold is distinct from zero, the large time dynamics of system is fundamentally nonpredictable. In the last part of the paper we obtain explicit analytical estimates of ecosystem robustness with respect to variations of resource supply which support the R* rule for a system with random parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The importance of environmental heterogeneity for biodiversity across scales is widely recognized in ecological theory and profusely supported by evidence. However, our understanding of the effects of spatiotemporal patterns of landscape functional properties on biodiversity is still rather limited. We examined the relationship between common passerine species richness and ecosystem functioning dynamics, namely seasonality, measured by satellite remote sensing. We focused on rural landscapes of a mountain National Park in Portugal undergoing rapid reshaping from agro-pastoral mosaics to early successional landscapes. We applied multi-model inference to compare the hypothesis of landscape seasonality as a driver of species richness with three competing hypotheses representing structural habitat heterogeneity, disturbance, and availability of food resources. We found support for landscape seasonality and its spatial heterogeneity in explaining passerine richness in mountain rur
 al landscapes. Conversely, no significant support of the remaining hypotheses was found. These results highlight the role of ecosystem functioning variability in space and time. They also stress the importance of considering species-energy relationships for conservation at the landscape level. Specifically, they provide support and guidance to the identification of meaningful functional attributes of the landscape that shape its biodiversity. Our results further demonstrate the utility of remote sensing approaches and products to measure those attributes and follow their trends through time. Spatially-explicit measures of energy variability, such as the functional amplitude between winter and summer retrieved from earth observations, can link global socio-environmental change to species’ responses and support the inclusion of landscape seasonality on conservation and monitoring frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This study dynamically analyzes the trade-off between three ecosystem services (ESs), including soil retention, habitat quality, and food supply in the Gorganrood watershed, northeastern Iran. In this regard, several analytic tools including the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoff (InVEST) model, Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-MC) model, Intensity Analysis and Trade-Off (TO) index are employed to dynamically link the process of land use change with the temporal flow of ESs. Two scenarios of business as usual (BAU) and environmentally sound planning (ESP) are developed to produce land use layers under various planning strategies. Accordingly, the BAU scenario is more successful at providing a landscape with a higher acreage of agricultural fields and rangelands. Based on tradeoff index results, the BAU scenario establishes a landscape in which food supply is intensified by declining land capability for providing soil retention and habitat quality servic
 es. In contrast, the ESP scenario generates a landscape in which the outputs of the TO index indicate that habitat quality and soil retention benefits are improved by decreasing the potential of the area to supply food. This study emphasizes that a dynamic trade-off analysis of multiple ESs can assist planners and policy makers to make informed decisions and undertake strategic planning in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Sampling the full diversity of interactions in an ecological community is a highly intensive effort. Recent studies have demonstrated that many network metrics are sensitive to both sampling effort and network size. Here, we develop a statistical framework, based on bootstrap resampling, that aims to assess sampling sufficiency for some of the most widely used metrics in Network Ecology, namely connectance, nestedness (NODF- nested overlap and decreasing fill) and modularity (using the QuaBiMo algorithm). Our framework can generate confidence intervals for each network metric with increasing sample size (i.e., the number of sampled interaction events, or number of sampled individuals), which can be used to evaluate sampling sufficiency. The sample is considered sufficient when the confidence limits reach stability or lie within an acceptable level of precision for the aims of the study. We illustrate our framework with data from three quantitative networks of plant and frugiv
 orous birds, varying in size from 16 to 115 species, and 17 to 2,745 interactions. The results show that, for the same dataset, sampling sufficiency may be reached at different sample sizes depending on the metric of interest. The bootstrap confidence limits reached stability for the two largest networks, but were wide and unstable with increasing sample size for all three metrics estimated for the smallest network. The bootstrap method is useful to empirical ecologists to indicate the minimum number of interactions necessary to reach sampling sufficiency for a specific network metric. It is also useful to compare sampling techniques of networks in their capacity to reach sampling sufficiency. Our method is general enough to be applied to different types of metrics and networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil organic carbon (SOC) measurement is critically important to quantify regional and global soil C stocks and better understand soil C biogeochemical processes. Recent studies employing laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and visible-near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) indicate their potential for in situ soil C determination. Visible and near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and LIBS spectroscopy fundamentally differ and we hypothesize that their integration would provide improved soil C predictions. We report the first rigorous integration of vis-NIRS and LIBS, evaluating the precision of vis-NIRS, LIBS, and combined vis-NIRS-LIBS spectra for simulated in situ soil profile total C (TC), inorganic C (IC) and SOC measurement. Three multivariate variable selection and regression approaches were evaluated for soil C prediction. The highest soil C prediction accuracies were observed using multivariate regression with covariance estimation
  (MRCE). Inorganic C was best predicted by LIBS, vis-NIRS provided better SOC predictions, and TC was best predicted using combined vis-NIRS-LIBS data. Combined vis-NIRS-LIBS did not consistently increase soil C prediction accuracy. Soil organic C was not well predicted, presumably due to challenges associated with scanning surfaces of intact soil cores, variable SOC chemistries, and low SOC variation in the dataset. Considering the challenging conditions under which combined vis-NIRS-LIBS was tested for soil C measurement, data integration and model calibrations had acceptable performance. Further testing under more controlled soil conditions with samples containing greater SOC diversity is necessary to determine the technical potential of combined vis-NIRS/LIBS for soil C determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Flotation tests at laboratory scale describe the metallurgical behavior of the minerals that will be processed in the operational plant. This material is generally composed of ore and gangue minerals. These tests are usually scarce, expensive and sampled in large supports. This research proposes a methodology for the geostatistical modelling of metallurgical recovery, covering the change of support problems through additive auxiliary variables. The methodology consists of simulating these auxiliary variables using a Gibbs Sampler in order to infer the behavior of samples with smaller supports. This allows downscaling a large sample measurement into smaller ones, reproducing the variability at different scales considering the physical restrictions of additivity balance of the metallurgical recovery process. As a consequence, it is possible to apply conventional multivariate geostatistical tools to data at different supports, such as multivariable exploratory analysis, calculat
 ion of cross-variograms, multivariate estimations, among others. The methodology was tested using a drillhole database from an ore deposit, modelling recovery at a smaller support than that of the metallurgical tests. The support allowed for the use of the geochemical database, to consistently model the metal content in the feed and in the concentrate, in order to obtain a valid recovery model. Results show that downscaling the composite size reduces smoothing in the final model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Ore deposits usually consist of ore materials with different discrete (e.g. rock and alteration types) and continuous (e.g. geochemical and mineral composition) features. Financial feasibility studies are highly dependent on the modelling of these features and their associated joint uncertainties. Few geostatistical techniques have been developed for the joint modelling of high-dimensional mixed data (continuous and categorical) or constrained data, such as compositional data. The compositional nature of the mineral and geochemical data induces several challenges for multivariate geostatistical techniques, because such data carry relative information and are known for spurious statistical and spatial correlation effects. This paper investigates the application of the direct sampling algorithm for joint modelling of compositional and categorical data. In some mining projects the amount of available data may be enormous in some parts of the deposit and if the density of measure
 ments is sufficient, multivariate geospatial patterns can be derived from that data and be simulated (without model inference) at other undersampled areas of the deposit with similar characteristics. In this context, the direct sampling multiple-point simulation method can be implemented for this reconstruction process. The compositional nature of the data is addressed via implementing an isometric log-ratio transformation. The approach is illustrated through two case studies, one synthetic and one real. The accuracy of the results is checked against a set of validation data, revealing the potential of the proposed methodology for joint modelling of compositional and categorical information. The direct sampling technique can be considered as a smart move to assess the future risk and uncertainty of a resource by making use of all the information hidden within the early data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited f
 or information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The western U.S. is expected to experience more frequent and severe droughts as a result of climate change, with potentially large impacts on agricultural production and the economy. Irrigated farmers have multiple options for minimizing the impact of drought including switching to more efficient irrigation technologies. More efficient technologies that increase the fraction of the water available to the crop root zone would allow farmers to maintain current production levels with less water. However, these systems are capital intensive. The objective of this study is to explore when (and under what climatic conditions) it makes economic sense for farmers to invest in new irrigation systems. We examine this in the Yakima River Basin in Washington State of the U.S. We use VIC-CropSyst, a large-scale grid-based modeling framework that mechanistically simulates hydrologic and agricultural processes. Water supply simulated by VIC-CropSyst drives a river system and water managemen
 t model (YAK-RW). A computational platform was developed to perform the economic analysis for each grid cell, crop type, and future climate scenario separately, which allowed us to explore whether the implementation of more efficient irrigation systems would be economically viable. Our results indicate that investing in a more efficient irrigation system improves agricultural economy of the Yakima River Basin (9% -25%). We also show that at the farm level, more significant droughts can provide economic incentives for investment up to a point. For severe climate change projections, droughts become frequent and severe enough that economic benefits of improving water use efficiency do not exceed investment costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The consistent determination of soil moisture across scales is a persistent challenge in hydrology. Several measurement methods exist at distinct scales, each of which is challenging in terms of data processing, removal of vegetation and surface effects, and calibration. While in situ measurements are trusted at the point scale, distributed sensor networks extend the areal representation to the field scale. At this scale, also cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an established method to derive volume-averaged, root zone soil moisture over several tens of hectometers, but the signal is often biased due to biomass water. With airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)remote sensing, it is possible to cover regional scales, but the method is limited to the topmost soil layer and sensitive to vegetation parameters. In this study, the performance and synergistic potential of these complementary methods is investigated for the determination of soil moisture within a 55-km(2) 
 Alpine foothill river catchment in Southern Germany. The individual approaches are evaluated and brought into synergy for a 9-ha grassland and several other locations within the catchment. The results indicate that the sensor network data provide valuable information to calibrate the mobile CRNS rover, and to optimize the vegetation removal within the polarimetric SAR retrieval algorithm. The root-mean-square errors for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar soil permittivity are 9.32 with the standard agriculture approach, 4.29 with the semi-stand-alone approach, and 0.31 with the sensor network optimized approach. Furthermore, the CRNS soil moisture product was improved by considering the remotely sensed cross-polarized backscatter product as a biomass water proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Environmental modelers using optimization algorithms for model calibration face an ambivalent choice. Some algorithms, for example, Newton-type methods, are fast but struggle to consistently find global parameter optima; other algorithms, for example, evolutionary methods, boast better global convergence but at much higher cost (e.g., requiring more objective function calls). Trade-offs between accuracy/robustness versus cost are ubiquitous in numerical computation, yet environmental modeling studies have lacked a systematic framework for quantifying these trade-offs. This study develops a framework for benchmarking stochastic optimization algorithms in the context of environmental model calibration, where multiple algorithm invocations are typically necessary. We define reliability as the probability of finding the desired (global or tolerable) optimum from random initial points and estimate the number of invocations to find the desired optimum with prescribed confidence (he
 re 95%). A robust algorithm should achieve consistently high reliability across many problems. A characteristic efficiency metric for algorithm benchmarking is defined as the total cost (objective function calls over multiple invocations) to find the desired optimum with prescribed confidence. This approach avoids the pitfalls of existing approaches that compare costs without controlling the confidence in algorithm success. A case study illustrates the framework by benchmarking the Levenberg-Marquardt and Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithms over three catchments and four hydrological models. In 8 of 12 scenarios, Levenberg-Marquardt is more efficient than SCEby sacrificing some of its speed advantage to match SCE reliability through more invocations. The proposed framework is easy to apply and can help guide algorithm selection in environmental model calibration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The spatial and temporal variability in soil moisture modulates runoff generation and the degree of land-atmosphere coupling. Numerous statistical and modeling approaches have been implemented to characterize soil moisture spatial heterogeneity at fine spatial resolution using data from sparse observational networks or distributed model simulations. This characterization has been subsequently employed to translate coarse model simulations (of the order of a few hundred meters or kilometers) to finer spatial scales for a range of ensuing applications that rely on high-resolution characterization of soil moisture. One common feature of these disaggregation methods is that the impact of soil moisture memory is ignored. This results in both spatial and temporal persistence being poorly simulated, leading to poorer specifications of cropping and irrigation plans. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed a hybrid disaggregation method that uses the first-order autoregressive mode
 l (AR1) constructed from fine-resolution (60m) soil moisture simulations to disaggregate catchment mean soil moisture obtained from remote sensing or semidistributed model simulations. Soil moisture simulations from an integrated land surface-groundwater model, ParFlow-Common Land Model in Baldry subcatchment, Australia, are used as virtual observations. We examined the AR1 method performance against topographic wetness index-based methods and those developed from temporal stability method. Results illustrate that the disaggregation schemes calibrated to a 10-day fine-scale model simulation perform better than the topographic-based methods in approximating soil moisture distribution at a 60-m resolution in the catchment. Furthermore, the AR1 model is the best model (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE]&amp;gt;0.45) among various alternatives explored here. Applying the hybrid univariate AR1 model is promising for disaggregating semidistributed models’ soil moisture simulations while sig
 nificantly reducing the computational time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This article considers the evolution of the use of the Munsell system for assessing soil color. In the 1920s, Munsell color disks were recommended for soil color measurement. Munsell soil color charts (MSCs) were introduced in the 1940s. In 1942, the American Standards Association recommended that spectrophotometers be used for quantitative measurements and the Munsell system be used only for the psychological characterization of color. Despite this recommendation, soil scientists have continued using MSCs to measure soil color semi-quantitatively.ve color was measured with a spectrophotometer. Chip colors were compared using the CIELAB color difference (Delta E-ab&lt;em&gt;). To examine ambiguity, we calculated the Delta E-ab&lt;/em&gt; for every possible MSC color chip pair. Considerable ambiguity was found; 60% of the chips had duplicates. Chips were considered duplicates if the color difference was barely perceptible visually (Delta E-ab* &amp;lt; 3).To investigate adequacy, the color difference b
 etween 161 soil samples and their closest MSC chips was calculated. Only 52% of the samples had Delta E-ab* &amp;lt; 3. This indicated that the color range of the MSC does not adequately cover the range of natural soil colors.To study the reliability of MSCs, an old and a new MSC were compared. The identically designated chips in the old and new MSC generally had color differences of less than 3. Only 16% had Delta E-ab* &amp;gt; 3. In addition, chips within a chart or even within a sheet can fade over time in a non-uniform way. On the 2.5Y sheet, a stable group of color chips (similar to 63%) occurred. This stable group consisted of the chips that were the least prone to discoloration (Delta E-ab* &amp;lt; 3).This study determined that the inadequacy and ambiguity of MSCs can be overcome by using MSCs in combination with flatbed scanners. MSCs can be used to calibrate flatbed scanners for the purpose of soil color measurement. A procedure is proposed. The procedure calibrates the scanner using 
 7 chips from the stable group of the 2.5Y sheet. This proced!
 ure enables the measurement of soil color inexpensively and efficiently. The high efficiency of the method was confirmed by testing the accuracy of the soil color determinations for 20 soil samples, covering a wide color range. The calibration procedure quadruples the precision of color estimation compared to solely using MSCs and results in soil color measurements close to those achievable with spectrophotometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Global population growth drives the increase in demand for water and food. Consequently, there is a build-up of pressure for land use for agricultural production, creating the necessity of sacrificing areas previously occupied by the native land cover to create production areas. However, globally, the possibilities of agricultural frontier expansion are limited, and agricultural expansion activities conducted without adequate planning can accelerate the erosive processes that decrease the potential land production capability. In an attempt to attenuate environmental imbalances, payment for ecosystem services (PES) programmes have been created, highlighting the possibility of their being applied in the agricultural sector. This study developed a methodology for PES that follows the basic principles of the land use capability classification system proposed by the United States Department of Agriculture. However, the study aimed to make the classification process operational in 
 a way that notes the conditions in which a rural property maintains its production capability without jeopardizing its environmental role. In this way, it is possible to evaluate whether a rural property is suitable to receive PES. To detail the steps for applying the methodology, a case study was conducted on a rural property in the town of Itabira, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Assessments of land capability for particular functions such as food production need to allow for uncertainties both in the criteria used to specify the function and in information on relevant soil properties. In this paper, we evaluate the use of digital soil assessment (DSA) for dynamic assessment of soil capability allowing for both uncertainties and spatial variability in soil properties and flexibility in the values of assessment criteria. We do this for soil constraints to rice production in the state of Punjab, India, where soil salinity and alkalinity are potentially important constraints to cropping. In DSA, spatial predictions of soil properties and associated uncertainties made with digital soil mapping (DSM) are used to assess soil functions. We use a combination of DSM and Monte Carlo simulation methods to estimate the spatial variation in soil electrical conductivity (ECe) and pH to 20 cm depth in soils across Punjab. We then use the estimates and associated unc
 ertainties to assess the likelihood that soil salinity or alkalinity or both could constrain rice production. Results show that allowing for prediction uncertainties of soil attributes results in far smaller areas affected by salinity (1.2 vs. 2.0 Mha) and alkalinity (3.0 vs. 3.2 Mha). Results also show the importance of correctly setting threshold values for constraint criteria and the flexibility of the DSA approach for setting thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Earth system models (ESMs) rely on the calculation of canopy conductance
in land surface models (LSMs) to quantify the partitioning of land
surface energy, water, and CO2 fluxes. This is achieved by scaling
stomatal conductance, g(w), determined from physiological models
developed for leaves. Traditionally, models for g(w) have been
semi-empirical, combining physiological functions with empirically
determined calibration constants. More recently, optimization theory has
been applied to model g(w) in LSMs under the premise that it has a
stronger grounding in physiological theory and might ultimately lead to
improved predictive accuracy. However, this premise has not been
thoroughly tested. Using original field data from contrasting forest
systems, we compare a widely used empirical type and a more recently
developed optimization-type g(w) model, termed BB and MED, respectively.
Overall, we find no difference between the two models when used to
simulate g(w) from photosynthesis data, or leaf gas exchange from a
coupled photosynthesis-conductance model, or gross primary productivity
and evapotranspiration for a FLUXNET tower site with the CLM5 community
LSM. Field measurements reveal that the key fitted parameters for BB and
MED, g(1B) and g(1M,) exhibit strong species specificity in magnitude
and sensitivity to CO2, and CLM5 simulations reveal that failure to
include this sensitivity can result in significant overestimates of
evapotranspiration for high-CO2 scenarios. Further, we show that g(1B)
and g(1M) can be determined from mean c(i)/c(a) (ratio of leaf
intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration). Applying this relationship
with c(i)/c(a) values derived from a leaf delta C-13 database, we obtain
a global distribution of g(1B) and g(1M), and these values correlate
significantly with mean annual precipitation. This provides a new
methodology for global parameterization of the BB and MED models in
LSMs, tied directly to leaf physiology but unconstrained by spatial
boundaries separating designated biomes or plant functional types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to
understand water cycle and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the Earth
system. Satellite-driven ET models provide global estimates, but many of
the ET algorithms have been designed independently of soil moisture
observations. As water for ET is sourced from the soil, incorporating
soil moisture into global remote sensing algorithms of ET should, in
theory, improve performance, especially in water-limited regions. This
paper presents an update to the widely-used Priestley Taylor-Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET algorithm to incorporate spatially
explicit daily surface soil moisture control on soil evaporation and
canopy transpiration. The updated algorithm is evaluated using 14
AmeriFlux eddy covariance towers co-located with COsmic-ray Soil
Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) soil moisture observations. The new
PT-JPL(SM) model shows reduced errors and increased explanation of
variance, with the greatest improvements in water-limited regions. Soil
moisture incorporation into soil evaporation improves ET estimates by
reducing bias and RMSE by 29.9% and 22.7% respectively, while soil
moisture incorporation into transpiration improves ET estimates by
reducing bias by 30.2%, RMSE by 16.9%. We apply the algorithm globally
using soil moisture observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive
Mission (SMAP). These new global estimates of ET show reduced error at
finer spatial resolutions and provide a rich dataset to evaluate land
surface and climate models, vegetation response to changes in water
availability and environmental conditions, and anthropogenic
perturbations to the water cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Global food security is negatively affected by drought. Climate
projections show that drought frequency and intensity may increase in
different parts of the globe. These increases are particularly hazardous
for developing countries. Early season forecasts on drought occurrence
and severity could help to better mitigate the negative consequences of
drought. The objective of this study was to assess if interannual
variability in agricultural productivity in Chile can be accurately
predicted from freely-available, near real-time data sources. As the
response variable, we used the standard score of seasonal cumulative
NDVI (zcNDVI), based on 2000-2017 data from Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as a proxy for anomalies of seasonal primary
productivity. The predictions were performed with forecast lead times
from one- to six-month before the end of the growing season, which
varied between census units in Chile. Predictor variables included the
zcNDVI obtained by cumulating NDVI from season start up to prediction
time; standardised precipitation indices derived from satellite rainfall
estimates, for time-scales of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation and the Multivariate ENSO oscillation indices; the
length of the growing season, and latitude and longitude. For each of
the 758 census units considered, the time series of the response and the
predictor variables were averaged for agricultural areas resulting in a
17-season time series per unit for each variable. We used two prediction
approaches: (i) optimal linear regression (OLR) whereby for each census
unit the single predictor was selected that best explained the
interannual zcNDVI variability, and (ii) a multi-layer feedforward
neural network architecture, often called deep learning (DL), where all
predictors for all units were combined in a single spatio-temporal
model. Both approaches were evaluated with a leave-one-year-out
cross-validation procedure. Both methods showed good prediction
accuracies for small lead times and similar values for all lead times.
The mean R-cv(2) values for OLR were 0.95, 0.83, 0.68, 0.56, 0.46 and
0.37, against 0.96, 0.84, 0.65, 0.54, 0.46 and 0.38 for DL, for one,
two, three, four, five, and six months lead time, respectively. Given
the wide range of climates and vegetation types covered within the study
area, we expect that the presented models can contribute to an improved
early warning system for agricultural drought in different geographical
settings around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) was
established to investigate the form, function, and dynamics of the
critical zone developed on sedimentary rocks in the Appalachian
Mountains in central Pennsylvania. When first established, the SSHCZO
encompassed only the Shale Hills catchment, a 0.08-km(2) subcatchment
within Shaver’s Creek watershed. The SSHCZO has now grown to include 120
km(2) of the Shaver’s Creek watershed. With that growth, the science
team designed a strategy to measure a parsimonious set of data to
characterize the critical zone in such a large watershed. This
parsimonious design includes three targeted subcatchments (including the
original Shale Hills), observations along the main stem of Shaver’s
Creek, and broad topographic and geophysical observations. Here we
describe the goals, the implementation of measurements, and the major
findings of the SSHCZO by emphasizing measurements of the main stem of
Shaver’s Creek as well as the original Shale Hills subcatchment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Understanding the feedback mechanisms between soil water content (SWC)
and biomass production is important for sustainable resources
management. Here we present a new method enabling simultaneous
noninvasive measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics based on cosmic ray
neutron sensing (CRNS). Recently, it was suggested that the neutron
ratio (N-r) between thermal neutron (TN) and fast neutron (FN) intensity
contains information on other hydrogen pools like vegetation, canopy
interception, and snow. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
accuracy of simultaneous measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics during
agricultural drought conditions using CRNS probes. To this end, we
instrumented an arable field cropped with sugar beet with CRNS probes
and a wireless in situ SWC sensor network. Belowground and aboveground
biomass were sampled in monthly intervals. We found a linear
relationship between N-r and the aboveground biomass that allowed to
continuously quantify the dry aboveground biomass development throughout
the growing season with a root-mean-square error from 0.14 to 0.22
kg/m(2). This information was used together with measured belowground
biomass to correct for the effect of biomass on SWC determination with
CRNS probes, which increased the accuracy of the SWC estimates
considerably as indicated by the decrease of the root-mean-square error
from 0.046 to 0.013 cm(3)/cm(3). We anticipate that future research on
the N-r can further improve the accuracy of SWC and biomass estimates
and extend the application of CRNS to include canopy interception,
ponding water, and snow water equivalent estimation for both stationary
and roving CRNS systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and temperature are often
measured or simulated by climate models at coarser spatiotemporal scales
than those needed for operational purposes. This has motivated more than
half a century of research in developing disaggregation methods that
break down coarse-scale time series into finer scales, with two primary
objectives: (a) reproducing the statistical properties of the fine-scale
process and (b) preserving the original coarse-scale data. Existing
methods either preserve a limited number of statistical moments at the
fine scale, which is often insufficient and can lead to an
unrepresentative approximation of the actual marginal distribution, or
are based on a limited number of a priori distributional assumptions,
for example, lognormal. Additionally, they are not able to account for
potential nonstationarity in the underlying fine-scale process. Here we
introduce a novel disaggregation method, named Disaggregation Preserving
Marginals and Correlations (DiPMaC), that is able to disaggregate a
coarse-scale time series to any finer scale, while reproducing the
probability distribution and the linear correlation structure of the
fine-scale process. DiPMaC is also generalized for arbitrary
nonstationary scenarios to reproduce time varying marginals.
Additionally, we introduce a computationally efficient algorithm, based
on Bernoulli trials, to optimize the disaggregation procedure and
guarantee preservation of the coarse-scale values. We focus on temporal
disaggregation and demonstrate the method by disaggregating monthly
precipitation to hourly, and time series with trends (e.g., climate
model projections), while we show its potential to disaggregate based on
general nonstationary scenarios. The example applications demonstrate
the performance and robustness of DiPMaC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In the grain growing region of Queensland and New South Wales,
Australia, crop production occurs predominantly under semiarid, rainfed
conditions. Vertosols dominate the soils used and many are prone to
structural problems. In this region, providing that crop nutrition is
adequate, optimising yield is largely dependent on maximising the
infiltration, storage and plant use of soil water. Soil constraints such
as sodicity, salinity, acidity, subsoil compaction and surface sealing
can limit these processes, leading to high yield losses. This review
examines management options to treat these constraints, focusing on
management where multiple constraints exist, and where these occur in
the subsoil. The main strategies reviewed include (a) use of gypsum to
treat sodicity and lime to treat acidity, which can lead to yield
increases of &amp;gt;100% in some circumstances, (b) cultivation or deep
ripping to break up compacted sodic layers and surface seals, (c)
incorporating soil organic matter to improve conditions for plant growth
and (d) selecting species, cultivars and management practices most
appropriate for constrained sites. Future research must be directed to
improving the profitability of ameliorant use for sodicity by increasing
our understanding of how to identify soils responsive to ameliorants,
and which combination of ameliorants will be cost effective when
sodicity occurs in combination with other constraints. In addition,
research needs to target ways to economically apply ameliorants in
subsoil environments, and better identify which crop species or
cultivars are productive on constrained sites, particularly those with
multiple constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Estimating the likely variance in soil organic carbon (OC) at the scale
of farm fields or smaller monitoring areas is necessary for developing
sampling protocols that allow temporal change to be detected. Given the
relatively low anticipated soil OC sequestration rates (&amp;lt;0.5 Mg/ha.0.30
m/year) for dryland agriculture it is important that sampling strategies
are designed to reduce any cumulative errors associated with measuring
soil OC. The first purpose of this study was to evaluate the spatial
variation in soil OC and nitrogen (N), in soil layers to 1.50 m depth at
two monitoring sites (Wagga Wagga and Yerong Creek, 0.5 ha each) in
southern New South Wales, Australia, where crop and pasture rotations
are practiced. Four variogram models were tested (linear, spherical,
Gaussian and exponential); however, no single model dominated across
sites or depths for OC or N. At both sites, the range was smallest in
surface soil, and on a scale suggesting that sowing rows (stubble) may
dominate the pattern of spatial dependence, whereas the longer ranges
appeared to be associated with horizon boundaries. The second purpose of
the study was to obtain an estimate of the population mean with 1%, 5%
and 10% levels of precision using the calculated variance. The number of
soil cores required for a 1% precision in estimation of the mean soil OC
or N was impractical at most depths (&amp;gt;500 per ha). About 30 soil cores
per composite sample to 1.50 m depth, each core being at least 10 m
apart, would ensure at least an average of 10% precision in the
estimation of the mean soil OC at these two sites, which represent the
agriculture of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The AgrHyS is a long-term agro-hydrological observatory dedicated to studying the processes controlling hydro-chemical fluxes in headwater catchments in response to the effects of agricultural. AgrHyS is composed of instrumented catchments located in western France in a temperate oceanic climate that are characterized by shallow groundwater (&amp;lt;8 m deep) over crystalline bedrocks (granite or schist) and is dominated by intensive agriculture with farming. AgrHyS provides long-term observations starting in 1990 and supports highly interdisciplinary studies that provide novel contributions to environmental sciences, including hydrology, geochemistry, agricultural and soil sciences, hydrogeology, bioclimatology, and ecology. Here we describe the observatory sites, observation strategy, data management policy, and data access. The objective is to show how AgrHyS has contributed to research in hydrological and environmental sciences through a review of major insights of the research.
  This analysis highlights the role of AgrHyS in linking, validating, and enriching successive and complementary projects conducted over the last 25 yr. The second objective is to invite new collaborations with a large scientific community for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The French critical zone initiative, called OZCAR (Observatoires de la Zone Critique-Application et Recherche or Critical Zone Observatories-Application and Research) is a National Research Infrastructure (RI). OZCAR-RI is a network of instrumented sites, bringing together 21 pre-existing research observatories monitoring different compartments of the zone situated between “the rock and the sky,” the Earth’s skin or critical zone (CZ), over the long term. These observatories are regionally based and have specific initial scientific questions, monitoring strategies, databases, and modeling activities. The diversity of OZCAR-RI observatories and sites is well representative of the heterogeneity of the CZ and of the scientific communities studying it. Despite this diversity, all OZCAR-RI sites share a main overarching mandate, which is to monitor, understand, and predict (“earthcast”) the fluxes of water and matter of the Earth’s near surface and how they will change in response
  to the “new climatic regime.” The vision for OZCAR strategic development aims at designing an open infrastructure, building a national CZ community able to share a systemic representation of the CZ, and educating a new generation of scientists more apt to tackle the wicked problem of the Anthropocene. OZCAR articulates around: (i) a set of common scientific questions and cross-cutting scientific activities using the wealth of OZCAR-RI observatories, (ii) an ambitious instrumental development program, and (iii) a better interaction between data and models to integrate the different time and spatial scales. Internationally, OZCAR-RI aims at strengthening the CZ community by providing a model of organization for pre-existing observatories and by offering CZ instrumented sites. OZCAR is one of two French mirrors of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructure (eLTER-ESFRI) project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Due to its ability to penetrate the cloud, Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SAR) has been a great resource for crop mapping. Previous research has
verified the applicability of SAR imagery in object-oriented crop
classification, however, speckle noise limits the generation of optimal
segmentation. This paper proposed an innovative SARbased maize mapping
method supported by optical image, Gaofen-1 PMS, based segmentation,
named as parcel based SAR classification assisted by optical
imagery-based segmentation (os-PSC). Polarimetric decomposition was
applied to extract polarimetric parameters from multi-temporal
RADARSAT-2 data. One Gaofen-1 image was then used for parcel extraction,
which was the basic unit for SAR image analysis. The final step was a
multistep classification for final maize mapping including: the
potential maize mask extraction, pure/mixed maize parcel division and an
integrated maize map production. Results showed that the overall
accuracy of the os-PSC method was 89.1%, higher than those of
pixel-level classification and SAR-based segmentation methods. The
comparison between optical- and SAR-based segmentation demonstrated that
optical-based segmentation would be better at representing maize field
boundaries than the SAR-based segmentation. Moreover, the parcel- and
pixel-level integrated classification will be suitable for many
agricultural systems with small landownership where inter-cropping is
common. Through integrating advantages of the SAR and optical data,
os-PSC shows promising potentials for crop mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Spatial and temporal information on plant and soil conditions is needed
urgently for monitoring of crop productivity. Remote sensing has been
considered as an effective means for crop growth monitoring due to its
timely updating and complete coverage. In this paper, we explored the
potential of L-band fully-polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle
Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data for crop monitoring and
classification. The study site was located in the Sacramento Valley, in
California where the cropping system is relatively diverse. Full season
polarimetric signatures, as well as scattering mechanisms, for several
crops, including almond, walnut, alfalfa, winter wheat, corn, sunflower,
and tomato, were analyzed with linear polarizations (HH, HV, and VV) and
polarimetric decomposition (Cloude-Pottier and Freeman-Durden)
parameters, respectively. The separability amongst crop types was
assessed across a full calendar year based on both linear polarizations
and decomposition parameters. The unique structure-related polarimetric
signature of each crop was provided by multitemporal UAVSAR data with a
fine temporal resolution. Permanent tree crops (almond and walnut) and
alfalfa demonstrated stable radar backscattering values across the
growing season, whereas winter wheat and summer crops (corn, sunflower,
and tomato) presented drastically different patterns, with rapid
increase from the emergence stage to the peak biomass stage, followed by
a significant decrease during the senescence stage. In general, the
polarimetric signature was heterogeneous during June and October, while
homogeneous during March-to-May and July-to-August. The scattering
mechanisms depend heavily upon crop type and phenological stage. The
primary scattering mechanism for tree crops was volume scattering (&amp;gt;
40%), while surface scattering (&amp;gt; 40%) dominated for alfalfa and winter
wheat, although double-bounce scattering (&amp;gt; 30%) was notable for alfalfa
during March-to-September. Surface scattering was also dominant (&amp;gt; 40%)
for summer crops across the growing season except for sunflower and
tomato during June and corn during July-to-October when volume
scattering (&amp;gt; 40%) was the primary scattering mechanism. Crops were
better discriminated with decomposition parameters than with linear
polarizations, and the greatest separability occurred during the peak
biomass stage (July-August). All crop types were completely separable
from the others when simultaneously using UAVSAR data spanning the whole
growing season. The results demonstrate the feasibility of L-band SAR
for crop monitoring and classification, without the need for optical
data, and should serve as a guideline for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil sampling is an important tool to gather information for making
proper decisions regarding the fertilization of fields. Depending on the
national regulations, the minimum frequency may be once per five years
and spatially every ten hectares. For precision farming purposes, this
is not sufficient. In precision farming, the challenge is to collect the
samples from such regions that are internally consistent while limiting
the number of samples required. For this purpose, management zones are
used to divide the field into smaller regions. This article presents a
novel approach to automatically determine the locations for soil samples
based on a soil map created from drone imaging after ploughing, and a
wearable augmented reality technology to guide the user to the generated
sample points. Finally, the article presents the results of a
demonstration carried out in southern Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Transport infrastructure is essential to moving over 85 million tonnes
of agricultural products and 30 million cubic metres of timber from
farms and production areas to domestic and international markets each
year in Australia. Agriculture supply chains in Australia are
characterised by long distances with transport costs accounting for up
to 40 percent of the market price. Targeted infrastructure investment
and/or regulatory changes can substantially reduce transport-related
logistics costs. To provide a comprehensive view of transport logistics
costs and benefits due to infrastructure investments and regulatory
changes in agriculture and forestry supply chains, CSIRO developed a
computer-based tool - the Transport Network Strategic Investment Tool
(TraNSIT). TraNSIT optimises transport routes for upto hundreds of
thousands of enterprises and millions of vehicle trips between farms and
their markets, providing information on routing to maximise cost
efficiencies. Through an Australian Government initiative, TraNSIT was
applied to over 30 commodities representing 98% of Australian
agricultural and plantation forestry volume transported by road and
rail. TraNSIT is now a comprehensive logistics tool that has been
applied to the largest agricultural supply chain dataset ever assembled
in Australia. This paper provides an overview of TraNSIT, its adaptation
to agriculture and forestry logistics as part of the project, and its
application to several case studies in Australia including new road
links, rail versus road and flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil profile data that characterize the physical and chemical properties
of a soil are among the required set of inputs for ecological, crop and
other dynamic simulation models. A web-based soil information system
often provides the site-specific soil data of which formats are not
readily compatible to crop models. The Soil daTA Retrieval Tool (START)
was developed to automate a series of procedures for preparation of soil
input data that includes the retrieval of soil profile data from the
information system, reorganization of data, estimation of soil
parameters, and creation of input files foi simulation models. In a case
study, the START was implemented to support the SoilGrids database
operated by the International Soil Reference and Information Center. It
took about 0.33% of time for the START to create soil input files
compared with manual preparation. These results suggest that the START
could provide an efficient approach for preparation of soil input files
especially for sites where little soil information is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil and plant monitoring systems are important tools for applying
precision agriculture techniques. To acquire soil-plant system data, the
user establishes a sampling strategy, goes to the field, collects data
and finally goes to the office for data analysis. Sometimes, when the
analysis is performed, the user realizes that the sampling strategy was
not adequate and needs to return to the field in order to collect more
data. To avoid problems with the sampling strategy, the solution is to
have a system that performs the data analysis immediately after its
collection, while the user is still in the field. To do that, we can use
single board computers; these types of platforms have ports to
communicate to sensors and good processing capabilities. Therefore, the
objective of this work was to develop an embedded system to perform
spatial variability data analysis in the field, right after data
acquisition. The software was developed using Python 3.6; the PyQt
Integrated Development Environment (Riverbank Computer Limited,
Dorchester, United Kingdom) was used to design a graphical user
interface. The BeagleBone Black board, running Debian version 8.6, was
used to implement the software. The analysis was divided into three
steps: in the first one, an outlier and inlier analysis was performed to
remove unwanted data; in the second one, the semivariogram was
generated, and the variable and standard deviation map was produced by
performing ordinary kriging; and in the last one, a cluster analysis was
performed to create management classes using a fuzzy k-means algorithm.
The graphical user interface showed the variable map and the variable
classes map. To test the developed software, soybean yield data that was
collected in a 31.6-ha field were used. The developed software was shown
to be efficient at performing the spatial variability of soybean yields.
The comparison of the generated maps shows the importance of filtering
the data before performing the analysis. The developed software is
available at the GitHub website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
To account for the diversity of agricultural and ecosystem situations in
hilly Mediterranean areas, the agro-hydrological observatory OMERE
(Observatoire Mediterraneen de l’Environnement Rural et de l’Eau)
monitors two farmed catchments-one in northern Tunisia and the other in
southern France. Mediterranean regions are typified by a highly variable
climate, with an alternation of long droughts and intense storms, and by
a strong heterogeneity of soil properties, due to a combination of
climate, relief, parent materials, sparse vegetation, intense land use,
man-made infrastructure (ditches, terraces, etc.), and agricultural
activities. In this context, OMERE aims to document the impacts of
agricultural and land management on mass fluxes in Mediterranean farmed
headwater catchments. The observation strategy is motivated by
monitoring water, sediment, and contaminant fluxes and hydrologic and
climatic variables at different spatial scales from cultivated plots and
landscape elements to the catchment scale. These measurements have been
performed at a fine time resolution over a long-term scale and by
surveying land use, agricultural practices, and soil surface
characteristics. The long-term observation strategy intends to support
integrative multidisciplinary research for elucidating the conditions
that improve soil and water management and delivery of ecosystem
services in a Mediterranean rainfed cultivated context. The observatory
has led to scientific insights regarding three scientific objectives:
(i) to better understand the fluxes of water, erosion, and contaminants,
especially pesticides, and of their natural and anthropogenic drivers on
short- and long-term scales; (ii) to analyze the aggregate effects of
farming and land management on mass fluxes across scales, from plot to
catchment or landscape scales; and (iii) to derive new scenarios for
sustainable agricultural management and improved delivery of ecosystem
services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
PurposeThe impacts of land-use change on dynamics of soil organic carbon
(SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in the subsoil
(&amp;gt;30cm) are poorly understood. This study aims to investigate whether
the effects of land-use change on stocks and stoichiometric ratios
(R-CN, R-CP, and R-NP) of SOC, TN, and TP can be different between
topsoil (0-30cm) and subsoil (30-60cm) in the Ili River Valley,
northwest China.Materials and methodsSoil samples (0-10, 10-20, 20-30,
30-40, 40-50, and 50-60cm) were collected from a pasture (PT), a
27-year-old cropland (CL) converted from PT, and a 13-year-old poplar
(Populus tomentosa Carr.) plantation (PP) converted from CL. SOC, TN,
and TP concentrations and soil bulk density were determined to calculate
stocks and stoichiometric ratios (molar ratios) of SOC, TN, and
TP.Results and discussionConversion from PT to CL led to substantial
losses in SOC, TN, and TP pools in both topsoil and subsoil, and the
reduction rates in subsoil (13.8-24.7%) were higher than those in
topsoil (8.5-17.3%), indicating that C, N, and P pools in subsoil could
also be depleted by cultivation. Similar to topsoil, significant
increases in SOC, TN, and TP stocks were detected after afforestation on
CL in subsoil, although the increase rates (31.2-56.2%) were lower than
those in topsoil (47.8-69.1%). Soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC),
which generally increased after conversion from PT to CL while decreased
after CL afforestation, showed significant negative correlations with
SOC, TN, and TP, suggesting that cultivation might lead to soil
degradation, whereas afforestation contributed to soil restoration in
this area. Significant changes in C:N:Pratios in topsoil were only
detected for R-NP after conversion from CL to PP. By contrast, land-use
change significantly altered both R-CN and R-NP in the subsoil,
demonstrating that the impacts of land-use change on R-CN and R-NP were
different between topsoil and subsoil. The significant relationship
between soil EC and R-NP suggested that R-NP might be a useful indicator
of soil salinization.ConclusionsStocks of SOC, TN, and TP as well as
R-CN and R-NP in subsoil showed different responses to land-use change
compared to those in topsoil in this typical agro-pastoral region.
Therefore, it is suggested that the effects of land-use change on
dynamics of SOC, TN, and TP in subsoil should also be evaluated to
better understand the role of land-use change in global biogeochemical
cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Data assimilation is the application of Bayes’ theorem to condition the
states of a dynamical systems model on observations. Any real-world
application of Bayes’ theorem is approximate, and therefore, we cannot
expect that data assimilation will preserve all of the information
available from models and observations. We outline a framework for
measuring information in models, observations, and evaluation data in a
way that allows us to quantify information loss during (necessarily
imperfect) data assimilation. This facilitates quantitative analysis of
trade-offs between improving (usually expensive) remote sensing
observing systems versus improving data assimilation design and
implementation. We demonstrate this methodology on a previously
published application of the ensemble Kalman filter used to assimilate
remote sensing soil moisture retrievals from Advanced Microwave
Scattering Radiometer for Earth (AMSR-E) into the Noah land surface
model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Measurements of root-zone soil moisture across spatial scales of tens to
thousands of meters have been a challenge for many decades. The mobile
application of Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS) is a promising approach
to measure field soil moisture noninvasively by surveying large regions
with a ground-based vehicle. Recently, concerns have been raised about a
potentially biasing influence of local structures and roads. We employed
neutron transport simulations and dedicated experiments to quantify the
influence of different road types on the CRNS measurement. We found that
roads introduce a substantial bias in the CRNS estimation of field soil
moisture compared to off-road scenarios. However, this effect becomes
insignificant at distances beyond a few meters from the road. Neutron
measurements on the road could overestimate the field value by up to 40
% depending on road material, width, and the surrounding field water
content. The bias could be largely removed with an analytical correction
function that accounts for these parameters. Additionally, an empirical
approach is proposed that can be used without prior knowledge of field
soil moisture. Tests at different study sites demonstrated good
agreement between road-effect corrected measurements and field soil
moisture observations. However, if knowledge about the road
characteristics is missing, measurements on the road could substantially
reduce the accuracy of this method. Our results constitute a practical
advancement of the mobile CRNS methodology, which is important for
providing unbiased estimates of field-scale soil moisture to support
applications in hydrology, remote sensing, and agriculture.Plain

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
With satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals becoming widely and
continuously available, we aim to develop a method to objectively
integrate the drought indices into one that is more accurate and
consistently reliable. The data sets used in this paper include the Noah
land surface model-based SM estimations,
Atmosphere-Land-Exchange-Inverse model-based Evaporative Stress Index,
and the satellite SM products from the Advanced Scatterometer, WindSat,
Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and Soil Moisture Operational Product
System. Using the Triple Collocation Error Model (TCEM) to quantify the
uncertainties of these data, we developed an optically blended drought
index (BDI_b) that objectively integrates drought estimations with the
lowest TCEM-derived root-mean-square-errors in this paper. With respect
to the reported drought records and the drought monitoring benchmarks
including the U.S. Drought Monitor, the Palmer Drought Severity Index
and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index products,
the BDI_b was compared with the sample average blending drought index
(BDI_s) and the RMSE-weighted average blending drought indices (BDI_w).
Relative to the BDI_s and the BDI_w, the BDI_b performs more
consistently with the drought monitoring benchmarks. With respect to the
official drought records, the developed BDI_b shows the best performance
on tracking drought development in terms of time evolution and spatial
patterns of 2010-Russia, 2011-USA, 2013-New Zealand droughts and other
reported agricultural drought occurrences over the 2009-2014 period.
These results suggest that model simulations and remotely sensed
observations of SM can be objectively translated into useful information
for drought monitoring and early warning, in turn can reduce drought
risk and impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Considering film flow in the development of a soil hydraulic model has
become a key method for improving model performance under dry
conditions. With the considerable improvement in model performance, the
trade-off is often to increase the model complexity, thus limiting a
model’s application. In this paper, an alternative model is presented to
predict soil hydraulic conductivities over the entire moisture range. In
contrast to existing models that treat conductivity as a summation of
the capillary and film components, the proposed model applies a single
equation to capture the variation of the two conductivity components.
The new model, therefore, presents a simple form, with no extra
parameters added to the basic capillary models. Model testing with 24
soil data sets revealed that it was successful in predicting
conductivities over the complete moisture range. A comparison with
existing models demonstrated that the proposed model was generally in
higher agreement with observations, achieving a much lower mean value of
the root mean square errors for the predicted conductivities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Modeling of the variogram is a critical step for most geostatistical
methods. However, most of the prevalent variogram-based solutions are
designed without sufficient consideration of the effect of the
interpolation process on their application. This paper proposes an
automated variogram modeling framework, which simultaneously considers
the fit of the experimental variogram and interpolation accuracy in the
modeling variogram interpolation result. The variogram modeling
framework can be treated as a nonlinear optimization problem with two
sub-goals. The first is to optimize the goodness of fit between the
experimental and theoretical variogram values under the conditions of
their designated parameters. Second, we seek to optimize the difference
between measured values and the associated kriging estimates with the
candidate variogram model. A typical case study was chosen using a
public dataset to test the proposed method, which was implemented using
a genetic algorithm, and its performance was compared with the ones of
other commonly applied variogram modeling approaches. As expected, the
traditional variogram modeling method that only considers fitting
standard experimental variograms showed severe sensitivity to errors in
data and parameters; classical cross-validation modeling results tended
to overlook the experimental variograms. By contrast, the proposed
method succeeded in producing variogram models with robust, high-quality
kriging estimates and favorable fitness of experimental variograms in a
more powerful and flexible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Surface soil moisture content (SMC) is known to impact soil reflectance
at all wavelengths of the solar spectrum. As a consequence, many
semi-empirical methods aim at inferring SMC from soil reflectance, but
very few rely on physically-based models. This article presents a
multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance called MARMIT
(multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance) as a function
of SMC given on a mass basis and a method called MARMITforSMC to
estimate it from soil reflectance spectra. This model depicts a wet soil
as a dry soil covered with a thin film of water. It is used to assess
SMC over seven independent laboratory datasets gathered from the
literature. A learning phase is required to link the thickness of the
water film with the SMC. For that purpose, a sigmoid function, the
parameters of which are related to soil physical and chemical properties
such as porosity, grain size and mineralogy composition, is fitted. SMC
can be inferred with good accuracy (RMSE approximate to 3%) if the
learning step is applied soil by soil. The link between SMC and water
thickness actually depends on soil texture and chemical composition. If
the soils are divided into classes and if the learning phase is applied
to a class, the RMSE slightly increases up to 5%. Finally, MARMITforSMC
provides lower RMSE than any other existing semi-empirical or
physically-based method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
High-quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series
data are important for many regional and global ecological and
environmental applications. Unfortunately, residual noise in current
NDVI time-series products greatly hinders their further applications.
Several noise-reduction methods have been proposed during the past two
decades, but two important issues remain to be resolved. First, the
methods usually perform poorly for cases of continuous missing data in
the NDVI time series. Second, they generally assume negatively biased
noise in the NDVI time series and thus erroneously raise some local low
NDVI values in certain cases (e.g., the harvest period for multi-season
crops).We therefore developed a new noise-reduction algorithm called the
Spatial-Temporal Savitzky-Golay (STSG) method. The new method assumes
discontinuous clouds in space and employs neighboring pixels to assist
in the noise reduction of the target pixel in a particular year. The
relationship between the NDVI of neighboring pixels and that of the
target pixel was obtained from multi-year NDVI time series thanks to the
accumulation of NDVI data over many years, which would have been
impossible a decade ago. We tested STSG on 16-day composite MODIS NDVI
time-series data from 2001 to 2016 in regions of mainland China and 11
phenology camera sites in North American. The results showed that STSG
performed significantly better compared with four previous widely used
methods (i.e., the Asymmetric Gaussian, Double Logistic, Fourier-based,
and Savitzky-Golay filter methods). One obvious advantage was that STSG
was able to address the problem of temporally continuous NDVI gaps. STSG
effectively increased local low NDVI values and simultaneously avoided
overcorrecting low NDVI values during the crop harvest period. In
addition, implementing STSG required only raw MODIS NDVI time-series
products without any additional burden of data requirements. All of
these advantages make STSG a promising noise-reduction method for
generating high quality NDVI time-series data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS) is an airborne
high resolution imaging spectrometer built at NASA’s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) for evaluating solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from
the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). OCO-2 is a NASA mission
designed to measure atmospheric CO2 but one of the novel data products
is SIF, retrieved using reductions in the optical depth of Fraunhofer
lines in OCO-2’s O-2 Aband, covering 757-775 nm at 0.042 nm spectral
resolution. CFIS was specifically designed to retrieve SIF within the
wavelength range of OCO-2, but extends further down to 737 nm, nearly
maintaining the high spectral resolution of the OCO-2 instrument (0.07
vs. 0.042 nm). Here, we provide an overview of the instrument
calibration and performance as well as the retrieval strategy based on
non-linear weighted least-squares. To illustrate the retrieval
performance using actual flight data, we focus on data acquired over
agricultural fields in Mead, Nebraska from an unpressurized Twin Otter
(DHC-6) aircraft at a flight altitude of 3000 m above ground level
(AGL). Spectral residuals are consistent with expected detector noise,
which enables us to compute realistic 1-alpha precision errors of
0.5-0.7 W/m(2)/sr/mu m for typical SIF retrievals, which can be reduced
to &amp;lt; 0.2 W/m(2)/sr/mu m when individual data is gridded at 30 m spatial
resolution. The 30 m resolution also enabled direct comparison with the
Crop Data Layer from the National Agricultural Statistics Service as
well as Landsat imagery (NDVI, EVI, T-sk(in)), taken just a day prior to
the CFIS overflights. Results show consistently higher vegetation
indices and SIF values over soy fields compared to corn, likely due to
the respective phenological stage, which might already have affected
chlorophyll content and canopy structure (August 15, 2016). While this
work is intended to highlight the technical capabilities and performance
of CFIS, the comparisons against Landsat and crop types provide insights
into how CFIS can be used to study mechanisms related to photosynthesis
at fine spatial scales, with the fidelity needed to obtain un-biased SIF
retrievals void of atmospheric correction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The use of Munsell colour charts is the classical way of determining
colour information in soil science. The procedure is well-known and
consists of visually comparing soil samples with colour chips contained
in the charts. This visual approach has several drawbacks and although
the chart-based procedure is routinely used, it is not easy to find
systematic studies on the accuracy of this methodology. In this paper,
we seek to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of using soil
colour charts as a colour measurement device. The tool used to conduct
our study is a modification to the attribute agreement analysis (AAA)
method which consists of finding matches between colour standards and
colour designations obtained by several appraisers. In the experiment,
standards were obtained using a trichromatic colorimeter coupled to a
computer program that implements the k nearest neighbour (k-NN)
classification algorithm. In order to do the experiment, 276 soil
samples were observed twice by four trained appraisers (2208 data
records). The naive count of matches across all the records in the
dataset gave &amp;lt; 5% of agreement for all three colour components Hue,
Value and Chroma. The modified AAA criterion implemented in the study
gave a clear increase in all indicators with values ranging from 82.2%
to 100% in the agreement within appraisers, 39.5% in the agreement
between appraisers, and 42.8% in the agreement of appraisers vs.
standards. Results also show that users of the Munsell charts tend to
mostly report correct Hues but higher Values and Chromas than true soil
colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We have mapped the broad groups of crops grown each summer and winter,
from 1987 to 2017, for a 300,000km 2 region of Queensland, Australia.
These maps are part of a legislated decision-making process for the
protection of prime agricultural land. For summer, the two groups of
crops are ‘Coarse-grain &amp;amp; Pulse’ and ‘Cotton’. For winter, the two
groups of crops are ‘Cereal’ and ‘Pulse’. Non-crop groups, present in
both summer and winter, are ‘Bare soil’ and ‘Other’ (comprising
pastures, woody vegetation, and crop residues). The foundation of the
maps is time-series modelling-specifically, applying the concepts of
geostatistics in the temporal domain-to model the variation in
land-surface phonology within a growing season. The time-series model is
flexible, robust, parsimonious, parallelisable, and able to deal with
irregular observations. We combined satellite imagery from the Landsat
sensors, as well as, when available, Sentinel-2A and MODIS (with the
last two reprojected to the 30m grid of Landsat). We applied the
time-series model pixel-wise across the study region, to three variables
derived from satellite imagery gathered for an individual growing
season: enhanced vegetation index, and the sub-pixel proportions of
bare-ground and non-photosynthetic vegetation. Weekly-averaged predicted
phenological metrics then served as explanatory variables in a tiered,
tree-based classification model, for the prediction of the groups. The
classification model comprised two expert rules and two random forests.
Prior to fitting the classification model, geospatial object-based image
analysis was used to change the scale of analysis from individual pixels
to (approximately) field-based segments. From the perspective of a
map-user, in any given growing season we predicted ‘Coarse-grain &amp;amp;
Pulse’ correctly in 79% of cases; the values for ‘Cotton’, ‘Cereal’, and
‘Pulse’ were 90%, 84%, and 73%, respectively; ‘Bare soil’ was 72% in
summer, and 88% in winter. ‘Other’ was the most accurately mapped group
(98% correct in summer, and 99% correct in winter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil available water capacity is an important soil property for land use
planning, drought risk assessment, and modelling crop production or
carbon cycling. Measurements of soil moisture at several soil water
potentials are expensive and time-consuming, hence it is common to
estimate available water capacity with pedotransfer functions (PTFs).
Available PTFs for France rarely provide uncertainty estimates for the
model coefficients and predictions, which are often required for error
propagation analysis and modelling ecological processes. The objectives
of this study were: 1) to develop class-PTFs and 2) continuous-PTFs with
associated uncertainties, and 3) to assess the domain of applicability
of the PTFs across metropolitan France. We used the SOLHYDRO database
for calibrating continuous and class PTFs. For continuous PTFs we used
linear regression models using sand, clay, organic carbon (SOC), and
bulk density (BD) as predictor variables, whereas class-PTFs were
defined by texture class, bulk density, and horizon type (all horizons,
topsoils, subsoils). The models were validated with an independent
validation dataset. The domain of applicability of the PTFs was
evaluated calculating the Mahalanobis distance between the calibration
dataset and horizon data from the French soil monitoring network (RMQS).
At independent validation, texture class-PTFs had a RMSE between 0.047
cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.058 cm(3) cm(-3) and continuous-PTFs had a RMSE
between 0.040 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.053 cm(3) cm(-3). Texture class-PTFs
had similar or better predictive performance than texture-structural
class-PTFs. The prediction performance of continuous-PTFs improved
slightly when including SOC and BD in the models. The variance of the
predictions of continuous-PTFs associated to error in the model
coefficients was rather small, and increased as the values of the
predictor variables were more distant to the centroid of the calibration
data. We provide the PTF users with tools for classifying new samples as
within or outside the applicability domain of the PTFs. When applied to
the RMQS dataset, &amp;gt; 50% of the horizons outside the domain of
applicability were located in forests and natural areas or managed
pastures. The spatial distribution of RMQS horizons outside the domain
of applicability of the PTF can inform future sampling locations for
increasing the diversity of the soil properties and site conditions
represented by the SOLHYDRO dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The capacity of soils to store organic carbon represents a key function
of soils that is not only decisive for climate regulation but also
affects other soil functions. Recent efforts to assess the impact of
land management on soil functionality proposed that an indicator- or
proxy-based approach is a promising alternative to quantify soil
functions compared to time- and cost-intensive measurements,
particularly when larger regions are targeted. The objective of this
review is to identify measurable biotic or abiotic properties that
control soil organic carbon (SOC) storage at different spatial scales
and could serve as indicators for an efficient quantification of SOC.
These indicators should enable both an estimation of actual SOC storage
as well as a prediction of the SOC storage potential, which is an
important aspect in land use and management planning. There are many
environmental conditions that affect SOC storage at different spatial
scales. We provide a thorough overview of factors from micro-scales
(particles to pedons) to the global scale and discuss their suitability
as indicators for SOC storage: clay mineralogy, specific surface area,
metal oxides, Ca and Mg cations, microorganisms, soil fauna,
aggregation, texture, soil type, natural vegetation, land use and
management, topography, parent material and climate. As a result, we
propose a set of indicators that allow for time- and cost-efficient
estimates of actual and potential SOC storage from the local to the
regional and subcontinental scale. As a key element, the fine mineral
fraction was identified to determine SOC stabilization in most soils.
The quantification of SOC can be further refined by including climatic
proxies, particularly elevation, as well as information on land use,
soil management and vegetation characteristics. To enhance its
indicative power towards land management effects, further “functional
soil characteristics”, particularly soil structural properties and
changes in the soil microbial biomass pool should be included in this
indicator system. The proposed system offers the potential to
efficiently estimate the SOC storage capacity by means of simplified
measures, such as soil fractionation procedures or infrared
spectroscopic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Unstructured triangular meshes are an efficient and effective landscape
representation that are suitable for use in distributed hydrological and
land surface models. Their variable spatial resolution provides similar
spatial performance to high-resolution structured grids while using only
a fraction of the number of elements. Many existing triangulation
methods either sacrifice triangle quality to introduce variable
resolution or maintain well formed uniform meshes at the expense of
variable triangle resolution. They are also generally constructed to
only fulfil topographic constraints. However, distributed hydrological
and land surface models require triangles of varying resolution to
provide landscape representations that accurately represent the spatial
heterogeneity of driving meteorology, physical parameters and process
operation in the simulation domain. As such, mesh generators need to
constrain the unstructured mesh to not only topography but to other
important surface and sub-surface features. This work presents novel
multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software that allows mesh
generation to be constrained to an arbitrary number of important
features while maintaining a variable spatial resolution. Triangle
quality is supported as well as a smooth gradation from small to large
triangles. Including these additional constraints results in a better
representation of spatial heterogeneity than from classic
topography-only constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Coastal areas are vulnerable to the impacts of tropical cyclones (TC),
tsunamis and other water super-elevation events, but the frequency of
these events is often poorly represented by conventional records.
Coastal overwash deposits (including washover fans) can provide a
longer-term archive of event frequency. Because of their low-gradient
geomorphic form, washover fans require high accuracy
(centimetre-resolution) topographic models to understand patterns of
connectivity and dynamics that control archive formation. Using images
collected by a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS, or drone’) and
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry techniques, we apply a novel
point-cloud filtering technique based on KMeans classification of the
R-G-B colour of each X-Y-Z point to remove vegetation and create a
centimetre-resolution and accuracy bare-earth digital terrain model
(DTM) of a washover fan in Exmouth Gulf (Western Australia). Using the
RPAS-SfM orphophoto and DEM data, supported by ground-penetrating radar
(GPR) and field stratigraphic analysis, we show how this approach can be
applied to understand dynamics controlling low-gradient geomorphic
landforms, using an example of a washover fan sedimentary archive in
northwestern Australia created by extreme overwash events. Our approach
reveals the likely role of backflooding and terrestrial runoff in
creating backwater environment for sub-aqueous deposition and good
sediment preservation and identifies key areas to target for detailed
dating and stratigraphic analysis of a potentially decadal to
sub-millennial resolution sediment archive of TC activity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Efficient irrigation management requires a sound information basis;
therefore, various environmental measurements are currently used in
irrigation scheduling. Among other technics, the recent progress in
electromagnetic sensors technologies promoted the development of
automated irrigation scheduling systems based on soil water content
sensors with very promising results in terms of water savings. However,
a key factor for the adequate performance of such systems is proper
placement of soil moisture sensors. Up to now, sensor placement
guidelines are fragmentary or empirically determined from site and crop
specific experiments. This study aims to extend the findings of previous
studies investigating the issue of proper positioning of water content
sensors in drip irrigation scheduling systems in uniform soils for the
case of layered soils. In this context the representativeness of soil
water content sensors’ readings and the existence of Time Stable
Representative Positions (TSRP) are investigated using a specially
developed mathematical model. The use of soil water content probes that
are able to monitor soil water content at various depths is also
evaluated. It was found that in contrast to the previous findings
concerning uniform soils, in the case of layered soils it is not
possible to precisely monitor the average soil water content temporal
variation in the root zone using a single sensor; however, it is
feasible to achieve this using a pair of sensors. Furthermore, common
optimum positions for a pair of sensors providing representative soil
water content readings independently from the prevailing conditions and
the irrigation system configuration can be identified. It was also found
that soil water content probes covering the average rooting depth and
penetrating both soil layers are also able to provide representative
soil water content readings during the whole duration of the irrigation
cycle. The above results represent a further step towards the
development of general guidelines for sensor placement in soil water
content based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems.&lt;/p&gt;

(Comm-PSO-ANFIS) and committee multiple linear regression (Comm-MLR)
model applied to forecast monthly standardized precipitation index
(SPI). The proposed Comm-ELM model incorporates historical monthly
rainfall, temperature, humidity, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) at
monthly lag (t - 1) and the respective month (i.e., periodicity factor)
as the explanatory variable for the drought’s behaviour defined by SPI.
The model accuracy is assessed by root mean squared error, mean absolute
error, correlation coefficient, Willmott’s index, Nash-Sutcliffe
efficiency and Legates McCabe’s index in the independent test dataset.
With the incorporation of periodicity as an input factor, the
performance of the Comm-ELM model for Islamabad, Multan and Dera Ismail
Khan (D. I. Khan) as the test stations, was remarkably improved in
respect to the Comm-PSO-ANFIS and Comm-MLR model. Other than the
superiority of Comm-ELM over the alternative models tested for monthly
SPI forecasting, we also highlight the importance of the periodicity
cycle as a pertinent predictor variable in a drought forecasting model.
The results ascertain that the model accuracy scales with geographic
factors, due to the complexity of drought phenomenon and its
relationship with the different inputs and data attributes that can
affect the overall evolution of a drought event. The findings of this
study has important implications for agricultural decision-making where
future knowledge of drought can be used to develop climate risk
mitigation strategies for better crop management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The Earth is a complex system comprising many interacting spatial and
temporal scales. We developed a transdisciplinary data-model integration
(TDMI) approach to understand, predict; and manage for these complex
dynamics that focuses on spatiotemporal modeling and cross-scale
interactions. Our approach employs human-centered machine-learning
strategies supported by a data science integration system (DSIS).
Applied to ecological problems, our approach integrates knowledge and
data on (a) biological processes, (b) spatial heterogeneity in the land
surface template, and (c) variability in environmental drivers using
data and knowledge drawn from multiple lines of evidence (cc.,
observations, experimental manipulations, analytical and numerical
models, products from imagery, conceptual model reasoning, and theory).
We apply this transdisciplinary approach to a suite of increasingly
complex ecologically relevant problems and then discuss how information
management systems will need to evolve into DSIS to allow other
transdisciplinary questions to be addressed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Feedback mechanisms between abiotic and biotic processes in dryland
ecosystems lead to a strong sensitivity to interannual variations in
climate. Under a future regime of higher temperatures but potentially
increased rainfall variability drylands are anticipated to experience
changes in wind and water transport that will alter plant community
composition and feedback on landscape connectivity Here, we present a
conceptual framework for understanding the coupling of vegetation
productivity, aeolian transport, and hydrologic connectivity under
anticipated changes in future climate, which suggests that a more
extreme climatic regime will lead to more connected landscapes with
attendant losses in soil, nutrient, and water resources. When enhanced
connectivity triggers state changes, irreversible changes in ecosystem
functioning can occur, with implications for the future of global
drylands.&lt;/p&gt;

Soil organic carbon (SOC) changes slowly, and final management
influences can be measured only after decades. Analysis of archived
samples from a site established on grassland in 1911 showed that SOC,
under wheat systems, approached steady state after several decades, and
that its amount reflected the inputs of residue C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This study introduces a hybrid spatial modelling framework, which
accounts for spatial non-stationarity, spatial autocorrelation and
environmental correlation. A set of geographic spatially autocorrelated
Euclidean distance fields (EDF) was used to provide additional spatially
relevant predictors to the environmental covariates commonly used for
mapping. The approach was used in combination with machine-learning
methods, so we called the method Euclidean distance fields in
machine-learning (EDM). This method provides advantages over other
prediction methods that integrate spatial dependence and state factor
models, for example, regression kriging (RK) and geographically weighted
regression (GWR). We used seven generic (EDFs) and several commonly used
predictors with different regression algorithms in two digital soil
mapping (DSM) case studies and compared the results to those achieved
with ordinary kriging (OK), RK and GWR as well as the multiscale methods
ConMap, ConStat and contextual spatial modelling (CSM). The algorithms
tested in EDM were a linear model, bagged multivariate adaptive
regression splines (MARS), radial basis function support vector machines
(SVM), Cubist, random forest (RF) and a neural network (NN) ensemble.
The study demonstrated that DSM with EDM provided results comparable to
RK and to the contextual multiscale methods. Best results were obtained
with Cubist, RF and bagged MARS. Because the tree-based approaches
produce discontinuous response surfaces, the resulting maps can show
visible artefacts when only the EDFs are used as predictors (i.e. no
additional environmental covariates). Artefacts were not obvious for SVM
and NN and to a lesser extent bagged MARS. An advantage of EDM is that
it accounts for spatial non-stationarity and spatial autocorrelation
when using a small set of additional predictors. The EDM is a new method
that provides a practical alternative to more conventional spatial
modelling and thus it enhances the DSM toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The reduced use of phosphorus (P) fertilizer in fertile soil has
reverted the P balance to negative in some regions. It is unclear how
long current soil P stocks will ensure adequate P supply to crops. In
addition, it is unknown if current soil tests for available P describe
bioavailable P adequately in soil where P is becoming depleted. We set
up an accelerated soil P mining test to address these questions.
Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne, Melpetra tetra) was grown for 2years
in a greenhouse on 5-cm-deep soil layers of eight contrasting soils with
periodic grass clipping. Each soil was split into four fertilizer
treatments (i.e. no P (-P) and adequate P (+P)) and two nitrogen levels,
the latter to alter the rate of P uptake. The long-term P mining induced
P-related yield losses in seven of the 16 soil treatments. The
cumulative uptake of shoot P at which yield loss started to exceed 10%
(-P versus +P) varied over a small range of 37-74mg Pkg(-1) soil among
the soils. This critical cumulative P uptake (CCP) was related to the
soil P content prior to mining measured by five soil P tests (ammonium
oxalate, ammonium lactate (AL), Olsen P, 0.01m CaCl2 and the diffusive
gradient in thin film technique (DGT)); the largest R-2 values were
observed for P-AL (R-2=0.72) and P-DGT (R-2=0.73). However, none of the
tests was diagnostic for yield loss during the depletion period.
Increased N supply accelerated growth and rates of P uptake and
decreased the CCP by a factor of 1.7 on average, illustrating the effect
of the rate of biomass production. The CCP values obtained in the
treatment with reduced N fertilizer application are likely to be the
most relevant for the field and suggest that current stocks allow
adequate P supply for arable crops for 3-8years under zero P application
(0-23cm) in soils similar to those tested. The lack of a successful
diagnosis for P deficiency during this depletion experiment calls for
further calibration of soil tests for available P in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil bulk density ((b)) and volumetric water content () determine the
volume fractions of soil solids, water and air, and influence mass and
energy transfer in soil. It is desirable to monitor (b) and concurrently
and non-destructively. We present a heat pulse-based method for
simultaneous determination of (b) and from soil thermal properties. The
method uses equations that relate (b) and to soil volumetric heat
capacity (C) and to soil thermal conductivity (). We developed a
three-step procedure to calculate (b) and from C and measured by a heat
pulse sensor, with soil texture and specific heat of soil solids known a
priori. Laboratory evaluation of soil samples with various textures
showed that the three-step method provided reliable estimates of (b) and
at values greater than the critical water content ((c)) when started to
respond notably to increases in . This method provides a new way to
determine (b) and simultaneously with heat pulse sensors.HighlightsWe
developed an approach to determine soil bulk density (.. b) and water
content (..) simultaneously with a heat pulse sensor. We estimated.. b
and.. from soil thermal properties based on heat capacity and thermal
conductivity models. The new approach provided reliable.. b and.. values

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
A novel proximal sensing framework for high-resolution soil water
content profile retrieval under laboratory conditions has been
developed. Constant-head upward-flow experiments were conducted for a
number of soils that cover a wide textural range. The soils were packed
into quartz Hele-Shaw cells, and the profile was imaged at high temporal
frequency with a short-wave infrared (SWIR) camera in the 900- to
1700-nm electromagnetic domain during upward infiltration of water. The
SWIR reflectance recorded for each spatial pixel was converted to soil
water content with a recently developed linear physical model. Because
of the linearity of the model, its parameters were assumed to be
identical at both the pixel and column scales, and this allowed simple
self-calibration during the experiment. The obtained water content
profiles were in good agreement with soil water content data measured
independently with a recently developed time domain reflectometry array
with 1-cm depth resolution. In addition, the accuracy of the soil water
content profiles was verified based on the water mass balance. The
high-spatiotemporal-resolution SWIR reflectance-derived water content
profiles allow calculation of water flux densities, which provides a
potential new avenue for the rapid estimation of soil hydraulic
properties and processes via inverse numerical or analytical modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) into its constituent components,
evaporation (E) and transpiration (T), is important for numerous
hydrological purposes including assessing impacts of management
practices on water use efficiency and improved validation of vadose zone
models that parameterize E and T separately. However, most
long-established observational techniques have short observational
timescales and spatial footprints, raising questions about the
representativeness of these measurements. In the past 15 yr, new
approaches have allowed ET partitioning at spatial scales ranging from
the pedon to the globe and at long timescales. In this update, we review
some recent methodological developments for partitioning ET. These
include micrometeorological approaches involving the flux variance
partitioning of high-frequency eddy covariance observations and proxies
for photosynthesis and transpiration such as measurements of isotopic
fractionation and carbonyl sulfide uptake. We discuss advances in
partitioning the energy balance between canopy and soil using remote
sensing. We conclude that the flux variance partitioning with raw eddy
covariance data and the two-source energy balance approaches with remote
sensing platforms may have the greatest potential for partitioning ET,
in part because large public repositories of eddy covariance and
satellite data could be readily reprocessed to partition ET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
An approach for using lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator) regression in creating sparse 3D models of soil properties for
spatial prediction at multiple depths is presented. Modeling soil
properties in 3D benefits from interactions of spatial predictors with
soil depth and its polynomial expansion, which yields a large number of
model variables (and corresponding model parameters). Lasso is able to
perform variable selection, hence reducing the number of model
parameters and making the model more easily interpretable. This also
prevents overfitting, which makes the model more accurate. The presented
approach was tested using four variable selection approaches - none,
stepwise, lasso and hierarchical lasso, on four kinds of models -
standard linear model, linear model with polynomial expansion of depth,
linear model with interactions of covariates with depth and linear model
with interactions of covariates with depth and its polynomial expansion.
This framework was used to predict Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in three
contrasting study areas: Bor (Serbia), Edgeroi (Australia) and the
Netherlands. Results show that lasso yields substantial improvements in
accuracy over standard and stepwise regression - up to 50 % of total
variance. It yields models which contain up to five times less nonzero
parameters than the full models and that are usually more sparse than
models obtained by stepwise regression, up to three times. Extension of
the standard linear model by including interactions typically improves
the accuracy of models produced by lasso, but is detrimental to standard
and stepwise regression. Regarding computation time, it was demonstrated
that lasso is several orders of magnitude more efficient than stepwise
regression for models with tens or hundreds of variables (including
interactions). Proper model evaluation is emphasized. Considering the
fact that lasso requires meta-parameter tuning, standard
cross-validation does not suffice for adequate model evaluation, hence a
nested cross-validation was employed. The presented approach is
implemented as publicly available sparsereg3D R package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Object-based fuzzy clustering method has been widely used to
remote-sensing clustering analysis. Mean and interval spectral
signatures are typically used to describe an object’s features. However,
accurately distinguishing two objects with the same mean or interval
values and different internal distributions is difficult. Focus on this
problem, we developed triangular fuzzy set modeling to describe objects
and designed an interval distance metric to measure the dissimilarities
between triangular fuzzy sets. Furthermore, using the variation of
fuzzifier (two fuzzifiers) to construct interval type-2 fuzzy c-means
(IT2FCM) clustering methods, which are sensitive to the choice of
fuzzifier, has uncertainty and subjectivity. Thus, an enhanced IT2FCM
clustering algorithm that directly adopts the interval distance metric
rather than the variation of fuzzifier is proposed for high-resolution
remote-sensing clustering. We performed land-cover classification
experiments for three study areas by utilizing remote-sensing images
from the SPOT-5 and Gaofen-2 satellite sensor, which spatial resolution
are approximately 10 m and 1 m, respectively. Visual and numerical
results, including Kappa coefficients and the confusion matrix, were
utilized to verify the classification results. The experimental results
indicated that triangular fuzzy set modeling is appropriate for
extracting features from ground objects; moreover, it limits the
classification errors caused by same objects with different spectral
features. Compared with the object-based interval-valued fuzzy c-means
(IV-FCM) method reported in the literature, the proposed algorithm
results in improved classification quality and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Local singularity analysis (LSA) has been proven to be an effective tool
for identifying weak geochemical anomalies. The common practice of
grid-based LSA is to firstly interpolate irregularly distributed
observations onto a raster map by using either kriging or inverse
distance weighting (IDW). The inherent nature of the weighted moving
averaging of these methods typically subjects the interpolated map to a
smoothing effect. Additionally, the traditional procedure did not allow
for uncertainties on the values of geochemical attributes at unsampled
locations. As such, these two aspects might affect LSA results. This
paper presents a hybrid method, which combines sequential Gaussian
simulation and grid-based LSA to identify geochemical anomalies. A case
study of processing soil samples collected from the Jilinbaolige
district, Inner Mongolia, China, further illustrates the hybrid method
and helps compare the results with those from kriging-based LSA. The
findings indicate that (1) the uncertainties of values at unsampled
locations could affect the results of grid-based LSA, and (2)
singularity exponents from kriging-based LSA roughly represent the trend
(median) of singularity exponent distributions from simulation-based
LSA, but the latter can also provide a measure of uncertainty of
singularity exponent propagated from the uncertain values at unsampled
locations, and (3) the procedure combining simulation-based LSA and
analysis of distance is a feasible way for identifying geochemical
anomalies with uncertainty being considered. The anomaly probability map
obtained can provide a more generalized perspective than
interpolation-based LSA to delineate anomalous areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Analyzing large Earth Observation (EO) data on the broad spatial scales
frequently involves regionalization of patterns. To automate this
process we present a segmentation algorithm designed specifically to
delineate segments containing quasi-stationary patterns. The algorithm
is designed to work with patterns of a categorical variable. This makes
it possible to analyze very large spatial datasets (for example, a
global land cover) in their entirety. An input categorical raster is
first tessellated into small square tiles to form a new, coarser, grid
of tiles. A mosaic of categories within each tile forms a local pattern,
and the segmentation algorithm partitions the grid of tiles while
maintaining the cohesion of pattern in each segment. The algorithm is
based on the principle of seeded region growing (SRG) but it also
includes segment merging and other enhancements to segmentation quality.
Our key contribution is an extension of the concept of segmentation to
grids in which each cell has a non-negligible size and contains a
complex data structure (histograms of pattern features). Specific
modification of a standard SRG algorithm include: working in a distance
space with complex data objects, introducing six-connected “brick wall”
topology of the grid to decrease artifacts associated with tessellation
of geographical space, constructing the SRG priority queue of seeds on
the basis of local homogeneity of patterns, and using a
content-dependent value of segment-growing threshold. The detailed
description of the algorithm is given followed by an assessment of its
performance on test datasets representing three pertinent themes of land
cover, topography, and a high-resolution image. Pattern-based
segmentation algorithm will find application in ecology, forestry,
geomorphology, land management, and agriculture. The algorithm is
implemented as a module of GeoPAT - an already existing, open source
toolbox for performing pattern-based analysis of categorical rasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Possibilities of NMR spectroscopy with C-13 nuclei application to the
study of soil organic matter and its various fractions is considered.
This is a non-destructive method, which is particularly valuable in the
analysis of various fractions of soil organic matter. It is regarded as
a direct method, and, unlike most of indirect methods, it allows one to
obtain reliable estimates of the ratio between virtually all groups of
carbon atoms in different organic molecules, including those in humus
specimens. Owing to impulse technique and high sensitivity, C-13-NMR
spectra may be obtained immediately from soil samples without any
extraction operations. The modern technique of obtaining spectra, their
mathematical processing (Fourier transform), and data interpretation are
considered. The results of applying C-13-NMR to the study of humus
substances, water-soluble fractions of soil organic matter, and soil
litters from different natural zones are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil thickness is a fundamental variable in many earth science
disciplines due to its critical role in many hydrological and ecological
processes, but it is difficult to predict. Here we show a strong linear
relationship (r(2) = 0.87, RMSE = 0.19 m) between soil thickness and
hillslope curvature across both convergent and divergent parts of the
landscape at a field site in Idaho. We find similar linear relationships
across diverse landscapes (n = 6) with the slopes of these relationships
varying as a function of the standard deviation in catchment curvatures.
This soil thickness-curvature approach is significantly more efficient
and just as accurate as kriging-based methods, but requires only
high-resolution elevation data and as few as one soil profile.
Efficiently attained, spatially continuous soil thickness datasets
enable improved models for soil carbon, hydrology, weathering, and
landscape evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Remotely sensed soil moisture retrieved by the Soil Moisture Active and
Passive (SMAP) sensor is currently provided at a 9-km grid resolution.
Although valuable, some applications in weather, agriculture, ecology,
and watershed hydrology require soil moisture at a higher spatial
resolution. In this study, a passive microwave soil moisture downscaling
algorithm based on thermal inertia theory was improved for use with SMAP
and applied to a data set collected at a field experiment. This
algorithm utilizes a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
modulated relationship between daytime soil moisture and daily
temperature change modeled using output variables from the land surface
model of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and
remote sensing data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR). The reference component of the algorithm was developed at the
NLDAS grid size (12.5 km) to downscale the SMAP Level 3 radiometer-based
9-km soil moisture to 1 km. The downscaled results were validated using
data acquired in Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2015
(SMAPVEX15) that included in situ soil moisture and Passive Active
L-band System (PALS) airborne instrument observations. The resulting
downscaled SMAP estimates better characterize soil moisture spatial and
temporal variability and have better overall validation metrics than the
original SMAP soil moisture estimates. Additionally, the overall
accuracy of the downscaled SMAP soil moisture is comparable to the PALS
high spatial resolution soil moisture retrievals. The method
demonstrated in this study downscales satellite soil moisture to produce
a 1-km product that is not site specific and could be applied to other
regions of the world using the publicly available NLDAS/Global Land Data
Assimilation System data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Fine-resolution land cover mapping at the regional or global scale is
usually time-consuming and involves a lot of manual participation. This
article proposes a novel and automatic land cover mapping approach
called the SPatial-tEmporal speCtral Library (SPECLib), which can
produce a land cover map with a 30-m spatial resolution. First, the
SPECLib is developed by extracting reference spectra for uniform,
typical samples of each land cover type by combining the GlobCover2009
land cover product and the 8-day composite MODIS Surface Reflectance
Product (MODO9 A1). SPECLib has a temporal resolution of 8 days and
contains most of the land cover types in each 1.5 degrees x 1.5 degrees
geographic cell. For an arbitrary temporal stage, for each geographical
cell of the SPECLib, there are a total of about 5000 MODIS spectra.
Secondly, an operational approach for automatic land cover mapping using
Landsat data is developed based on SPECLib. For each Landsat scene to be
classified, the reference spectra of the land cover types in the
corresponding geographic cell were automatically extracted and
normalized. The Landsat scene was then classified by using the
normalized reference spectra from SPECLib in an integrated
classification approach that combined MLC (Maximum Likelihood
Classification) and SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper). Finally, the
SPECLib-based approach is tested using 510 single-date Landsat 8 OLI
scenes to produce a land cover map of China. The map was validated using
11,366 interpretation samples and was shown to have an overall accuracy
of 77.34% and a kappa coefficient of 0.729. Therefore, the preliminary
results indicate that the SPECLib-based operational classification
approach is a promisingly automatic method for global land cover mapping
at a resolution of 30 m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Characterising spatial microbial community structure is important to
understand and explain the consequences of continuous plantation of one
crop species on the performance of subsequent crops, especially where
this leads to reduced growth vigour and crop yield. We investigated the
spatial structure, specifically distance-decay of similarity, of soil
bacterial and fungal communities in two long-established orchards with
contrasting agronomic characteristics. A spatially explicit sampling
strategy was used to collect soil from under recently grubbed rows of
apple trees and under the grassed aisles. Amplicon-based metabarcoding
technology was used to characterise the soil microbial communities. The
results suggested that (1) most of the differences in soil microbial
community structure were due to large-scale differences (i.e. between
orchards), (2) within-orchard, small-scale (1-5 m) spatial variability
was also present, but spatial relationships in microbial community
structure differed between orchards and were not predictable, and (3)
vegetation type (i.e. trees or grass and their associated management)
can significantly alter the structure of soil microbial communities,
affecting a large proportion of microbial groups. The discontinuous
nature of soil microbial community structure in the tree stations and
neighbouring grass aisles within an orchard illustrate the importance of
vegetation type and allied weed and nutrient management on soil
microbial community structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil microbial communities play a crucial role in ecosystem functioning,
but it is unknown how co-occurrence networks within these communities
respond to disturbances such as climate extremes. This represents an
important knowledge gap because changes in microbial networks could have
implications for their functioning and vulnerability to future
disturbances. Here, we show in grassland mesocosms that drought promotes
destabilising properties in soil bacterial, but not fungal,
co-occurrence networks, and that changes in bacterial communities link
more strongly to soil functioning during recovery than do changes in
fungal communities. Moreover, we reveal that drought has a prolonged
effect on bacterial communities and their co-occurrence networks via
changes in vegetation composition and resultant reductions in soil
moisture. Our results provide new insight in the mechanisms through
which drought alters soil microbial communities with potential long-term
consequences, including future plant community composition and the
ability of aboveground and belowground communities to withstand future
disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Technological advances have allowed in situ monitoring of soil water
content in an automated manner. These advances, along with an increase
in large-scale networks monitoring soil water content, stress the need
for a robust calibration framework that ensures that soil water content
measurements are accurate and reliable. We have developed an approach to
make consistent and comparable soil water content sensor calibrations
across a continental-scale network in a production framework that
incorporates a thorough accounting of uncertainties. More than 150 soil
blocks of varying characteristics from 33 locations across the United
States were used to generate soil-specific calibration coefficients for
a capacitance sensor. We found that the manufacturer’s nominal
calibration coefficients poorly fit the data for nearly all soil types.
This resulted in negative (91% of samples) and positive (5% of samples)
biases and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 cm(3) cm(-3) (1
sigma) relative to reference standard measurements. We derived
soil-specific coefficients, and when used with the manufacturer’s
nominal function, the biases were corrected and the mean RMSE dropped to
± 0.017 cm(3) cm(-3) (+/- 1 sigma). A logistic calibration function
further reduced the mean RMSE to ± 0.016 cm(3) cm(-3) (+/- 1 sigma)
and increased the range of soil moistures to which the calibration
applied by 18% compared with the manufacturer’s function. However, the
uncertainty of the reference standard was notable (+/- 0.022 cm(3)
cm(-3)), and when propagated in quadrature with RMSE estimates, the
combined uncertainty of the calibrated volumetric soil water content
values increased to ± 0.028 cm(3) cm(-3) regardless of the calibration
function used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Lysimeters are methodological experimental tools to study the water and
matter fluxes in the vadose zone, as well as the environmental fate of
chemicals. Lysimeters are available in various types. The most
sophisticated lysimeters are filled monolithically, are equipped with a
pressure- controlled lower boundary, and are weighable, allowing the
measurement of hydraulic fluxes, i.e., rainfall, drainage,
evapotranspiration, dew, and hoar frost with high precision. This
special section of Vadose Zone Journal reports on current lysimeter
research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Quantifying soil carbon dynamics is of utmost relevance in the context
of global change because soils play an important role in land-atmosphere
gas exchange. Our current understanding of both present and future
carbon dynamics is limited because we fail to accurately represent soil
processes across temporal and spatial scales, partly because of the
paucity of data on the relative importance and hierarchical
relationships between microbial, geochemical and climatic controls.
Here, using observations from a 3,000-kyr-old soil chronosequence
preserved in alluvial terrace deposits of the Merced River, California,
we show how soil carbon dynamics are driven by the relationship between
short-term biotic responses and long-term mineral weathering. We link
temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration to biogeochemical
soil properties through their relationship with microbial activity and
community composition. We found that soil mineralogy, and in particular
changes in mineral reactivity and resulting nutrient availability,
impacts the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to warming by
altering carbon inputs, carbon stabilization, microbial community
composition and extracellular enzyme activity. We demonstrate that
biogeochemical alteration of the soil matrix (and not short-term
warming) controls the composition of microbial communities and
strategies to metabolize nutrients. More specifically, weathering first
increases and then reduces nutrient availability and retention, as well
as the potential of soils to stabilize carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In order to incorporate a range of surface applied materials into the
soil profile to ameliorate crop production constraints, rotary spaders
have recently been adopted in Australia. However, no fundamental studies
have been carried out to quantify the mixing ability of rotary spaders.
The discrete element method (DEM) has the potential to model soil to
rotary spader interaction in terms of soil movement. In this study a
full scale rotary spader was tested in the field and then simulated
using DEM. The DEM model predicted top soil burial to a similar depth in
the soil profile as was measured in the field. A method to compare and
quantify soil movement was also developed using digital image
processing. The forward soil movement which was not examined in the
field was also simulated using DEM and it was found that higher forward
speed increases the bite lengths, and hence results a heterogeneous top
soil mixing. It was also found that in order to carry out a proper
analysis, both cross section and forward soil movement must be
considered while quantifying the mixing ability of the rotary spader.
The results of this study proves that (1) DEM can be used to model soil
to rotary spader interaction to analyse different operation conditions
without time consuming and costly field tests which can only be
performed certain times of the year and (2) digital image processing can
be used as a method to quantify and validate simulations of field
experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Accurate yield estimation and optimised nitrogen management is essential
in agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used
in building decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to
improve yield production and nitrogen management while reducing
operating costs and environmental impact. However, RS based approaches
require processing of enormous amounts of remotely sensed data from
different platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently being
devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability
of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs
and handle non-linear tasks. This paper discusses research developments
conducted within the last 15 years on machine learning based techniques
for accurate crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The
paper concludes that the rapid advances in sensing technologies and ML
techniques will provide cost-effective and comprehensive solutions for
better crop and environment state estimation and decision making. More
targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques, the
fusion of different sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the
development of hybrid systems combining different ML and signal
processing techniques are all likely to be part of precision agriculture
(PA) in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
DNA metabarcoding is promising for cost-effective biodiversity
monitoring, but reliable diversity estimates are difficult to achieve
and validate. Here we present and validate a method, called LULU, for
removing erroneous molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from
community data derived by high-throughput sequencing of amplified marker
genes. LULU identifies errors by combining sequence similarity and
co-occurrence patterns. To validate the LULU method, we use a unique
data set of high quality survey data of vascular plants paired with
plant ITS2 metabarcoding data of DNA extracted from soil from 130 sites
in Denmark spanning major environmental gradients. OTU tables are
produced with several different OTU definition algorithms and
subsequently curated with LULU, and validated against field survey data.
LULU curation consistently improves alpha-diversity estimates and other
biodiversity metrics, and does not require a sequence reference
database; thus, it represents a promising method for reliable
biodiversity estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soils provide a variety of ecosystem services (ESs) that are crucial to
food security, water security, energy security, climate change
abatement, and biodiversity, especially in densely populated countries
such as China. At present, China is facing great challenges from serious
soil heavy metal (HM) contamination which has damaged soil ESs and soil
security. In this paper, we evaluate the ESs that contaminated soils can
potentially provide before and after remediation, and we explore the
connections between these ESs and the achievement of soil security in
China.After an introduction to the concepts of ESs and soil security and
a review of the current status of soil HM contamination in China, the
ESs that can potentially be provided by HM-contaminated soils are
discussed. Finally, we discuss the current remediation status of
HM-contaminated soils from the standpoint of optimizing the ability of
these soils to provide ESs.The status of the provision of ESs by
HM-contaminated soils of croplands, brownfields, and mining wastelands
is described in detail. Contaminated cropland soils fail to provide
provisioning (e.g., food production), cultural, and regulating services,
while the regulating and supporting services of brownfield soils are
greatly reduced. The ESs of mining wasteland soils have been severely
damaged, resulting in a high potential for contamination of surrounding
ecosystems. Recent soil remediation projects have demonstrated that the
damaged ESs of HM-contaminated soils can be restored, which would
enhance Chinese soil security. However, it has often been the case that
only visible ESs (e.g., food production and vegetation cover) are
addressed, while other less noticeable but important services (e.g.,
water quality and biodiversity) are neglected. Therefore, we propose a
framework for the evaluation of ESs provided by HM-contaminated
soils.The ESs that could potentially be provided by HM-contaminated
soils would help to achieve soil security in China, not only by
improving food security, water security, and energy security but also by
helping to protect soil biodiversity and abate global climate change.
The ESs provided by HM-contaminated soils should be taken into account
in soil policy and management systems as well as by the remediation
industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In this paper, I propose a new evenness-based method for calculating
plot-to-plot (dis)similarity coefficients. The method is very flexible,
as (dis)similarity can be calculated for any kind of species abundance
data (also including functional or phylogenetic differences between
species), and can be easily generalized to multiple sites. To show how
the proposed method works in practice, the behavior of two similarity
coefficients based on Pielou’s and Williams’ evenness is examined with
simulated data representing an ideal ecological gradient. Being derived
from classical evenness indices, which have been used in ecology for
decades, this new family of measures has a great potential for future
research in community ecology and multivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Growth in the availability of near-real-time soil moisture observations
from ground-based networks has spurred interest in the assimilation of
these observations into land surface models via a two-dimensional data
assimilation system. However, the design of such systems is currently
hampered by our ignorance concerning the spatial structure of error
afflicting ground and model-based soil moisture estimates. Here we apply
newly developed triple collocation techniques to provide the spatial
error information required to fully parameterize a two-dimensional (2-D)
data assimilation system designed to assimilate spatially sparse
observations acquired from existing ground-based soil moisture networks
into a spatially continuous Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) model
for operational agricultural drought monitoring. Over the contiguous
United States (CONUS), the posterior uncertainty of surface soil
moisture estimates associated with this 2-D system is compared to that
obtained from the 1-D assimilation of remote sensing retrievals to
assess the value of ground-based observations to constrain a surface
soil moisture analysis. Results demonstrate that a fourfold increase in
existing CONUS ground station density is needed for ground network

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from any given
land cover or crop type is important for irrigation water management and
agricultural water consumption analysis. The main parameter used for
such estimations is the crop coefficient (K-c). Spectral reflectance
indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and
the crop coefficient of a specific crop or pasture canopy are important
indicators of ‘vigour’, namely the photosynthetic activity and rate of
biomass accumulation. Measuring both parameters simultaneously, with a
view to understanding how they interact, or for creating optical,
surrogate indicators of K-c is very difficult because K-c itself is
difficult to measure. In this study a portable enclosed chamber was used
to measure ET, of a pasture and subsequently calculated K-c from
reference evapotranspiration (ETc) data derived from a nearby automatic
weather station (AWS). Calibration of the chamber confirms the
suitability of the device to measure the amount of water vapour produced
by local plant evapotranspiration, producing a calibration factor (C)
close to 1 (C = 1.02, R-2 = 0.87). The coincident NDVI values were
measured using a portable active optical sensor. In a test involving a
pasture (Festuca arundinacea var. Dovey) at two different stages of
growth in two consecutive growing seasons, the NDVI and crop
coefficients were observed to be strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.80 and
0.77, respectively). A polynomial regression (R-2 = 0.84) was found to
be the best fit for the combined, multi-temporal KC-NDVI relationship.
The main advantages of this method include the suitability of operating
at a smaller scale (&amp;lt; 1 m(2)), in real time and repeatability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
For the purpose of classifying tea varieties, allied Gustafson-Kessel
(AGK) clustering was proposed to cluster the Fourier transform infrared
reflectance (FTIR) spectra of tea samples. As a fuzzy clustering
algorithm, AGK can not only produce fuzzy membership and typicality
values but also cluster various shapes of data with the help of
Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering. After FTIR spectra were collected by
FTIR-7600 infrared spectrometer, they were preprocessed with multiple
scatter correction (MSC). To reduce the dimensionality of FTIR spectra
and make the classification of data easily, principal component analysis
(PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to process the
FTIR spectra. After that, fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, possibilistic
c-means (PCM) clustering, AGK clustering and allied fuzzy c-means (AFCM)
clustering were performed to cluster data, respectively. The clustering
accuracy of AGK achieved 93.9% which was the highest one than other
fuzzy clustering algorithms. The results obtained in experiments showed
that AGK coupled with FTIR spectroscopy could provide an effective
discrimination model for classification of tea varieties successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Queensland grazing industries operate in one of the world’s most
variable climates and face enormous challenges to achieve profitability
and sustainability. To assist grazing enterprises, the Queensland
Government has developed an operational online information system -
FORAGE, to facilitate best management practice for grazing land. The
FORAGE system provides land managers with property-scale information
relating to rainfall, ground cover, soil erodibility, land types, tree
density, seasonal climate outlooks and pasture growth simulated using
the GRASP grazing system model. This information is site-specific and
tailored to facilitate on-ground management decisions common to
Queensland grazing enterprises. The FORAGE system makes complex
remotely-sensed data, information from a range of databases and pasture
growth models more accessible and relevant to land managers. This paper
describes the structure, resources (e.g. software, databases and
models), information generating processes, delivery mechanisms and
information products of the FORAGE system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Tree-ring analysis is widely used in many different fields of science.
Among others, information carried by annual tree rings allows
determining the rates of environmental changes and the timing of events.
The analysis of the tree rings requires prior detection of tree-ring
boundaries which is traditionally performed manually with the use of
stereoscope, a moving table, and a data recorder. This is, however,
time-consuming and very cumbersome, especially in the case of long
tree-ring series. Several approaches to an automatic detection of
tree-ring boundaries exist; however, they use basic image processing
techniques. As a result, their accuracy is limited, and their
application is restricted mainly to conifer wood where the tree-ring
boundaries are clearly defined. There also exists some commercial
software, however, none of them is perfect as they fail when applied to
the ring-porous wood type. Therefore this paper proposes a DeepDendro
approach i.e., an automatic tree-ring boundary detector built upon the
U-Net convolutional network. To the authors’ best knowledge this is the
first study which applies ConvNets for an automatic detection of tree
rings. The performance of the existing approach was tested on the
dataset of images of wood cores of three species that represent the
ring-porous type of the anatomical structure (Quercus sp., Fraxinus
excelsior L., and Ulmus sp.). The testing dataset contained over 2500 of
tree-ring boundaries, 96% of which were determined correctly by the
proposed method. The corresponding precision is at the level of 0.97
which confirms that only a few false boundaries were introduced by the
DeepDendro approach. The results were obtained automatically without any
user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The soil water retention curve (SWRC) is an essential hydraulic function
for the understanding and modelling of soil hydraulic processes. Its
direct determination is time consuming and sometimes expensive because
it requires extensive sampling, especially when spatial and temporal
variation of soil hydraulic properties are an issue. The use of
pedotransfer functions (PTFs) is a viable alternative to predict the
parameters of SWRC from more easily determined soil attributes. Splintex
is a physically based engineering model containing two PTFs to estimate
SWRC parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity, but its
performance and functionality have not yet been fully evaluated and
disseminated for soil science. We examined the functionality of the PTFs
available in Splintex to estimate parameters of the Van Genuchten-Mualem
(VGM) SWRC equation with a laboratory-measured dataset containing
information on particle size, bulk and particle density, saturated water
content and parameters of the SWRCs. In addition, we tested the
performance of both PTFs for deriving some soil physical-structural
variables calculated from estimated SWRC parameters. Compared with VGM
parameters fitted to the laboratory dataset, the model performed well.
Its predictive performance for soil air capacity, relative field
capacity and soil physical-structural quality indices was also
evaluated. The performance of Splintex for estimating the VGM parameters
depended on the combined effect of all input variables rather than on
isolated correlations between an input variable and a model parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Monitoring biodiversity is essential for the conservation and management
of forest resources. A method called “spectranomics” that maps the
diversity of forest species based on species-driven leaf optical traits
using imaging spectroscopy has been developed for tropical forests in
earlier studies. In this study we applied the “spectranomics” method in
combination with airborne hyperspectral (PHI-3 sensor with 1 m spatial
resolution) and LiDAR ( &amp;gt; 4 points/m(2)) data to first identify
interspecies variations in biochemical and structural properties of
trees and then estimate the tree species diversity within the
Shennongjia Forest Nature Reserve in China. Firstly, we used the
watershed algorithm based on morphological crown control to isolate
individual tree crowns (ITCs) from the LiDAR data. For each ITC, we then
calculated seven vegetation indices (VIs) representing key biochemical
properties from the hyperspectral data and additionally derived the
LiDAR-based tree height which was identified to support the
discrimination of the tree species in a preceding analysis. Finally we
utilized the combination of the seven selected VIs and tree height as
input to a self-adaptive Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The
FCM algorithm was applied to fixed subsets of 30 m x 30 m and it was
assumed that the number of clusters identified within a subset
represents the number of occurring species. The species richness and
Shannon-Wiener diversity index calculated from the clustering outputs
correlated well with the field reference data (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.25).
The results show that forest species diversity can be directly predicted
using the suggested clustering method based on crown-by-crown variations
in biochemical and structural properties in the examined subtropical
forest without the need to distinguish the individual tree species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
While remote sensing has increasingly been applied to estimate a
biodiversity directly through optical diversity, there is a need to
better understand the mechanisms behind the optical
diversity-biodiversity relationship. Here, we examined the relative
contributions of species richness, evenness, and composition to the
spectral reflectance, and consider factors confounding the remote
estimation of species diversity in a prairie ecosystem experiment at
Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota. We collected
hyperspectral reflectance of 16 prairie species using a tram-mounted
imaging spectrometer, and a full-range field spectrometer with a leaf
clip, and simulated plot-level images from both instruments with
different species richness, evenness and composition. Two optical
diversity metrics were explored: the coefficient of variation (CV) of
spectral reflectance in space and classified species derived from
Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), a spectral
classification method. Both optical diversity metrics (CV and PLS-DA
classified species) were affected by species richness and evenness.
Diversity metrics that combined species richness and evenness together
(e.g. Shannon’s index) were more strongly correlated with optical
diversity than either metric alone. Image-derived data were influenced
by both leaf traits and canopy structure and showed larger spectral
variability than leaf clip data, indicating that sampling methods
influence optical diversity. Leaf and canopy traits both contributed to
optical diversity, sometimes in complex or contradictory ways. Large
within-species variation sometimes confounded biodiversity estimation
from optical diversity, and a single species markedly altered the
optical-biodiversity relationship. Biodiversity estimation from CV was
strongly influenced by soil background, while estimation from PLS-DA
classified species was not sensitive to soil background. These findings
are consistent with recent empirical studies and demonstrate that
modeling approaches can be used to explore effects of spatial scale and
guide regional studies of biodiversity estimation using high spatial and
spectral resolution remote sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY&lt;/em&gt;, 24 (6):2403-2415; JUN 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Climate change threatens global wheat production and food security,
including the wheat industry in Australia. Many studies have examined
the impacts of changes in local climate on wheat yield per hectare, but
there has been no assessment of changes in land area available for
production due to changing climate. It is also unclear how total wheat
production would change under future climate when autonomous adaptation
options are adopted. We applied species distribution models to
investigate future changes in areas climatically suitable for growing
wheat in Australia. A crop model was used to assess wheat yield per
hectare in these areas. Our results show that there is an overall
tendency for a decrease in the areas suitable for growing wheat and a
decline in the yield of the northeast Australian wheat belt. This
results in reduced national wheat production although future climate
change may benefit South Australia and Victoria. These projected
outcomes infer that similar wheat-growing regions of the globe might
also experience decreases in wheat production. Some cropping adaptation
measures increase wheat yield per hectare and provide significant
mitigation of the negative effects of climate change on national wheat
production by 2041-2060. However, any positive effects will be
insufficient to prevent a likely decline in production under a high CO2
emission scenario by 2081-2100 due to increasing losses in suitable
wheat-growing areas. Therefore, additional adaptation strategies along
with investment in wheat production are needed to maintain Australian
agricultural production and enhance global food security. This scenario
analysis provides a foundation towards understanding changes in
Australia’s wheat cropping systems, which will assist in developing
adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on global wheat
production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT&lt;/em&gt;, 34 (1):134-146; MAR 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
It has long been realized that the conservation of soil capital and
ecosystem services are of paramount importance, resulting in a growing
case for a change in attitude and policymaking in respect of soils.
Current UK and EU approaches are risk-based and focused on measures to
manage and remediate the adverse impact of current policies and
practices directed at maximizing productivity and profit, rather than
one of resource conservation. Increasing soil loss and degradation is
evidence that current policy is not working and a new approach is
needed. In the UK there is governmental ambition to progress towards
natural capital-led land use policies but, in the absence of a framework
to determine the relative condition of the soil resource, the delivery
of sustainable soil conservation policies will continue to be inhibited.
Common Standards Monitoring (CSM) is an established monitoring and
management framework (based on ecosystem structure, function and
process) and has been effectively deployed for almost two decades by the
UK Government for the monitoring and reporting of key biological and
earth science natural capital and ecosystem services from field’ to
local, regional and national levels to the European Commission. It is
argued that a CSM for soils could be developed for the UK’s soil
resources as well as for those elsewhere, and would be able to deliver a
conservation rather than the current risk-based approach. It is capable
of accommodating the complexities and variation in soil types and
functions and potentially being practical and cost-effective in its
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Since the introduction of the cosmic-ray neutron method for soil
moisture estimation, numerous studies have been conducted to test and
advance the accuracy of the method. Almost 200 stationary neutron
detector systems have been installed worldwide, and roving systems have
also started to gain ground. The intensity of low-energy neutrons
produced by cosmic rays, measured above the ground surface, is sensitive
to soil moisture in the upper decimeters of the ground within a radius
of hectometers. The method has been proven suitable for estimating soil
moisture for a wide range of land covers and soil types and has been
used for hydrological modeling, data assimilation, and calibration and
validation of satellite products. The method is challenged by the effect
on neutron intensity of other hydrogen pools such as vegetation, canopy
interception, and snow. Identifying the signal of the different pools
can be used to improve the cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture method as
well as extend the application to, e.g., biomass and canopy interception
surveying. More fundamental research is required for advancement of the
method to include more energy ranges and consider multiple height
levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Bauxite residue is an alkaline, saline-sodic byproduct of the Bayer
process for alumina production. In situ remediation of bauxite residue
is a cost-effective management strategy that transforms the residue into
a soil-like medium; however, the effects of applied amendments on
trajectories and progress of soil formation over the medium-long term
are unclear. Here, we investigated how in situ remediation amendments
guided the progress and trajectories of soil formation in bauxite
residue over 20 years.Chemical and mineralogical properties of samples
from a field site in Corpus Christi, Texas, were analyzed to compare the
effects of three different amendments (sewage sludge, yard waste, and
topsoil) on progress and trajectories of soil formation in bauxite
residue. Bauxite residue was deposited ca. 40 years prior to sampling;
amendments were applied at varying frequencies for 20 years prior to
sampling.Sewage sludge was the most effective amendment for decreasing
pH, EC, and total alkalinity of bauxite residue and increasing plant
nutrients and exchangeable cations. Overall soil development is in an
early stage; however, incipient soil horizons were identified from
differences in chemical and mineralogical properties with depth.
Although amendment type influenced the progress of soil formation, it
did not appear to influence the overall trajectory of soil formation
processes. Soil derived from the bauxite residue parent material is
likely to progress from a spolic Technosol to a technic Cambisol and
finally either a Ferralsol or Luvisol depending on organic matter
dynamics.Long-term impacts of amendments were consistent with those
observed in previous short-term studies, with some outcomes improving
further over the long term (e.g., Na+ leaching) and were realized to a
depth enabling maintenance of a vegetation cover. These outcomes provide
strong support for the use of in situ remediation as an alternative to
soil capping that enables transformation of bauxite residue to a soil
capable of supporting a self-sustaining ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Environmental pollution is a great concern worldwide. The soil
environment, an important compartment for global elemental cycling, has
received tremendous research focuses over the past 20 years. This study
investigated the current research activities in the field of
contaminated soil remediation and determined the trend of research
topics.We performed a quantitative bibliometric analysis based on
journal articles published within the past 20 years using the Science
Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index databases on the Web
of Science. To further analyze the publication performance and identify
the major soil contamination topics, we employed social network analysis
and S-curve predictions.Chemosphere and Journal of Hazardous Materials
were the most productive journals with a total of 433 and 431 articles
from 1996 to 2015 on contaminated soil remediation, respectively. China
had the largest amount of publications (n = 1518) and the Chinese
Academy of Science was the most prominent institution (n = 475). Keyword
analysis further identified the most studied soil pollutants, such as
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, crude oil, and heavy metals, in the
top five productive countries, including China, USA, Spain, India, and
Canada. Moreover, soil remediation technologies, including microbial
remediation, phytoremediation, and electrokinetic remediation, were the
major technologies receiving increasing interest in the results of the
prediction analysis.Our results identified the hotspots and developing
trends of contaminated soil remediation studies and provide guidance for
future research directions. However, transitions from the laboratory to
field implementations are still required. Bibliometric analysis,
combined with patent analysis, social network analysis, and S-curve
prediction, is a useful tool to provide a quantitative measurement of
research activities in the past and present, enabling a prediction on
the future study of soil remediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
An advanced estimation model CARS-PLS (competitive adaptive reweighted
sampling-partial least squares) has been developed for feature
extraction and soil contamination analysis. However, this method works
well for a single mining area and has limited capacity in coping with
the variations from multiple sites. In this paper, we present an
improved estimation model, CARS-PLS-SVM, to cope with the nonlinear
problem in multiple sites with SVM (support vector machines).We selected
two study areas located in metal mining and coal mining areas of north
China. A total of 65 soil samples were collected. The heavy metal(loid)
concentrations (Cr and As) were determined by inductively coupled
plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic fluorescence spectrometry
(AFS), and the visible and near-infrared spectra of the soil samples
were measured with an ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices) field
spectrometer (350-2500 nm). Samples were divided into calibration set (n
= 41) and validation set (m = 24) according to heavy metal(loid)
concentration. After different pretreatment methods, the new features
extracted from CARS-PLS are used as the input to model the data further
with SVMs.The performance of CARS-PLS-SVM was investigated under seven
different pretreatment methods. Results showed that using combination of
Savitzky-Golay and standard normal transformation pretreatment method
achieved the best accuracy for Cr estimation (coefficient of
determination for prediction, R (p) (2) = 0.9705, root-mean-square error
for prediction, RMSEP = 5.0253, residual prediction deviation, RPD =
5.9001, ratio of prediction performance to interquartile range, RPIQ =
11.4043) and for As prediction (R (p) (2) = 0.9483; RMSEP = 1.2024; RPD
= 3.0689; RPIQ = 5.3643). Besides, CARS-PLS-SVM is better than partial
least squares (PLS) regression under the same pretreatment methods.
Compared with three current state-of-the-art models: wavelet transform
PLS (WT-PLS), synergy interval PLS (siPLS), and the CARS-PLS model,
CARS-PLS-SVM was found to be superior to the other methods for Cr
prediction (R (p) (2) = 0.9705; RMSEP = 5.0253; RPD = 5.9001; RPIQ =
11.4043) and As prediction (R (p) (2) = 0.9483; RMSEP = 1.2024; RPD =
3.0689; RPIQ = 11.5.3643).The results demonstrate that compared with
other linear models, the nonlinear model CARS-PLS-SVM has the highest
precision in soil heavy metal(loid) estimation modeling of multiple
mining areas by the use of proper spectral feature extraction from the
pretreated spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Global-scale surface soil moisture products are currently available from multiple remote sensing platforms. Footprint-scale assessments of these products are generally restricted to limited number of densely-instrumented validation sites. However, by taking active and passive soil moisture products together with a third independent soil moisture estimates via land surface modeling, triple collocation (TC) can be applied to estimate the correlation metric of satellite soil moisture products (versus an unknown ground truth) over a quasi-global domain. Here, an assessment of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture retrievals via TC is presented. Considering the potential violation of TC error assumptions, the impact of active-passive and satellite-model error cross correlations on the TC-derived inter-comparison results is examined at in situ sites using quadruple collocation analysis. In addition, confidence intervals for the TC-estimated correlation metric are constructed from moving-block bootstrap sampling designed to preserve the temporal persistence of the original (unevenly-sampled) soil moisture time series. This study is the first to apply TC to obtain a robust global-scale cross-assessment of SMAP, SMOS and ASCAT soil moisture retrieval accuracy in terms of anomaly temporal correlation. Our results confirm the overall advantage of SMAP (with a global average anomaly correlation of 0.76) over SMOS
(0.66) and ASCAT (0.63) that has been established in several recent regional, ground-based studies. SMAP is also the best-performing product over the majority of applicable land pixels (52%), although SMOS and ASCAT each shows advantage in distinct geographic regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The availability of remote sensing images of various resolutions has enabled the incorporation of landscape structures in land-cover mapping.
Despite the effectiveness of landscape metrics in quantifying landscape structures, they are inadequate in characterizing three elements:
spatial neighborhoods, spatial dependencies, and semantic dependencies.
Moreover, methods for mining the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity (i.e., spatial variations in landscape structures) are still limited, particularly for applications in urban land-cover mapping. This study hence proposes a novel approach with the aims to (1) characterize landscape structures considering the above three elements;
(2) mine the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity; and (3) apply landscape-structure information as contexts to improve urban land-cover mapping. To achieve the first aim, landscape-structure features including pair-wise spatial relationships and neighborhood-based landscape metrics are defined. To accomplish the second aim, a clustering technique and a landscape infographic are used to cluster landscape structures and visualize landscape-structure types, respectively. Finally, a hierarchical classifier based on the feedforward multi-layer perceptron is developed for the third aim.
Experiments are conducted in a heterogeneous urban environment in Beijing, China. The results show that the proposed approach, which considers 34 landscape-structure features and 19 landscape-structure types, achieves a classification accuracy improvement of 6.43% compared with the approaches without considering landscape-structure information.
This study therefore demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating landscape-structure features and landscape-structure types in improving urban land-cover mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Urban land-use mapping is a significant yet challenging task in the field of remote sensing. Although numerous classification methods have been developed for obtaining land-use information in urban areas, the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are insufficient to meet the requirements of real-world applications such as urban planning and land management. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), have achieved an astonishing level of performance in image classification. However, the traditional DCNN methods do not focus on multispectral remote sensing images with more than three channels, and they are limited by their training samples. In addition, these methods uniformly decompose large images into small processing units, which chop up the land-use patterns and produce land-use maps with obvious “blocks”. In this study, a semi-transfer deep convolutional neural network (STDCNN) approach is proposed to overcome these weaknesses. The proposed STDCNN has three parts: one part involves a transferred DCNN with deep architecture; another part is designed to analyze multispectral images; and the final part fuses the first two parts into a classification layer. Moreover, a skeleton-based decomposing method using street block data is devised to maintain the integrity of the land-use patterns. In two case studies, the proposed method is used to generate urban land-use maps from a WorldView-3 image of a 143 km(2) area of Hong Kong and a WorldView-2 image of a 25 km(2) area of Shenzhen. The results show that the proposed STDCNN obtains an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.25% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.903 for Hong Kong land-use classification, and an OA of 80% and a Kappa of
0.780 for Shenzhen land-use classification. In addition, due to the proposed skeleton-based decomposition method, the proposed method can produce better land-use maps for real-world urban applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
NASA’s Black Marble nighttime lights product suite (VNP46) is available at 500 m resolution since January 2012 with data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Platform (SNPP). The retrieval algorithm, developed and implemented for routine global processing at NASA’s Land Science Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS), utilizes all high-quality, cloud-free, atmospheric-, terrain-, vegetation-, snow-, lunar-, and stray light-corrected radiances to estimate daily nighttime lights (NTL) and other intrinsic surface optical properties.
Key algorithm enhancements include: (1) lunar irradiance modeling to resolve non-linear changes in phase and libration; (2) vector radiative transfer and lunar bidirectional surface anisotropic reflectance modeling to correct for atmospheric and BRDF effects; (3) geometric-optical and canopy radiative transfer modeling to account for seasonal variations in NTL; and (4) temporal gap-filling to reduce persistent data gaps. Extensive benchmark tests at representative spatial and temporal scales were conducted on the VNP46 time series record to characterize the uncertainties stemming from upstream data sources. Initial validation results are presented together with example case studies illustrating the scientific utility of the products. This includes an evaluation of temporal patterns of NTL dynamics associated with urbanization, socioeconomic variability, cultural characteristics, and displaced populations affected by conflict. Current and planned activities under the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Human Planet Initiative are aimed at evaluating the products at different geographic locations and time periods representing the full range of retrieval conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Delimitation of soil types within a farm field is key for site-specific
crop management. An alternative to this, is to develop pedometric
techniques that allow an efficient combination of soil survey
information and high-resolution terrain attribute data. The aim of this
study was to present and evaluate a pedometric technique to delimit
soil-specific zones at field scale by coupled Random forest, fuzzy
k-means clustering and spatial principal components algorithms
(RF-KM-sPCA) and by using information from soil surveys and terrain
attributes derived from a digital elevation model. The protocol involves
three-steps: 1) automatic classification of small (20x20m) spatial units
(SU) using the knowledge of the soil map units present in the farm
landscape, 2) aggregation of SUM at farm scale and 3) validation of
soil-specific zones. For the first step, we used the random forest
algorithm with 10 terrain attributes. For the second step, KM-sPCA
algorithms were used to cluster within field SU accounting for
autocorrelation. For the third step, apparent soil electrical
conductivity and yield maps was used to validate the delimitation of
soil-specific zones. This technique produced more contiguous zones than
other cluster methods which do not use spatiality. Six farm fields with
highly differences in soils were partitioned by the proposed pedometric
strategy. Apparent soil electrical conductivity and yield maps present
significant differences among zones in all experimental fields. This
analytic strategy, based in easy-to-obtain data, could be used to
improve precision agricultural managements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil Security is a holistic soil assessment approach that cogitates soil
as a multi-dimensional medium. Rather than traditional single
dimensional assessment approaches such as land capability mapping that
largely considers only soil and landscape biophysical attributes, the
Soil Security concept considers social aspects, education, policy,
legislation, current land use, condition and the soils natural and
economic value to society. It can identify discrete soils that are
currently being used within their capacity, and areas where a use might
be unsustainable, i.e. not secure. It would therefore make sense to map
this concept, which aligns well with the aspirational and marketing
policies of the Tasmanian Government, where increased agricultural
expansion through new irrigation schemes and multiple-use State managed
production forests co-exists beside pristine World Heritage conservation
land, a major drawcard of the economically important tourism industry.
The spatial quantification of soil security is seen as an emerging tool
to effectively protect the soil resource in terms of food and water
security, biodiversity maintenance and safeguarding fragile ecosystems.
The recent development and application of Digital Soil Mapping and
Assessment capacities in Tasmania to stimulate agricultural production
and better target appropriate soil resource use has formed the
foundational system that can enable the first efforts in quantifying and
mapping Soil Security, in particular the five Soil Security dimensions
(Capability, Condition, Capital, Codification and Connectivity). This
forms a preliminary mapping product that demonstrates the feasibility of
mapping the Soil Security concept. To provide a measure of overall soil
security, it was necessary to separately assess the State’s three major
soil uses; Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. These outputs provide
an indication of where different activities are sustainable or at risk,
where more soil data is needed, and develops a tool to better plan for a
State requiring optimal food and fibre production, without depleting its
natural soil resources and impacting the fragile ecosystems providing
environmental benefits and supporting the tourism industry. The
following paper demonstrates why and how we might map Soil Security,
describing a preliminary approach to mapping the separate dimensions;
this approach could be adapted and applied elsewhere as an evaluation
tool to identify soil threats relevant to current land use, biophysical
properties, policy and management, and stimulate further research and
debate into developing a global Soil Security mapping methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Microplastics (&amp;lt; 5 mm) are considered to be emerging pollutants of
global concern. Investigations on microplastics pollution in coastal and
marine environments have increased recently but knowledge gaps still
exist regarding microplastics in coastal beach soils with high-intensity
human activities. In the present study a total of 120 soil samples were
taken from 53 sites along &amp;gt; 3000 km of coastline in Shandong province,
east China, adjacent to both the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea coastlines
under different land use management. Microplastics were separated from
the soil samples using a continuous flow and floating separation
apparatus. The shape type, size, abundance, spatial distribution,
polymer composition and surface morphology of the microplastics were
identified by a range of advanced microscopic and micro-analytical
methods. The analytical results show that seven shape types, namely
foams, pellets, fragments, flakes, fibers, films and sponges, were
present in the beach soils. The polymer composition of the microplastics
included polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, poly-ether urethane
and a polymer blend of both polyethylene and polypropylene.
Approximately 60% of the observed microplastics had a size range &amp;lt; 1 mm.
Microplastic abundance varied greatly among the soils, ranging from 1.3
to 14,712.5 N kg(-1) (dry weight) as influenced by high-intensity human
activities such as mariculture, tourism, and port construction. The
seven shape types of microplastics from the coastal environment had
different weathering surface morphologies, showing scratches, creases,
micropores, cracks, either concave or convex, and of various shapes and
sizes, possibly due to physical friction, photochemical oxidation and/or
animal attack. Algae or crude oil was observed on the surface of some
microplastics. The weathered surfaces of microplastics might act as a
high-capacity carrier with adhering microorganisms and chemicals.
Further studies are required on the weathering processes, sorption
capacity and transport of microplastics especially in smaller size (&amp;lt; 1
mm) under coastal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Large defects in the spatial structure of agricultural land are an issue
in many countries. The main cause of these defects are hundreds of years
of social, economic and historical transformations. The spatial
structure of farmland can be improved using procedures such as land
consolidation and exchange. However, given the fact that the funds for
these activities are limited, it is necessary to select those areas in
which land consolidation and exchange are a priority. To develop a
prioritization plan for land consolidation and exchange interventions,
it is necessary to carry out a series of studies and analyses which will
provide a set of factors characterizing the region under investigation.
Many years of research have shown that different regions in Poland are
characterized by different parameters.Therefore, in the present study,
an attempt was made to develop a universal algorithm for selecting
groups of factors for purposes of prioritization of land consolidation
which takes into account the geographic location of an investigated
area. To test the proposed algorithm, analyses were carried out in two
communes located in central and south-eastern Poland which differed
significantly in terms of the spatial structure of farm holdings. A
first test object was the commune of Paradyz, occupying an area of
8125.73 ha and divided into 15,941 cadastral plots. A second test object
was the commune of Frysztak, located in south-eastern Poland, with an
area of 9066.86 ha, divided into 21,506 cadastral plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
While remote sensing has increasingly been applied to estimate a
biodiversity directly through optical diversity, there is a need to
better understand the mechanisms behind the optical
diversity-biodiversity relationship. Here, we examined the relative
contributions of species richness, evenness, and composition to the
spectral reflectance, and consider factors confounding the remote
estimation of species diversity in a prairie ecosystem experiment at
Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota. We collected
hyperspectral reflectance of 16 prairie species using a tram-mounted
imaging spectrometer, and a full-range field spectrometer with a leaf
clip, and simulated plot-level images from both instruments with
different species richness, evenness and composition. Two optical
diversity metrics were explored: the coefficient of variation (CV) of
spectral reflectance in space and classified species derived from
Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), a spectral
classification method. Both optical diversity metrics (CV and PLS-DA
classified species) were affected by species richness and evenness.
Diversity metrics that combined species richness and evenness together
(e.g. Shannon’s index) were more strongly correlated with optical
diversity than either metric alone. Image-derived data were influenced
by both leaf traits and canopy structure and showed larger spectral
variability than leaf clip data, indicating that sampling methods
influence optical diversity. Leaf and canopy traits both contributed to
optical diversity, sometimes in complex or contradictory ways. Large
within-species variation sometimes confounded biodiversity estimation
from optical diversity, and a single species markedly altered the
optical-biodiversity relationship. Biodiversity estimation from CV was
strongly influenced by soil background, while estimation from PLS-DA
classified species was not sensitive to soil background. These findings
are consistent with recent empirical studies and demonstrate that
modeling approaches can be used to explore effects of spatial scale and
guide regional studies of biodiversity estimation using high spatial and
spectral resolution remote sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Radar data have been used to retrieve and monitor the surface soil
moisture (SM) changes in various conditions. However, the calibration of
radar models whether empirically or physically-based, is still subject
to large uncertainties especially at high-spatial resolution. To help
calibrate radar-based retrieval approaches to supervising SM at high
resolution, this paper presents an innovative synergistic method
combining Sentinel-1 (Si) microwave and Landsat-7/8 (L7/8) thermal data.
First, the S1 backscatter coefficient was normalized by its maximum and
minimum values obtained during 2015-2016 agriculture season. Second, the
normalized S1 backscatter coefficient was calibrated from reference
points provided by a thermal-derived SM proxy named soil evaporative
efficiency (SEE, defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil
evaporation). SEE was estimated as the radiometric soil temperature
normalized by its minimum and maximum values reached in a
water-saturated and dry soil, respectively. We estimated both soil
temperature endmembers by using a soil energy balance model forced by
available meteorological forcing. The proposed approach was evaluated
against in situ SM measurements collected over three bare soil fields in
a semi-arid region in Morocco and we compared it against a classical
approach based on radar data only. The two polarizations VV (vertical
transmit and receive) and VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive)
of the S1 data available over the area are tested to analyse the
sensitivity of radar signal to SM at high incidence angles (39
degrees-43 degrees). We found that the VV polarization was better
correlated to SM than the VH polarization with a determination
coefficient of 0.47 and 0.28, respectively. By combining Si (VV) and
L7/8 data, we reduced the root mean square difference between satellite
and in situ SM to 0.03 m(3) m(-3) which is far smaller than 0.16 m(3)
m(-3) when using SI (VV) only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has recently been proposed for
estimation of soil moisture using only optical remote sensing data. The
model relies on a physical linear relationship between the soil moisture
content and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (SIR) and can be
parameterized universally (i.e., a single calibration for a given area)
based on the pixel distribution within the STR-Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) trapezoidal space. The main motivation for this
study was to evaluate how the universal parameterization of OPTRAM works
for long periods of time (e.g., several decades). This is especially
relevant for uncovering the soil moisture and agricultural drought
history in response to climate change in different regions. In this
study, MODIS satellite observations from 2001 to 2017 were acquired and
used for the analysis. Cosmic ray neutron (CRN) soil moisture data,
collected with the Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) at
five different sites in the U.S. covering diverse climates, soil types,
and land covers, were applied for evaluation of the MODIS-OPTRAM-based
soil moisture estimates. The OPTRAM soil moisture estimates were further
compared to the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) (L-band), the
Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) (L band), and the Advanced
AScatterometer (ASCAT) (C-band) soil moisture retrievals. OPTRAM soil
moisture data were also analyzed for potential monitoring of
agricultural drought through comparison of the OPTRAM-based Soil Water
Deficit Index (OPTRAM-SWDI) with the widely-applied Crop Moisture Index
(CMI). Evaluation results indicate that OPTRAM-based soil moisture
estimates provide overall unbiased RMSE and R between 0.050 and 0.085
cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.10 to 0.70, respectively, for all investigated sites.
The performance of OPTRAM is comparable with the ASCAT retrievals, but
slightly less accurate than SMAP and SMOS. OPTRAM and the three
microvave satellites captured CRN soil moisture temporal dynamics very
well for all five investigated sites. A close agreement was observed
between the OPTRAM-SWDI and CMI drought indices for most selected sites.
In conclusion, OPTRAM can estimate temporal soil moisture dynamics with
reasonable accuracy for a range of climatic conditions (semi-arid to
humid), soil types, and land covers, and can potentially be applied for
agricultural drought monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Point pattern analysis of collapsed pipes as a subsurface erosion in
natural and manmade conditions plays an important role to understand
their landforms/features, predisposing factors, and for prevention and
forecasting purposes. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the
spatial pattern and the associated land factors of piping erosion in
loess-derived soils in a semiarid climate in Golestan Province, Iran by
applying numerical summary statistics. To this end, a 105 ha area with
homogeneous environmental conditions (gentle slope and loess-derived
soil) was selected and the maps related to 101 collapsed pipes and their
features were obtained by the aerial photos provided by an unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) with a 50 cm resolution and field survey. The mean
of spatial distances between pipe locations was 309 m, and the frequency
of pipes per hectare was 0.97. Moreover, soil samples of the pipe
locations were collected and physical-chemical soil properties were
measured in laboratory. Approximately 95% simulation envelopes were
selected using the 5th-lowest and 5th-highest values of 199 Monte Carlo
simulations of the null model of homogeneous complete spatial
randomness. Based on the results of univariate pair correlation
function, the significant aggregation of 101 collapsed pipes was
observed at a scale of 0-50 m in both rangeland and agricultural land
use types. The bivariate pair correlation function, which is considered
to be the most informative second-order summary characteristic, was used
for analyzing the statistical correlations between collapsed pipes and
linear phenomena including distance from drainage networks, ridges, and
roads. Based on bivariate summary statistics, collapsed pipes had
positively been affected by both the distribution of drainage networks
and ridges. However, the negative statistical correlations occurred
between pipes and roads at the scales of 1-50 m. Also, the correlations
of soil characteristics (silt content, exchangeable sodium percentage
(ESP), the weight of soil in a given volume (bulk density), soil
electrical conductivity (EC), and organic matter (O.M.)) of neighboring
collapsed pipes were evaluated by mark correlation function. Based on
mark correlation function k(mm)(r), a significantly positive correlation
was found between the pipes density and silt content, ESP, and bulk
density, when they are more than overall average. In addition, less
values of EC and O.M. were positively related to the aggregation of
collapsed pipes. Similar to the results of summary statistics, the maps
confirmed all statistical correlations. Consequently, the outcome of
this study highlights the spatial pattern of collapsed pipes and their
associations in the study area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The protection of pedodiversity is very important for biodiversity
maintenance and food production. However, where and how large should the
protection focus on in a given region (especially in mountain regions
with complex environment) remains unclear. In this study, geostatistical
analysis was used to study pedodiversity indexes (Shannon’s index, the
maximum Shannon’s index, Richness index and Evenness index) in Taihang
Mountain region in North China. Then pedodiversity protection and buffer
zones were designed. Moreover, the relationship between protection zone
and human activities was determined. The results showed that average
Shannon’s index for the study area was 1.72, with two lower value zones
appeared in the north and the south of Taihang Mountain region,
respectively. This suggested that there was the need to enhance the
protection of pedodiversity in the two regions. The ranges of the
Richness index and the Shannon’s index were respectively 57.16 km and
96.00 km, indicating that pedodiversity had spatial dependence within
these distances. Therefore, protection zones with radius of 57.16 km and
buffer zones with radius of 96 km was designed. For both the northern
and southern protection zones, the percent area of population density
lower than 1 person/km(2) (35.27% for the north and 51.71% for the
south) was much higher than the average value (27.91%) of Taihang
Mountain region. Furthermore, the percent area of farmland (43.72% for
the north and 40.48% for the south) were higher than the average value
(35.92%). This demonstrated that human activity, especially farming, was
a key consideration in the protection of pedodiversity in the study
region. The results of the study constitute a significant contribution
to the theory of pedodiversity protection and soil resources management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Despite its fundamental role for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling,
rhizodeposition remains ‘the hidden half of the hidden half’: it is
highly dynamic and rhizodeposits are rapidly incorporated into
microorganisms, soil organic matter, and decomposed to CO2. Therefore,
rhizodeposition is rarely quantified and remains the most uncertain part
of the soil C cycle and of C fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. This
review synthesizes and generalizes the literature on C inputs by
rhizodeposition under crops and grasslands (281 data sets). The
allocation dynamics of assimilated C (after C-13-CO2 or C-14-CO2
labeling of plants) were quantified within shoots, shoot respiration,
roots, net rhizodeposition (i.e., C remaining in soil for longer
periods), root-derived CO2, and microorganisms. Partitioning of C pools
and fluxes were used to extrapolate below-ground C inputs via
rhizodeposition to ecosystem level. Allocation from shoots to roots
reaches a maximum within the first day after C assimilation. Annual
crops retained more C (45% of assimilated C-13 or C-14) in shoots than
grasses (34%), mainly perennials, and allocated 1.5 times less C
belowground. For crops, belowground C allocation was maximal during the
first 1-2 months of growth and decreased very fast thereafter. For
grasses, it peaked after 2-4 months and remained very high within the
second year causing much longer allocation periods. Despite higher
belowground C allocation by grasses (33%) than crops (21%), its
distribution between various belowground pools remains very similar.
Hence, the total C allocated belowground depends on the plant species,
but its further fate is species independent. This review demonstrates
that C partitioning can be used in various approaches, e.g., root
sampling, CO2 flux measurements, to assess rhizodeposits’ pools and
fluxes at pot, plot, field and ecosystem scale and so, to close the most
uncertain gap of the terrestrial C cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Food security and agriculture productivity assessments in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) require a better understanding of how climate and other
drivers influence regional crop yields. In this paper, our objective was
to identify the climate signal in the realized yields of maize, sorghum,
and groundnut in SSA. We explored the relation between crop yields and
scale-compatible climate data for the 1962-2014 period using Random
Forest, a diagnostic machine learning technique. We found that improved
agricultural technology and country fixed effects are three times more
important than climate variables for explaining changes in crop yields
in SSA. We also found that increasing temperatures reduced yields for
all three crops in the temperature range observed in SSA, while
precipitation increased yields up to a level roughly matching crop
evapotranspiration. Crop yields exhibited both linear and nonlinear
responses to temperature and precipitation, respectively. For maize,
technology steadily increased yields by about 1% (13 kg/ha) per year
while increasing temperatures decreased yields by 0.8% (10 kg/ha) per
degrees C. This study demonstrates that although we should expect
increases in future crop yields due to improving technology, the
potential yields could be progressively reduced due to warmer and drier
climates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil texture is an independent and innate soil property and other
dynamic soil properties such as electrical conductivity (EC), organic
carbon (OC) content and cation exchange capacity (CEC) are mostly
dependent on it. An attempt was made to develop a model for numerically
simulating soil texture and also to construct relationships of the
developed model with other soil properties. Hypothetical data of
particle size distribution and our data were used to justify and
validate the newly defined indices. Scatter diagrams showed good
association between the indices and hypothetical data of soil separates.
Moreover, similar trends were observed between the line charts of USDA
soil textural class codes and the indices. Strong correlations (r =
0.78-0.96) were found between the indices and soil separates (sand, silt
and clay) for our data. However, the indices demonstrated moderate
correlations (r = -0.34 to -0.55) with EC and OC of the soils. Strong
nonlinear relationships were found between CEC and the three indices
(R-2 = 0.699, R-2 = 0.732 and R-2 = 0.672 (all P &amp;lt; 0.001). Furthermore,
the variability of EC, OC and CEC within a single USDA textural class
and customised textural index groups were described using the developed
model. The developed indices showed excellent fitness for simulation of
soil texture and demonstrated an extended applicability in terms of
their relationships with soil properties related to soil texture, which
will help in constructing digital soil maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In rainfed crop production, root zone plant-available water holding
capacity (RZ-PAWHC) of the soil has a large influence on crop growth and
the yield response to management inputs such as improved seeds and
fertilisers. However, data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA). This study produced the first spatially explicit, coherent
and complete maps of the rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We
compiled georeferenced data from 28,000 soil profiles from SSA, which
were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to produce
soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, we developed
and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to
evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and wilting point, the
soil fine earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize,
the soil rootability (relative to threshold values) and rootable depth.
Maps of these secondary soil properties were derived using the primary
soil property maps as input for the evaluation rules and the results
were aggregated over the rootable depth to obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC,
with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). The mean RZ-PAWHC for SSA is 74 mm
and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson correlation
between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable
depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity.
The total soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by
one third (over 10,500 km(3)) due to soil conditions restricting root
zone depth. Of these, 4800 km(3) are due to limited depth of aeration,
which is the factor most severely limiting in terms of extent (km2), and
2500 km(3) due to sodicity which is most severely limiting in terms of
degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock reduces the rootable soil
volume by 2500 km(3), aluminium toxicity by 600 km(3), porosity by 120
km(3) and alkalinity by 20 km(3). The accuracy of the map of rootable
depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to
absent data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the
accuracy of the primary soil property maps. The methodological framework
is robust and has been operationalised such that the maps can easily be
updated as additional data become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Simple and ordinary kriging assume a constant mean and variance of the
soil variable of interest. This assumption is often implausible because
the mean and/or variance are linked to terrain attributes, parent
material or other soil forming factors. In kriging with external drift
(KED) non-stationarity in the mean is accounted for by modelling it as a
linear combination of covariates. In this study, we applied an extension
of KED that also accounts for non-stationary variance. Similar to the
mean, the variance is modelled as a linear combination of covariates.
The set of covariates for the mean may differ from the set for the
variance. The best combinations of covariates for the mean and variance
are selected using Akaike’s information criterion. Model parameters of
the selected model are then estimated by differential evolution using
the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) in the objective function. The
methodology was tested in a small area of the Hunter Valley, NSW
Australia, where samples from a fine grid with gamma K measurements were
treated as measurements of the variable of interest. Terrain attributes
were used as covariates. Both a non-stationary variance and a stationary
variance model were calibrated. The mean squared prediction errors of
the two models were somewhat comparable. However, the uncertainty about
the predictions was much better quantified by the non-stationary
variance model, as indicated by the mean and median of the standardized
squared prediction error and by accuracy plots. We conclude that the non
-stationary variance model is more flexible and better suited for
uncertainty quantification of a mapped soil property. However, parameter
estimation of the non -stationary variance model requires more attention
due to possible singularity of the covariance matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Conservation agriculture through the use of crop residue retention and
no-tillage (NT) has been widely practiced to improve agricultural soil
quality, such as to increase soil organic carbon (C) content and the
microbial population size. However, there has been no quantitative
analysis on the effect of conservation agriculture, particularly in
relation to crop residue retention, on soil microbial biomass C (C-mic)
and nitrogen (N-mic), and the microbial quotient (qMIC,
C-mic-to-organicC ratio), which are frequently used as indicators of
soil health under different agricultural practices. The objective of
this study was to evaluate the influence of conservation agriculture
practices on soil C-mic, N-mic and qMIC on a global scale using
meta-analysis based on data from 96 recent publications. Relative to
conventional tillage (CT) without residue retention, NT without residue
retention (NTRO) increased C-mic by 33% (P &amp;lt; 0.05), while NT with
residue retention (NTR) increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) C-mic, N-mic and qMIC by
25, 64, and 57%, respectively. Greater C-mic and N-mic were found in the
NT than in the CT treatment, regardless of the soil condition (e.g.,
soil pH and texture), experimental duration, and climate (e.g., mean
annual temperature and precipitation). Particularly, NTR was a promising
conservation agriculture practice to increase C-mic and N-mic in global
farmlands, and NTRO can be an alternate strategy for loam soils in the
subhumid (600-1000 mm mean annual precipitation) region, or under
long-term (&amp;gt; 20 yr) conservation agriculture practices. We conclude that
NTR should be an important strategy that could be used to increase C-mic
and N-mic contents and improve soil quality in global farmlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Soil texture (relative proportions of soil particles of varied sizes) is
a fundamental soil physical property affecting almost all other soil
physical properties and processes of agricultural, environmental and
engineering importance. However, characterization of particle sizes in
the laboratory presents a range of challenges in terms of the time,
labor, difficulty and/or cost involved with the analysis. Continuous
wavelet transform (CWT) has been used in characterizing scale-specific
variations in spatial or temporal domain as well as in image analysis.
The objective of this study was to develop a CWT-based computer vision
algorithm to characterize soil particle sizes from digital images
captured with a microscope. A cheap portable microscope with 5 MP camera
and maximum magnification of 200 x was used to develop an image
acquisition system. Three images of air-dried, ground (2 mm) soil
samples were captured in laboratory conditions for each soil sample (56&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;67 = 123) collected from two agricultural fields (Field26 and Field86)
with highly variable soils. Triplicate in-situ images were also
collected from 67 locations from Field86 after scrapping off surface
residues. The color images were transferred to grey-scale images and the
CWT was performed along the 20 equally-spaced rows and columns. The
total area under the average global wavelet spectrum represented the
total variation in any image. Two fractions of particle sizes; ‘coarse’
(diameter between 2.0 mm and 0.05 mm) and ‘fine’ (diameter &amp;lt; 0.05 mm),
respectively, representing sand and sum of silt and clay were calculated
based on the area under the curve and compared with lab-measured
particle sizes using the hydrometer method. The lab-measured coarse- and
fine-fractions showed strong agreement with the predicted (from image)
fractions. The regression relationship showed the prediction capability
of 87% and 88% for coarse (RMSE 44.7 g kg(-1)) and fine (RMSE 44.7 g
kg(-1)) fractions, respectively for Field26 samples. A similar
prediction was obtained (88% with RMSE 40.2 g kg(-1) for coarse and 88%
with RMSE 40.3 g kg(-1) for fine) for Field86 samples. The efficiency of
the wavelet algorithm shows promise in determining the particle sizes
from an image and the portable nature of the image acquisition system
results in a good proximal soil sensor. In contrast to the laboratory
images, a weak prediction (48% for coarse and 56% for fine) was observed
for the images taken in-situ mainly due to the quality of the images as
they were affected by various field conditions; this requires further
research.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The availability of combine yield monitors since the early 1990’s means
that long time-series (10+ years) of yield data are now available in
many arable production systems. Despite this, yield data and maps are
still under exploited and under-valued by professionals in the
agricultural sector. These historical data need to be better considered
and analyzed because they are the only audited means by which growers
and practitioners can assess the spatio-temporal yield response within a
field. When done, time-series of yield maps are mostly processed by
classification-based algorithms to generate spatial and temporal yield
stability maps or to provide yield or management classes. This work
details an alternate segmentation-based methodology to first generate
and then characterize contiguous within-field yield zones from
historical yield data. It operates on the yield data rather than
interpolated yield maps. A seeded region growing algorithm is proposed
that enables both the specification of seeds and zone segmentation in a
multivariate (multi-temporal yield) attribute space. Novel metrics to
assess the yield zoning are proposed that are derived from textural
image analysis. The zoning algorithm and metrics were applied to two
fields with long time-series (6 + years) of yield data in combinable
crops. The two case studies showed that the proposed zone-based approach
was effective in delimitating relevant within-field yield zones. The
generated zones had differing temporal yield responses between
neighbouring zones that were of agronomic significant and interest to
the production systems. As this is a first attempt to apply a
segmentation algorithm to yield data, areas for future development
applications are also proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Epikarst the shallow, surficial part of a karstic massif - has a
significant influence on the spatio-temporal variability of recharge and
the hydrodynamic functioning of many karst aquifers. In the
Mediterranean morphoclimatic zone, the average thickness of a
well-developed epikarst is around ten metres, but the spatial patterns
of its degree of development are very heterogeneous due to the complex
interaction of a number of different factors such as lithology,
fracturing, weathering, soil and vegetation. In addition, direct field
observation is difficult because good outcropping conditions are
restricted to particular locations, some areas are not accessible and
the size of the study area is often too large for exhaustive field
surveys. Satellite-based remote sensing, however, provides a complete
coverage of an entire area with spectral resolutions that detect
variability in features that can define image textures related to the
development of the epikarst. This paper describes a quantitative
methodology for epikarst mapping using satellite images and field data.
The proposed method comprises an unsupervised classification to define
the spectral signature of each of three epikarst development categories
in a high-resolution satellite image followed by a supervised
classification of the terrain into one of the three categories on a low
spatial resolution scale. The training areas in the field are assigned
to the three categories by a panel of experts using the Delphi method.
Geophysical data are used for validation to overcome any bias that may
be introduced by the panel. The proposed methodology has been applied to
the Sierra de las Nieves karstic aquifer (Malaga, southern Spain). The
outcome is a map of estimated epikarst development that is an
approximation to reality and which can be improved as more experimental
data become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Multi-scale geospatial and absolute variation of surface and
near-surface soil physical and chemical properties can be mapped and
quantified by coupling digital soil mapping techniques with high
resolution remote sensing products. The goal of this research was to
advance data-driven digital soil mapping techniques by developing an
approach that can integrate multi-scale digital surface topography and
reflectance-derived remote sensing products, and characterize
multi-scale soil-landscape relations of Quaternary alluvial and eolian
deposits. The study area spanned the arid landscape encompassed by the
Barry M. Goldwater Range West (BMGRW), which is administered by the
Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, in southwestern Arizona, USA. An
iterative principal component analysis (iPCA) was implemented for LiDAR
elevation- and Landsat ETM + -derived soil predictors, termed
environmental covariates. Principal components that characterize &amp;gt; 95%
of covariate space variability were then integrated and classified using
an ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data) unsupervised technique. The
classified map was further segmented into polygons based on a region
growing algorithm, yielding multi scale maps of soil-landscape relations
that were compared with maps of soil landforms identified from aerial
photographs, satellite images and field observation. The approach
identified and mapped the spatial variability of soil-landscape
relationships in alluvial and eolian deposits and illustrated the
applicability of coupling covariate selection and integration by iPCA,
ISODATA classification of integrated data layers, and image segmentation
for effective spatial prediction of soil landscape characteristics. The
approach developed here is data driven, applicable for multi-scale
mapping, allows incorporation of a wide variety of covariates, and maps
spatially homogenous soil-landscape units that are necessary for
hydrologic models, land and ecosystem management decisions, and hazard
assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Interannual variability In the global carbon cycle is largely due to
variations in carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems, yet linkages
between climate variability and variability in the terrestrial carbon
cycle are not well understood at the global scale. Using a 30-year
satellite record of semi-monthly leaf area index (LAI), we show that
four modes of climate variability El Nino/Southern Oscillation, the
North Atlantic Oscillation, the Atlantic Meridional Mode, and the Indian
Ocean Dipole Mode strongly impact interannual vegetation growth
patterns, with 68% of the land surface impacted by at least one of these
teleconnection patterns, yet the spatial distribution of these impacts
is heterogeneous. Considering the patterns’ impacts by biome, none has
an exclusively positive or negative relationship with LAI. Our findings
imply that future changes in the frequency and/or magnitude of
teleconnection patterns will lead to diverse changes to the terrestrial
biosphere and the global carbon cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Automatic updating of land use/cover change (LUCC) databases using high
spatial resolution images (HSRI) is important for environmental
monitoring and policy making, especially for coastal areas that connect
the land and coast and that tend to change frequently. Many object-based
change detection methods are proposed, especially those combining
historical LUCC with HSRI. However, the scale parameter(s) segmenting
the serial temporal images, which directly determines the average object
size, is hard to choose without experts’ intervention. And the samples
transferred from historical LUCC also need experts’ intervention to
avoid insufficient or wrong samples. With respect to the scale
parameter(s) choosing, a Scale Self-Adapting Segmentation (SSAS)
approach based on the exponential sampling of a scale parameter and
location of the local maximum of a weighted local variance was proposed
to determine the scale selection problem when segmenting images
constrained by LUCC for detecting changes. With respect to the samples
transferring, Knowledge Transfer (KT), a classifier trained on
historical images with LUCC and applied in the classification of updated
images, was also proposed. Comparison experiments were conducted in a
coastal area of Zhujiang, China, using SPOT 5 images acquired in 2005
and 2010. The results reveal that (1) SSAS can segment images more
effectively without intervention of experts. (2) KT can also reach the
maximum accuracy of samples transfer without experts’ intervention.
Strategy SSAS + KT would be a good choice if the temporal historical
image and LUCC match, and the historical image and updated image are
obtained from the same resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We present and evaluate a quantitative method for delineation of
ecophysiographic regions throughout the entire terrestrial landmass. The
method uses the new pattern-based segmentation technique which attempts
to emulate the qualitative, weight-of-evidence approach to a delineation
of ecoregions in a computer code. An ecophysiographic region is
characterized by homogeneous physiography defined by the cohesiveness of
patterns of four variables: land cover, soils, landforms, and climatic
patterns. Homogeneous physiography is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for a region to be an ecoregion, thus machine delineation of
ecophysiographic regions is the first, important step toward global
ecoregionalization. In this paper, we focus on the first-order
approximation of the proposed method - delineation on the basis of the
patterns of the land cover alone. We justify this approximation by the
existence of significant spatial associations between various
physiographic variables. Resulting ecophysiographic regionalization
(ECOR) is shown to be more physiographically homogeneous than existing
global ecoregionalizations (Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEW)
and Bailey’s Ecoregions of the Continents (BEC)). The presented
quantitative method has an advantage of being transparent and objective.
It can be verified, easily updated, modified and customized for specific
applications. Each region in ECOR contains detailed, SQL-searchable
information about physiographic patterns within it. It also has a
computer-generated label. To give a sense of how ECOR compares to TEW
and, in the U.S., to EPA Level III ecoregions, we contrast these
different delineations using two specific sites as examples. We conclude
that ECOR yields regionalization somewhat similar to EPA level M
ecoregions, but for the entire world, and by automatic means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The objective of this review is to survey critically the results
obtained by the application of laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy
(LIFS) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to the evaluation
of the humification degree (HD) of soil organic matter (SOM) directly in
untreated, intact whole soils.A large number of soils of various origin
and nature, either native or under various cultivations, land use, and
management, at various depths, have been studied to evaluate the HD of
their SOM directly in intact whole samples. The LIFS spectra were
obtained by either a bench or a portable argon laser apparatus that
emits UV-VIS light of high power, whereas the LIBS spectra were obtained
using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm.The close correlations found
by comparing H-LIF values of whole soil samples with values of earlier
proposed humification indexes confirmed the applicability of LIFS to
assess the HD of SOM in whole soils. The high correlation found between
HDLIBS values and H-LIF values showed the promising potential of LIBS
for the evaluation HD of SOM.The LIFS technique shows to be a valuable
alternative to evaluate the HD of SOM by probing directly the whole
solid soil sample, thus avoiding the use of any previous chemical and/or
physical treatments or separation procedures of SOM from the mineral
soil matrix. The emerging application of LIBS to evaluate the HD of SOM
in whole soils appears promising and appealing due to its sensitivity,
selectivity, accuracy, and precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Water- and sediment-transfer models are commonly used to explain or
predict patterns in the landscape at scales different from those at
which observations are available. These patterns are often the result of
emergent properties that occur because processes of water and sediment
transfer are connected in different ways. Recent advances in
geomorphology suggest that it is important to consider, at a specific
spatio-temporal scale, the structural connectivity of system properties
that control processes, and the functional connectivity resulting from
the way those processes operate and evolve through time. We argue that a
more careful consideration of how structural and functional connectivity
are represented in models should lead to more robust models that are
appropriate for the scale of application and provide results that can be
upscaled. This approach is necessary because, notwithstanding the
significant advances in computer power in recent years, many geomorphic
models are still unable to represent the landscape in sufficient detail
to allow all connectivity to emerge. It is important to go beyond the
simple representation of structural connectivity elements and allow the
dynamics of processes to be represented, for example by using a
connectivity function. This commentary aims to show how a better
representation of connectivity in models can be achieved, by considering
the sorts of landscape features present, and whether these features can
be represented explicitly in the model spatial structure, or must be
represented implicitly at the subgrid scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Morphological analysis of landforms has traditionally relied on the
interpretation of imagery. Although imagery provides a natural view of
an area of interest (AOI) images are largely hindered by the
environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, the quality
of the image and, mainly, the lack of topographical information, which
is an essential factor for a correct understanding of the AOI’s
geomorphology.More recently digital surface models (DSMs) have been
incorporated into the analytical toolbox of geomorphologists. These are
usually high-resolution models derived from digital photogrammetric
processes or LiDAR data. However, these are restricted to relatively
small areas and are expensive or complex to acquire, which limits
widespread implementation.In this paper, we present the multi-scale
relief model (MSRM), which is a new algorithm for the visual
interpretation of landforms using DSMs. The significance of this new
method lies in its capacity to extract landform morphology from both
high- and low-resolution DSMs independently of the shape or scale of the
landform under study. This method thus provides important advantages
compared to previous approaches as it: (1) allows the use of worldwide
medium resolution models, such as SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X;
(2) offers an alternative to traditional photograph interpretation that
does not rely on the quality of the imagery employed nor on the
environmental conditions and time of its acquisition; and (3) can be
easily implemented for large areas using traditional GIS/RS software.The
algorithm is tested in the Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve, which is a very
large low-relief alluvial plain in northwest India where 10 000 km of
palaeoriver channels have been mapped using MSRM. The code, written in
Google Earth Engine’s implementation of JavaScript, is provided as
Supporting Information for its use in any other AOI without particular
technical knowledge or access to topographical data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Deep learning constitutes a recent, modem technique for image processing
and data analysis, with promising results and large potential. As deep
learning has been successfully applied in various domains, it has
recently entered also the domain of agriculture. In this paper, we
perform a survey of 40 research efforts that employ deep learning
techniques, applied to various agricultural and food production
challenges. We examine the particular agricultural problems under study,
the specific models and frameworks employed, the sources, nature and
pre-processing of data used, and the overall performance achieved
according to the metrics used at each work under study. Moreover, we
study comparisons of deep learning with other existing popular
techniques, in respect to differences in classification or regression
performance. Our findings indicate that deep learning provides high
accuracy, outperforming existing commonly used image processing
techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Agricultural land abandonment is a common land-use change, making the
accurate mapping of both location and timing when agricultural land
abandonment occurred important to understand its environmental and
social outcomes. However, it is challenging to distinguish agricultural
abandonment from transitional classes such as fallow land at high
spatial resolutions due to the complexity of change process. To date, no
robust approach exists to detect when agricultural land abandonment
occurred based on 30-m Landsat images. Our goal here was to develop a
new approach to detect the extent and the exact timing of agricultural
land abandonment using spatial and temporal segments derived from
Landsat time series. We tested our approach for one Landsat footprint in
the Caucasus, covering parts of Russia and Georgia, where agricultural
land abandonment is widespread. First, we generated agricultural land
image objects from multi-date Landsat imagery using a multi resolution
segmentation approach. Second, we estimated the probability for each
object that agricultural land was used each year based on Landsat
temporal-spectral metrics and a random forest model. Third, we applied
temporal segmentation of the resulting agricultural land probability
time series to identify change classes and detect when abandonment
occurred. We found that our approach was able to accurately separate
agricultural abandonment from active agricultural lands, fallow land,
and re-cultivation. Our spatial and temporal segmentation approach
captured the changes at the object level well (overall mapping accuracy
= 97 +/- 1%), and performed substantially better than pixel-level change
detection (overall accuracy = 82 +/- 3%). We found strong spatial and
temporal variations in agricultural land abandonment rates in our study
area, likely a consequence of regional wars after the collapse of the
Soviet Union. In summary, the combination of spatial and temporal
segmentation approaches of time-series is a robust method to track
agricultural land abandonment and may be relevant for other land-use
changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Satellite rainfall products have been available for many years (since
‘90) with an increasing spatial/temporal resolution and accuracy. Their
global scale coverage and near real-time products perfectly fit the need
of an early warning landslide system. Notwithstanding these
characteristics, the number of studies employing satellite rainfall
estimates for predicting landslide events is quite limited.In this
study, we propose a procedure that allows us to evaluate the capability
of different rainfall products to forecast the spatial -temporal
occurrence of rainfall -induced landslides using rainfall thresholds.
Specifically, the assessment is carried out in terms of skill scores,
and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The procedure is
applied to ground observations and four different satellite rainfall
estimates: 1) the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi -satellite
Precipitation Analysis, TMPA, real time product (3642-RT), 2) the
SM2RASC product obtained from the application of SM2RAIN algorithm to
the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) derived satellite soil moisture (SM)
data, 3) the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information
using Artificial Neural Network (PERSIANN), and 4) the Climate
Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Technique (CMORPH). As case study, we
consider the Italian territory for which a catalogue listing 1414
rainfall induced landslides in the period 2008-2014 is available.Results
show that satellite products underestimate rainfall with respect to
ground observations. However, by adjusting the rainfall thresholds,
satellite products are able to identify landslide occurrence, even
though with less accuracy than ground-based rainfall observations. Among
the four satellite rainfall products, CMORPH and SM2RASC are performing
the best, even though differences are small. This result is to be
attributed to the high spatial/temporal resolution of CMORPH, and the
good accuracy of SM2RSC. Overall, we believe that satellite rainfall
estimates might be an important additional data source for developing
continental or global landslide warning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
In rainfed crop production, root zone plant-available water holding
capacity (RZ-PAWHC) of the soil has a large influence on crop growth and
the yield response to management inputs such as improved seeds and
fertilisers. However, data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA). This study produced the first spatially explicit, coherent
and complete maps of the rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We
compiled georeferenced data from 28,000 soil profiles from SSA, which
were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to produce
soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, we developed
and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to
evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and wilting point, the
soil fine earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize,
the soil rootability (relative to threshold values) and rootable depth.
Maps of these secondary soil properties were derived using the primary
soil property maps as input for the evaluation rules and the results
were aggregated over the rootable depth to obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC,
with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). The mean RZ-PAWHC for SSA is 74 mm
and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson correlation
between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable
depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity.
The total soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by
one third (over 10,500 km(3)) due to soil conditions restricting root
zone depth. Of these, 4800 km(3) are due to limited depth of aeration,
which is the factor most severely limiting in terms of extent (km2), and
2500 km(3) due to sodicity which is most severely limiting in terms of
degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock reduces the rootable soil
volume by 2500 km(3), aluminium toxicity by 600 km(3), porosity by 120
km(3) and alkalinity by 20 km(3). The accuracy of the map of rootable
depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to
absent data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the
accuracy of the primary soil property maps. The methodological framework
is robust and has been operationalised such that the maps can easily be
updated as additional data become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Simple and ordinary kriging assume a constant mean and variance of the
soil variable of interest. This assumption is often implausible because
the mean and/or variance are linked to terrain attributes, parent
material or other soil forming factors. In kriging with external drift
(KED) non-stationarity in the mean is accounted for by modelling it as a
linear combination of covariates. In this study, we applied an extension
of KED that also accounts for non-stationary variance. Similar to the
mean, the variance is modelled as a linear combination of covariates.
The set of covariates for the mean may differ from the set for the
variance. The best combinations of covariates for the mean and variance
are selected using Akaike’s information criterion. Model parameters of
the selected model are then estimated by differential evolution using
the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) in the objective function. The
methodology was tested in a small area of the Hunter Valley, NSW
Australia, where samples from a fine grid with gamma K measurements were
treated as measurements of the variable of interest. Terrain attributes
were used as covariates. Both a non-stationary variance and a stationary
variance model were calibrated. The mean squared prediction errors of
the two models were somewhat comparable. However, the uncertainty about
the predictions was much better quantified by the non-stationary
variance model, as indicated by the mean and median of the standardized
squared prediction error and by accuracy plots. We conclude that the non
-stationary variance model is more flexible and better suited for
uncertainty quantification of a mapped soil property. However, parameter
estimation of the non -stationary variance model requires more attention
due to possible singularity of the covariance matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
China has an ever-increasing thirst for milk, with a predicted 3.2-fold
increase in demand by 2050 compared to the production level in 2010.
What are the environmental implications of meeting this demand, and what
is the preferred pathway? We addressed these questions by using a nexus
approach, to examine the interdependencies of increasing milk
consumption in China by 2050 and its global impacts, under different
scenarios of domestic milk production and importation. Meeting China’s
milk demand in a business as usual scenario will increase global
dairy-related (China and the leading milk exporting regions) greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions by 35% (from 565 to 764Tg CO2eq) and land use for
dairy feed production by 32% (from 84 to 111 million ha) compared to
2010, while reactive nitrogen losses from the dairy sector will increase
by 48% (from 3.6 to 5.4Tg nitrogen). Producing all additional milk in
China with current technology will greatly increase animal feed import;
from 1.9 to 8.5Tg for concentrates and from 1.0 to 6.2Tg for forage
(alfalfa). In addition, it will increase domestic dairy related GHG
emissions by 2.2 times compared to 2010 levels. Importing the extra milk
will transfer the environmental burden from China to milk exporting
countries; current dairy exporting countries may be unable to produce
all additional milk due to physical limitations or environmental
preferences/legislation. For example, the farmland area for cattle-feed
production in New Zealand would have to increase by more than 57% (1.3
million ha) and that in Europe by more than 39% (15 million ha), while
GHG emissions and nitrogen losses would increase roughly proportionally
with the increase of farmland in both regions. We propose that a more
sustainable dairy future will rely on high milk demanding regions (such
as China) improving their domestic milk and feed production efficiencies
up to the level of leading milk producing countries. This will decrease
the global dairy related GHG emissions and land use by 12% (90Tg CO2eq
reduction) and 30% (34 million ha land reduction) compared to the
business as usual scenario, respectively. However, this still represents
an increase in total GHG emissions of 19% whereas land use will decrease
by 8% when compared with 2010 levels, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
It has long been realized that the conservation of soil capital and
ecosystem services are of paramount importance, resulting in a growing
case for a change in attitude and policymaking in respect of soils.
Current UK and EU approaches are risk-based and focused on measures to
manage and remediate the adverse impact of current policies and
practices directed at maximizing productivity and profit, rather than
one of resource conservation. Increasing soil loss and degradation is
evidence that current policy is not working and a new approach is
needed. In the UK there is governmental ambition to progress towards
natural capital-led land use policies but, in the absence of a framework
to determine the relative condition of the soil resource, the delivery
of sustainable soil conservation policies will continue to be inhibited.
Common Standards Monitoring (CSM) is an established monitoring and
management framework (based on ecosystem structure, function and
process) and has been effectively deployed for almost two decades by the
UK Government for the monitoring and reporting of key biological and
earth science natural capital and ecosystem services from field’ to
local, regional and national levels to the European Commission. It is
argued that a CSM for soils could be developed for the UK’s soil
resources as well as for those elsewhere, and would be able to deliver a
conservation rather than the current risk-based approach. It is capable
of accommodating the complexities and variation in soil types and
functions and potentially being practical and cost-effective in its
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
