## 1. Introduction
-----

The self-consistent field theory (SCFT) for many-chain systems is obtained by imposing a mean-field approximation to simplify the statistical field theories.
The statistical field theories can be constructed from the particle-based model by carrying out a particle-to-field transformation.

The general approach for a particle-to-field transformation is to invoke formal techniques related to Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, which have the effect of decoupling interactions among particles (or polymer segments) and replacing them with interactions between the particles and one or more auxiliary fields.
