<p>Abstract:
Appropriate agricultural water management (AWM) is crucial not only for alleviating water scarcity but also for food and nutrition security and healthy ecosystems. The multidimensional nature of AWM and inherently complex feedbacks between its components necessitate a systems approach. This paper proposes six dimensions of AWM and illustrates the importance of a systems approach using six separate, but linked, classical AWM topics. By emphasizing the whole picture of AWM and interactions among its subsystems at multiple levels, a systems approach offers the opportunity to holistically scrutinize the pros and cons of proposed AWM interventions beyond their direct effects at the locus that a single-dimensional approach foretells.</p>

<p>Abstract:
We develop a game theoretic model of the role of foresight in games involving users interacting over a public good. Previous research in this area has applied game theory to understand social dilemmas and inform policy initiatives. However, considerations of the “evolving structure” of natural resource games over time and agents’ planning horizon raises the complexity of game analysis substantially and has often been overlooked. We analyze a simple model of an irrigation system shared by two users and consider how players will act under different levels of foresight. Without foresight into game changes over time, players are blind to the fact that they are in a game of chicken. We model agents with foresight by interconnecting games across time and show how this creates opportunities for “strategic loss” early on, allowing players with foresight to reduce total costs. High future costs can thus be avoided with foresight if the rising costs of inaction are made apparent. We co
 nsider the effect of discounting and differences between players to provide policy recommendations regarding incentives for foresight.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Accurate estimation of terrestrial evapotranspiration (E) is critical to understand the world’s energy and water cycles. MOD16 is the core algorithm of the widely used global E data set (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS] E product). However, it exhibits considerable uncertainties in some regions. Based on the data from 175 flux towers, we identified the key parameters of the MOD16 algorithm using the Sobol’ sensitivity analysis method across biomes. The output of the MOD16 algorithm was sensitive to eight parameters. Among them, beta, which is treated as a constant (0.2 kPa) across biomes in the original MOD16 algorithm, was identified as the parameter to which the algorithm was most sensitive. We used the differential-evolution Markov chain method to obtain the proper posterior distributions for each key parameter across a range of biomes. The values of the key parameters for the different biomes were accurately estimated by differential-evolution Mar
 kov chain in comparison with data from the flux towers. We then evaluated the performances of the original MOD16 and the optimized MOD16 and compared them at multiple spatial scales (i.e., site, catchment, and global). We obtained relatively consistent and more reliable E simulations using the optimized MOD16 at all three scales. In the future, more attention should be paid to uncertainties in the algorithm’s structure and its parameterizations of soil moisture constraint, canopy resistance, and energy partitioning.</p>

<p>Abstract:
The ability of soil microorganisms to uphold a variety of ecosystem services is of increasing interest, but our understanding of the linkage between cropland ecosystem services and the soil microbiome under long-term different fertilizer regimes is still limited. Here, we measured 15 response variables commonly used as indicators of cropland ecosystem services, and employed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing technology to determine microbiome taxonomic composition and functional composition in a sandy loam soil amended with organic and inorganic fertilizers for 28 years. Long-term application of fertilizers had overall positive effects on the variables that indicate soil C and nutrient status, organic material decomposition, nutrient transformation, and plant productivity, but the strength of these effects differed between organic and inorganic fertilization. In long term, organic fertilizers significantly increased the abundance of Sphingomonas and Acidobacteria as well as gen
 es involved in C and N metabolism and degradation of aromatic organic compounds. The observed differences in the indicators of overall biological activity, litter decomposition, nutrient transformation, cropland fertility and productivity were associated with changes in taxonomic composition and functional composition of the soil microbiome. Network analysis revealed that soil organic C, total N, L-leucine aminopeptidase, phosphatase, microbial biomass C and N, and the multifunctionality index showed strong positive associations with Acidobacterium, Lysobacter and Nitrososphaera. These microbes are implicated in the decomposition of organic material, soil C and N transformation, and plant growth promotion. The present study deepens our understanding of the relationship between the soil microbiome and agro-ecosystem functioning, and provides support for the use of organic fertilization strategy to enhance multiple ecosystem services in croplands.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Severe constraints on grasslands productivity, ecosystem functions, goods and services are expected to result from projected warming and drought scenarios under climate change. Negative effects on vegetation can be mediated via soil fertility and water holding capacity, though specific mechanisms are fairly complex to generalise. In field drought experiments, it can be difficult to disentangle a drought effect per se from potential confounding effects related to vegetation or soil type, both varying along with climate. Furthermore, there is the need to distinguish the long-term responses of vegetation and soil to gradual climate shift from responses to extreme and stochastic climatic events. Here we address these limitations by means of a factorial experiment using a single dominant grassland species (the perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L.) grown as a phytometer on two soils types with contrasted physicochemical characteristics, placed at two elevation sites along a climati
 c gradient, and exposed to early or late-season drought during the plant growing season.Warmer site conditions and reduced precipitation along the elevational gradient affected biogeochemistry and plant productivity more than the drought treatments alone, despite the similar magnitude in volumetric soil moisture reduction. Soil type, as defined here by its organic matter content (SOM), modulated the drought response in relation to local site climatic conditions and, through changes in microbial biomass and activity, determined the seasonal above and belowground productivity of L. perenne. More specifically, our combined uni-and multivariate analyses demonstrate that microbes in a loamy soil with low SOM are strongly responsive to change in climate, as indicated by a simultaneous increase in their C,N,P pools at high elevation with cooler temperatures and wetter soils. Contrastingly, microbes in a clay-loam soil with high SOM are mainly sensitive to temperature, as indicated 
 by a strong increase in microbial biomass under warmer tempe!
 ratures at low elevation and a concomitant increase in C:N, C:P and N:P ratios. High SOM promoted a better annual yield of the phytometer grass under warmer climate and the effect of drought on productivity was transient. In contrast, low SOM reduced cumulative yield under warmer conditions and root production strongly decreased, enduring a lasting drought effect. Microbes in soils with high organic matter remained more active during warmer and drier conditions, ensuring soil fertility and stimulating a higher overall plant nutrient availability and productivity.Our study highlights the important role of soil type for grassland responses to both stochastic climatic extremes and long-term climate change. Management practices enhancing SOM accumulation via organic residue incorporation seem a promising way to mitigate the effects of increased temperature and drought on plants and soil microbes alike promoting thereby a sustainable ecosystem functioning.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Soil microorganisms are key players of the nitrogen cycle and relevant for soil development. While the community structure of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms during initial soil development is already well investigated, knowledge about the patterns during long-term ecosystem development is limited. In this study, nitrogen functional genes of ammonia-oxidizers (amoA), nitrate-reducers (narG), and chitin-degraders (chiA) were determined via quantitative PCR and the functional community composition of archaeal ammonia-oxidizers was analyzed via clone libraries and DNA sequencing (amoA) in soil depth profiles along the 120,000-year Franz Josef chronosequence (New Zealand). The results show that absolute nitrogen functional gene abundances change significantly during long-term soil development. In organic layers, narG and chiA gene abundances were highest in young to intermediate-aged soils and then decreased following progressive and retrogressive development of the vegetation. W
 hile relative archaeal amoA gene abundance (proportional to total cell counts) decreased in the oldest phosphorus-limited topsoils, relative narG and chiA gene abundances remained constant. In subsoils, archaeal amoA and narG gene abundances also decreased with ecosystem retrogression that coincided with the increasing content of iron and aluminum oxides as well as other clay-sized minerals. In contrast, subsoil chiA gene abundances were hardly affected by soil age. The analysis of the archaeal amoA community revealed a compositional shift during long-term ecosystem development. Our study provides evidence that the community structure of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms in top- and subsoils is significantly affected by long-term ecosystem development and suggests an important role of the mineral phase in subsoils.</p>

<p>Abstract:
The separation of geochemical anomalies from the sample data of unknown distribution population is a great challenge, as it is difficult to determine the correct model for the unknown population distribution. Gaussian mixture model is a linear combination of several Gaussians. By using enough number of Gaussians and by adjusting parameters, the model can generate very complex probability density, which can approximate almost any continuous probability. Therefore, the Gaussian mixture model can fit the sample data of unknown distribution population, and those data points that do not conform to the model are considered as anomalies. The method was used to separate multivariate anomalies from the geochemical survey data of 1:200,000 scale collected from the Baishan district, Jilin Province, China, and compared with one-class support vector machine. The programs running the two models took 18.67 and 32.14 s, respectively; the receiver operating characteristic curves of the two mo
 dels intersect each other in the ROC space; and area under the curves of the two models are 0.851 and 0.855 respectively. The “best” threshold determined by using the Youden index was used to separate geochemical anomalies. The anomalies separated from the modeling results of the two models occupy respectively 14.46% and 14.49% of the study area and contain respectively 83% and 70% of the known mineral deposits. Therefore, Gaussian mixture model is comparable to one-class support vector machine in geochemical anomaly detection. It can be used as a geochemical anomaly detector with high performance and data modeling efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Modeling geological boundaries is an important step in geological modeling workflows that aim to quantify the location, volume, and uncertainty of a resource. Several well established explicit and implicit techniques can be used to identify the limits of an ore zone; however, most techniques are unable to account for uncertainty in a straightforward manner, where uncertainty originates from the sparseness of sample data relative to the volume of the resource in question. An implicit technique that benefits from simplicity and has the capabilities to incorporate and account for uncertainty in boundary geometry is signed distance function (SDF) modeling. Sample data that is in the form of line segments from drill holes presents challenges for interpolators such as kriging and radial basis functions. Utilizing linear regression as an interpolator several advantages to the problem are realized. The particular variant of regression that is used is moving least squares (MIS) that p
 ermits the exact integration of line data from drill holes and human interpretations without the need for discretization or numerical integration approaches. Integrating line data is critical for including explicit interpretations into implicit boundary models because geologic interpretations commonly involve polygons digitized on two dimensional sections through a field of drill holes.</p>

<p>Abstract:
We revisit a previously published approach, and present a new approach, to calculate the effect of osmotic stress on soil water availability assuming conservation of mass with respect to salt. The two (completely different) approaches allow the water capacity to be attenuated and a plant-sensitivity factor is introduced to enhance flexibility in modelling when new plant-response data arises. The results should be of value in evaluation of different cultivars of important crops being screened in the field for genetic tolerance to salinity in different soils.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Cotton cropping systems in Australia have poor nitrogen (N) use efficiency, largely due to over-application of N fertiliser. The N mineralisation from soil organic N reserves is often overlooked, or underestimated despite recent studies indicating that it may contribute the majority of N exported with the crop. Predicting N mineralisation is a major challenge for agricultural industries worldwide, as direct measurements are time-consuming and expensive, but there is considerable debate as to the most reliable methods for indirect estimation. Additionally, laboratory incubations assess potential (rather than actual) mineralisation, and may not be representative of N cycling rates in the field. We collected 177 samples from most major Australian cotton growing regions, and assessed their mineralisation potential using ex situ laboratory incubations, along with an assessment of potential indicators routinely measured in soil nutrient tests. Additionally, at three unfertilised si
 tes we conducted in situ assessment of mineralisation by quantifying soil N at the beginning of the growing season, and soil and crop N at the end of the season. We found that Australian cotton cropping soils had substantial mineralisation potential, and that soil total N and total carbon were correlated with mineralisation, and have potential to be used for prediction. Other potential indicators such as carbon dioxide production and ammonium and nitrate concentrations were not correlated with mineralisation. In parallel studies of ex situ and in situ mineralisation, we found ex situ laboratory incubations overestimated mineralisation by 1.7 times on average. We discuss findings in terms of management implications for Australian cotton farming systems.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Generating high resolution spatial information on the movement of sediment in response to soil erosion remains a major research challenge. In this paper we present a new tracing method that utilises LED (light emitting diode) light to induce fluorescence in a sand-sized tracer, which is then detected, using a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor in a commercial digital camera, at mm-resolution without the need for removal of soil material. First, we detail two complementary, but independent, methods for quantifying the concentration of tracer from images: particle counting and an intensity based method. We show that both methods can produce highly resolved estimates of particle concentrations under laboratory conditions. Secondly, we demonstrate the power of the method for collecting spatial information on soil redistribution by tillage, with mm precision, over an approximately 50m hillslope and vertically down the soil profile. Our work demonstrates the pote
 ntial to collect quantitative time-resolved data about soil movement without disturbing the soil surface which is being studied, and with it the possibility to parameterise or evaluate dynamic distributed soil erosion models or to undertake fundamental research focused on particle movement that has been impossible to conduct previously.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Climate change will most likely cause an increase in extreme precipitation and consequently an increase in soil erosion in many locations worldwide. In most cases, climate model output is used to assess the impact of climate change on soil erosion; however, there is little knowledge of the implications of bias correction methods and climate model ensembles on projected soil erosion rates. Using a soil erosion model, we evaluated the implications of three bias correction methods (delta change, quantile mapping and scaled distribution mapping) and climate model selection on regional soil erosion projections in two contrasting Mediterranean catchments. Depending on the bias correction method, soil erosion is projected to decrease or increase. Scaled distribution mapping best projects the changes in extreme precipitation. While an increase in extreme precipitation does not always result in increased soil loss, it is an important soil erosion indicator. We suggest first establishi
 ng the deviation of the bias-corrected climate signal with respect to the raw climate signal, in particular for extreme precipitation. Furthermore, individual climate models may project opposite changes with respect to the ensemble average; hence climate model ensembles are essential in soil erosion impact assessments to account for climate model uncertainty. We conclude that the impact of climate change on soil erosion can only accurately be assessed with a bias correction method that best reproduces the projected climate change signal, in combination with a representative ensemble of climate models</p>

<p>Abstract:
Excessive soil erosion and deposition is recognised as a significant land degradation issue. Quantifying soil erosion and deposition is a non-trivial task. One of these methods has been the mathematical modelling of soil erosion and deposition patterns and the processes that drive them. Here we examine the capability of a landscape evolution model to predict both soil erosion rate and pattern of erosion and deposition. This numerical model (SIBERIA) uses a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to represent the landscape and calculates erosion and deposition at each grid point in the DEM. To assess field soil redistribution rates (SRR) and patterns the distribution of the environmental tracer Cs-137 has been analysed. Net hill slope SRR predicted by SIBERIA (a soil loss rate of 1.7 to 4.3tha(-1)yr(-1)) were found to be in good agreement with Cs-137 based estimates (2.1 - 3.4tha(-1)yr(-1)) providing confidence in the predictive ability of the model at the hillslope scale. However some 
 differences in predicted erosion/deposition patterns were noted due to historical changes in landscape form (i.e. the addition of a contour bank) and possible causes discussed, as is the finding that soil erosion rates are an order of magnitude higher than likely soil production rates. The finding that SIBERIA can approximate independently quantified erosion and deposition patterns and rates is encouraging, providing confidence in the employment of DEM based models to quantify hillslope erosion rates and demonstrating the potential to upscale for the prediction of whole catchment erosion and deposition. The findings of this study suggest that LEMs can be a reliable alternative to complex and time consuming methods such as that using environmental tracers for the determination of erosion rates. The model and approach demonstrates a new approach to assessing soil erosion that can be employed elsewhere</p>

<p>Abstract:
A confluence of scientific and technological developments in geospatial data have made it possible to para-meterise the components of the soil water balance equation in space and time at spatial and temporal resolutions useful for agriculture. In this work, we present results on the development of an approach that takes advantage of this opportunity to predict soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 90 m on a daily time step at multiple depths in the profile.Three types of water balance model were examined: (i) single layer model with saturated flow (ii) multi-layer model with saturated flow and (iii) multi-layer model with unsaturated flow. Five layers were considered: 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm, which coincide with the layers of the Soil Landscape Grid of Australia which is available at similar to 90 m spatial resolution. Pedotransfer functions were used to predict the bucket size for each soil layer. Precipitation and evapotranspiration are estimated by gridde
 d SILO precipitation data (5 km, 1 day) and the MODIS 16 ET product (1 km, 8 day), respectively. Soil moisture predictions were tested against four publicly and privately owned soil moisture networks.The multi-layer model incorporating unsaturated flow performed the best in terms of predicting soil moisture for the whole profile (0-1 m) with a median correlation coefficient (r) of just over 0.7 across all sites. When classifying the sites according to the land use; cropping sites showed better median correlation (similar to 0.8) than grazing sites (similar to 0.7). However, grazing sites seem to have more consistent results for all the layers. To understand the relative importance of the water balance model predictions as compared to other environmental properties, a Random Forest model was fitted to a suite of variables e.g. soil order, month, temperature and etc., that vary in space, time or both space and time. For the analysis, only calibrated soil moisture network sites
  (OzNet) were considered. Soil moisture which was derived fr!
 om unsaturated soil water balance model was the 9th most important variable. To assess the quality of the predictive model, leave-one-out-site cross validation (LOOSCV) was performed and across all sites the prediction quality was reasonable (Concordance = 0.66, Accuracy = 0.06 cm 3 cm(-3)). These results highlight the potential of this approach and since it is based on readily available data it is scalable to large spatial domains.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Plant available water capacity (AWC) refers to the maximum amount of water that a soil can store and provide to plant roots. Spatial predictions of AWC through digital soil mapping at high resolution and national extent provide relevant information for upscaling ecological and hydrological models, and assessment of the provision of ecosystem services like water quantity and quality regulation, carbon sequestration, and provision of food and raw materials. However, the spatial predictions of AWC are prone to errors and uncertainties. Moreover, this digital soil mapping process requires using pedotransfer functions (PTFs) due to the lack of sufficient georeferenced measurements of the upper (i.e., soil moisture at field capacity, theta(Fc).) and lower (i.e., soil moisture at permanent wilting point, theta(pwp).) limits of soil moisture contents defining AWC. This adds an additional source of uncertainty to the final estimates of AWC. The objectives of this study were: 1) to pre
 dict AWC for mainland France following the GlobalSoilMap (GSM) project specifications on depth intervals and uncertainty, and 2) to quantify the uncertainty of AWC accounting for uncertainty of the soil input variables and the PTFs’ coefficients. We first predicted the soil input properties by GSM layer (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100, 100-200 cm), and then applied PTFs for estimating theta(FC) theta(PWP), and volumetric AWC (cm(3) cm(-3)). The volume of coarse elements by GSM layer was subtracted before aggregating AWC to estimated soil depth for a maximum of 2 m. The uncertainty of AWC was quantified by first-order Taylor analysis. Independent evaluation indicated that clay had the lowest R-2 (clay R-2 = 0.27, silt R-2 = 0.43 and sand R-2 = 0.46) and RMSE (clay RMSE = 128 g kg(-1), silt RMSE = 139 g kg(-1) and sand RMSE = 172 g kg(-1)) from the three particle size fractions. However, the model for coarse elements had the worst predictive performance (R-2 = 0.14 and RMSE =
  21%) among all AWC input variables. The performance of the !
 GSM predictions for theta(FC) and theta(PWP) had a R-2 of 0.21 and 0.29. When the PTFs were applied to the spatial predictions of sand and clay, the RMSE for theta(FC) and theta(PWP) had a relative increase of 25% and 36% respectively compared to when they were applied to measured horizon data. Across the majority of mainland France, the main sources of uncertainty of elementary AWC were coarse elements and soil texture, but the contribution of uncertainty of PTFs’ coefficients increased in areas dominated by very sandy and clayey textures. An advantage of the produced maps of theta(FC),theta(PWP) and AWC is that the end users can incorporate associated uncertainties into ecological and agricultural modelling, and decision-making processes involved in soil and water planning.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Soil thickness (ST) is a crucial factor in earth surface modelling and soil storage capacity calculations (e.g., available water capacity and carbon stocks). However, the observed depths recorded in soil information systems for some profiles are often less than the actual ST (i.e., right censored data). The use of such data will negatively affect model and map accuracy, yet few studies have been done to resolve this issue or propose methods to correct for right censored data. Therefore, this work demonstrates how right censored data can be accounted for in the ST modelling of mainland France. We propose the use of Random Survival Forest (RSF) for ST probability mapping within a Digital Soil Mapping framework. Among 2109 sites of the French Soil Monitoring Network, 1089 observed STs were defined as being right censored. Using RSF, the probability of exceeding a given depth was modelled using freely available spatial data representing the main soil-forming factors. Subsequently
 , the models were extrapolated to the full spatial extent of mainland France. As examples, we produced maps showing the probability of exceeding the thickness of each GlobalSoilMap standard depth: 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 cm. In addition, a bootstrapping approach was used to assess the 90% confidence intervals. Our results showed that RSF was able to correct for right censored data entries occurring within a given dataset. RSF was more reliable for thin (0.3 m) and thick soils (1 to 2 m), as they performed better (overall accuracy from 0.793 to 0.989) than soils with a thickness between 0.3 and 1 m. This study provides a new approach for modelling right censored soil information. Moreover, RSF can produce probability maps at any depth less than the maximum depth of the calibration data, which is of great value for designing additional sampling campaigns and decision making in geotechnical engineering.</p>
