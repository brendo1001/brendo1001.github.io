# Utterson

*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. This lawyer is Mr. Gabriel John Utterson, a loyal friend of Jekyll's (and, soon enough, a loyal friend of yours, as well).

---

Utterson was built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and  [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), a vanilla Jekyll install. It was designed and developed by [@alidcastano](https://twitter.com/alidcastano), to provide a minimal and unassuming theme, focused on what matters: you and your content.

[See the theme in action](http://utterson.alidcastano.com/).

*A minimal home page.*

## Features: 

Utterson provides a fully-functional setup:

* **Home Page with according navigation** makes your site is easy to navigate.
* **Sliding email subscription form** lets you can build your audience in a an unobtrusive manner. 
* **Simple Contact Form** with [Formspree](http://www.formspree.io/), provides a way for your your readers easily reach you by email, without you having to reveal personal information. 
* **Scrolling navigation bar** for posts lets readers can easily go back to your home page. 
* **Fade-in footer** allows you to have one last call to action at the bottom of each post, without getting in the way of your content. 

Also, building off Poole's vanilla install:

* **A holistic Jekyll setup** (Layouts, config, [archive page](/archive), [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), example pages and posts.)
* **Easily scalable** text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS.
* **Mobile Friendly Design** so that your site can be accessed on any device.

## Getting Started 

**Make it yours in under 20 minutes.**

Three simple steps:

1. Edit the <code>_config.yml</code> and put your own information. 
2. Edit the markdown files in <code>_includes/content</code> and talk about yourself. 
3. Replace the images in <code>/img</code> directory with your own.

Optionally: 

* You can change default variables in <code>_sass/variables</code> (i.e. if to change nav link colors). 
* If you don't want to use Formspree for your subscription form, you can change that in <code>_includes/email-form.html</code>.
