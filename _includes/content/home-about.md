# About Utterson 

*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. This lawyer is Mr. Gabriel John Utterson, a loyal friend of Jekyll's and Hyde's (and, soon enough, a loyal friend of yours, as well).

Utterson is devoted to reason and common sense. He consistently seeks to preserve order and decorum, does not gossip, and guards his friendsâ€™ reputations as though they were his own. Because of this, the novel (and your personal blog) are viewed through his observant but unassuming perspective.

Summoned by Poole, Utterson's role is advise and help Jekyll. It does so by furnishing a fully-functional yet minimal blog focused on you and your writing.
