## Introduction

This course describes and provides many detailed examples of implementing Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) using `R`. The work adheres to Digital Soil Mapping theory, and presents a strong focus on how to apply it. DSM exercises are also included and cover procedures for handling and manipulating soil and spatial data in `R`. The course also introduces the basic concepts and practices for building spatial soil prediction functions, and then ultimately producing digital soil maps. 

The materials for this course follow closely with the materials found in the [Using R for Digital Soil Mapping](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319443256) book. Depending on what resources you have avaiable, you may either purchase the hardcopy or the electronic version, in entirety or selected chapters. Of course most public and university libraries will also have a copy of the book for loan.

In addition to what is covered in that book, this course provides addtional examples and easier navigation around the different content too. Importantly these pages will be updated with new materials when the opportunity allows, such as when new methods become available or exisitng examples need modification. 

Topics covered in this course include:


* [Digital soil mapping: The fundamentals]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/introduction/)
* [R Literacy for digital soil mapping]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/r_literacy/)
* [An incomplete list of `R` packages useful to doing digital soil mapping]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/packages/) 
* [Getting spatial in R]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/r_gis/) 
* [Preparatory and exploratory analysis for digital soil mapping]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/dsm_prep/) 
* [Continuous soil attribute modelling and mapping]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/dsm_cont/) 
* [Categorical soil attribute modelling and mapping]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/dsm_cat/) 
* [Some methods for uncertainty quantification relevant for digital soil mapping]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/uncerts/)
* [Soil map disaggregation]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/disag/)
* [Combining continuous and categorical soil attribute modelling and mapping]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/twostep/)
* [Digital soil assessments]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/dsa/)

To explore and follow the exercises in most of the the pages above you will need to have the `R` package `ithir` installed. [Instructions for getting `ithir` installed are here]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/ithir/)

[`R` session]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/sesh_info/) information that describes the configurations used for running `R` code successfully in the various pages of this course. You may have different configurations, but if there are any errors in running the various code snippets in this course, it is useful to know what configurations were used intitally without getting errors.
