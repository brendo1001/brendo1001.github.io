      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In recent times we have bared witness to the advancement of the computer
and information technology ages. With such advances, there have come
vast amounts of data and tools in all fields of endeavor. This has
motivated numerous initiatives around the world to build spatial data
infrastructures aiming to facilitate the collection, maintenance,
dissemination and use of spatial information.</p>

<p>Soil science potentially contributes to the development of such generic
spatial data infrastructure through the ongoing creation of regional,
continental and worldwide soil databases, and which are now operational
for some uses e.g. land resource assessment and risk evaluation
(Lagacherie and McBratney 2006).</p>

<p>Unfortunately the existing soil databases are neither exhaustive enough
nor precise enough for promoting an extensive and credible use of the
soil information within the spatial data infrastructure that is being
developed worldwide. The main reason is that their present capacities
only allow the storage of data from conventional soil surveys which are
scarce and sporadically available (Lagacherie and McBratney 2006).</p>

<p>The main reason for this lack of soil spatial data is simply that
conventional soil survey methods are relatively slow and expensive.
Furthermore, we have also witnessed a global reduction in soil science
funding that started in the 1980s (Hartemink and McBratney 2008), which
has meant a significant scaling back in wide scale soil spatial data
collection and/or conventional soil surveying.</p>

<p>To face this situation, it is necessary for the current spatial soil
information systems to extend their functionality from the storage and
use of digitized (existing) soil maps, to the production of soil maps
<em>ab initio</em> (Lagacherie and McBratney 2006). This is precisely the aim
of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) which can be defined as:</p>

<p><em>The creation and population of spatial soil information systems by
numerical models inferring the spatial and temporal variations of soil
types and soil properties from soil observation and knowledge from
related environmental variables</em></p>

<p>The concepts and methodologies for DSM were formalized in an extensive
review by McBratney, Mendonca Santos, and Minasny (2003). In the
McBratney, Mendonca Santos, and Minasny (2003) paper, the <em>scorpan</em>
approach for predictive modelling (and mapping) of soil was introduced,
which in itself is rooted in earlier works by Jenny (1941) and Russian
soil scientist Dokuchaev. <em>scorpan</em> is a mnemonic for factors for
prediction of soil attributes: soil, climate, organisms, relief, parent
materials, age, and spatial position. The <em>scorpan</em> approach is
formulated by the equation:</p>

<p><em>S</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>s</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>o</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>n</em>) + <em>ϵ</em></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><em>S</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>Q</em>) + <em>ϵ</em></p>

<p>Long-handed, the equation states that the soil type or attribute at an
unvisited site (<em>S</em>) can be predicted from a numerical function or model
(<em>f</em>) given the factors just described plus the locally varying, spatial
dependent residuals (<em>ϵ</em>). The <em>f</em>(<em>Q</em>) part of the formulation is the
deterministic component or in other words, the empirical quantitative
function linking <em>S</em> to the <em>scorpan</em> factors (Lagacherie and McBratney
2006). The <em>scorpan</em> factors or environmental covariates come in the
form of spatially populated digitally available data, for instance from
digital elevation models and the indices derived from them which
include, slope, aspect, MRVBF etc. Landsat data, and other remote
sensing images, radiometric data, geological survey maps, legacy soil
maps and data, just to name a few. For the residuals (<em>ϵ</em>) part of the
formulation, we assume there to be some spatial structure. This is for a
number of reasons which include that the attributes used in the
deterministic component were inadequate, interactions between attributes
were not taken into account, or the form of <em>f()</em> was mis-specified.
Overall this general formulation is called the <em>scorpan</em>-kriging method,
where the kriging component is the process of defining the spatial trend
of the residuals (with variograms) and using kriging to estimate the
residuals at the non-visited sites.</p>

<p>Without getting into detail with regards to some of the statistical
nuances such as bias issues, which can be prevalent when using legacy
soil point data for DSM, the application of <em>scorpan</em>-kriging can only
be done in extents where there is available soil point data. The
challenge therefore is: what to do in situations where this type of data
is not available? In the context of the global soil mapping key soil
attributes, this is a problem, but can be overcome with the usage of
other sources of legacy soil data such as existing soil maps. It is even
more of a problem when this information is not available either.
However, in the context of global soil mapping, Minasny and McBratney
(2010) proposed a decision tree structure for actioning DSM on the basis
of the nature of available legacy soil data. This is summarized in
figure below. But bear in mind that this decision tree is not
constrained only to DSM at a global scale but at any mapping extent
where the user wishes to perform DSM given the availability of soil data
for their particular area.</p>

</figure>

<p>As can be seen from the above figure, once you have defined an area of
interest, and assembled a suite of environmental covariates for that
area, then determined the availability of the soil data there, you
follow the respective pathway. <em>scorpan</em>-kriging is performed
exclusively when there is only point data, but can be used also when
there is both point and map data available, e.g. Malone et al. (2014).</p>

<p>The work flow is quite different when there is only soil map information
available. Bear in mind that the quality of the soil map depends on the
scale and subsequently variation of soil cover; such that smaller scaled
maps e.g. 1:100 000 would be considered better and more detailed than
large scaled maps e.g. 1:500 000. The elemental basis for extracting
soil properties from legacy soil maps comes from the central and
distributional concepts of soil mapping units. For example, modal soil
profile data of soil classes can be used to quickly build soil property
maps. Where mapping units consist of more than one component, we can use
a spatially weighted means type method i.e. estimation of the soil
properties is based on the modal profile of the components and the
proportional area of the mapping unit each component covers, e.g.
Odgers, Libohova, and Thompson (2012). As a pre-processing step prior to
creating soil attribute maps, it may be necessary to harmonize soil
mapping units (in the case of adjacent soil maps) and/or perform some
type of disaggregation technique in order to retrieve the map unit
component information. Some approaches for doing so have been described
in Bui and Moran (2003). More recently soil map disaggregation has been
a target of DSM interest with a sound contribution from Odgers et al.
(2014) for extracting individual soil series or soil class information
from convolved soil map units by way of the DSMART algorithm. The DSMART
algorithm can best be explained as a data mining with repeated
re-sampling algorithm. Furthering the DSMART algorithm, Odgers,
McBratney, and Minasny (2015) then introduced the PROPR algorithm which
takes probability outputs from DSMART together with modal soil profile
data of given soil classes, to estimate soil attribute quantities (with
estimates of uncertainty).</p>

<p>What is the process when there is no soil data available at all? This is
obviously quite a difficult situation to confront, but a real one at
that. The central concept that was discussed by Minasny and McBratney
(2010) for addressing these situations is based on the assumed homology
of soil forming factors between a reference area and the region of
interest for mapping. Malone, Jha, and Minasny (2016) provides a further
overview of the topic together with a real world application which
compared different extrapolating functions. Overall, the soil homologue
concept or Homosoil, relative to other areas of DSM research is still in
its development. But considering from a global perspective, the
sparseness of soil data and limited research funds for new soil survey,
application of the Homosoil approach or other analogues will become
increasingly important for the operational advancement of DSM.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-intention-behind-of-this-dsm-course">What is the intention behind of this DSM course?</h3>

<p>These pages cover some of the territory that is described in the figure
above, particularly the <em>scorpan</em>-kriging type approach of DSM; as this
is probably most commonly undertaken. Also covered is spatial
disagregation of polygonal maps. This is framed in the context of
updating digital soil maps and downscaling in terms of deriving soil
class or attribute information from aggregated soil mapping units.
Importantly there is a theme of implementation about these pages; a sort
of how-to-guide. So there are some examples of how to create digital
soil maps of both continuous and categorical target variable data, given
available points and a portfolio of available covariates. The procedural
detail is explained and implemented using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> computing language.
Subsequently, some effort is required to become literate in this
programming language, both for general purpose usage and for DSM and
other related soil studies.</p>

<p>The motivation of this course then shifts to operational concerns and
based around real case-studies. For example, the book looks at how we
might statistically validate a digital soil map. Another operational
study is that of digital soil assessment (Carre et al. 2007). Digital
soil assessment (DSA) is akin to the translation of digital soil maps
into decision making aids. These could be risk-based assessments, or
assessing threats to soil (erosion, decline of organic matter etc.), and
assessing soil functions. These type of assessments can not be easily
derived from a digital soil map alone, but require some form of
post-processing inference. This could be done with quantitative modeling
and or a deep mechanistic understanding of the assessment that needs to
be made. A natural candidate in this realm of DSM is land capability or
agricultural enterprise suitability. A case study of this type of DSA is
demonstrated in this course. Specific topics of this course include:</p>
