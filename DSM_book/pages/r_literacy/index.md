This section introduces how to construct a function. A function is at the heart of R and is akin to a set of instructions to run a particular task. Functions are incredibly powerful and the fact that one can create their own functions leaves open the door for some very creative thinking about how to solve a particular problem or to conduct a nuanced task. The example here is about how one would go about designing a soil sample down along a toposequence. The starting point could be the top of a hill, at the bottom of a hill or anywhere between. This seems pretty intuitive to do in your mind, but to code this in R or any language requires a bit of logical thought and creativity. These are important for learning R and for doing digital soil mapping things!
