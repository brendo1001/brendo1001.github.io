In the [course fundamentals]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/introduction/), some of the history and theoretical underpinnings of DSM was discussed. Now with a solid foundation in `R`, it is time to put this all into practice i.e. do DSM with `R`. In the [DSM preparation]({{ site.url }}/DSM_book/pages/dsm_prep/) pages you were introduced to common steps need to get data in a format ready for spatial modelling. The implementation of some of the most commonly used model functions used for digital soil mapping will be covered in this section of pages. A few general concepts around assessing model fitness and validation need some covering first, but if you already comfortable about these, then jump straight into the looking at and fitting models.
