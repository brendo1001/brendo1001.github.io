<p>Authors:
Wijayawardena, MAA; Megharaj, M; Naidu, R</p>

<p>Source:
<em>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</em>, 17 (4):1064-1072; APR 2017</p>

<p>Abstract:
Lead (Pb) is a highly studied contaminant with no known biological
function that causes harmful adverse effects on ecological and human
health. We tried to evaluate how protective the current soil regulatory
levels are for Pb towards safeguarding the ecological health. In order
to achieve this, our study evaluated the effect of soil texture and pH
on the toxicity and availability of lead to earthworms in soils varying
in soil properties.The earthworm Eisenia fetida was exposed to Pb in
three soils with different physico-chemical characteristics. Pb
solutions were homogenously mixed with soil to obtain concentrations
ranging from 0 to 10,000 mg/kg Pb dry soil. Avoidance behaviour, weight
loss and mortality were measured in this study to calculate the EC50 and
LC50 values.Weight loss and mortality in earthworms due to Pb toxicity
were in the following order: acidic &gt; neutral &gt; alkaline soil. The EC50
values resulting in 50% decrease in worm weight over control for Pb in
acidic, neutral and alkaline soils were 460, 3606 and 5753 mg/kg soil,
respectively. Thus, the acidic soil recorded an EC50 well below the soil
guideline value for Pb. Whereas, the LC50 values resulting in 50%
mortality in worms over control were 1161, 4648 and 7851 mg/kg,
respectively, for acidic, neutral and alkaline soils. The Pb
concentrations in earthworms ranged from 0.2 to 740 mg/kg wet weight.
Soils with low clay content and acidic to neutral pH values demonstrated
an increased Pb toxicity in earthworms compared to the soils with
alkaline pH.The worm weight loss is a more sensitive parameter than the
mortality. This study emphasizes that the soil regulatory levels for Pb
are not protective of worms in acidic soils. Therefore, care should be
taken when using the current regulatory limits to assess and predict the
safety of a contaminated site with acidic soils towards the ecological
health.</p>

<p>Authors:
Rashed, M; Rashed, EA</p>

<p>Source:
<em>COMPUTERS &amp; GEOSCIENCES</em>, 102 12-21; MAY 2017</p>

<p>Abstract:
Background noise in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data is a nagging
problem that degrades the quality of GPR images and increases their
ambiguity. There are several methods adopting different strategies to
remove background noise. In this study, we present the Double-Sided
Sliding-Paraboloid (DSSP) as a new background removal technique.
Experiments conducted on field GPR data show that the proposed DSSP
technique has several advantages over existing background removal
techniques. DSSP removes background noise more efficiently while
preserving first arrivals and other strong horizontal reflections.
Moreover, DSSP introduces no artifacts to GPR data and corrects data for
DC-shift and wow noise.</p>

<p>Authors:
Panagiotakis, C; Kokinou, E</p>

<p>Source:
<em>COMPUTERS &amp; GEOSCIENCES</em>, 102 22-33; MAY 2017</p>

<p>Abstract:
In this work, an unsupervised isocontour based segmentation method is
proposed, that is applied on the detection of topographic highs with
arbitrary basal shapes on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). A series of
isocontour based segmentation maps is computed for decreasing altitude
levels. During this process, the isocontours are gradually merged
providing a topological hierarchy of highs in an inclusion tree
structure. A novel formulation of a topographic high is given taking
into account the volume evolution of an isocontour that starts from the
top of a high and grows, as decreasing the altitude level of isocontour,
until a high of higher altitude is reached. This formulation yields to a
robust unsupervised algorithm that can be sequentially applied. to
automatically recognize and discriminate the topographic highs of a
region according to the inclusion tree without any constraint on basal
shapes. The proposed method is applied on real and synthetic DEMs, in
order to automatically detect the exact shape of complex topographic
highs and some geomorphological based features useful for high
annotations, yielding high performance results, even if the highs are
partially visible in the given DEM.</p>

<p>Source:
<em>JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS</em>, 66 (3):629-645; APR 2017</p>

<p>Abstract:
Dupuytren disease is a fibroproliferative disorder with unknown
aetiology that often progresses and eventually can cause permanent
contractures of the fingers affected. We provide a computationally
efficient Bayesian framework to discover potential risk factors and
investigate which fingers are jointly affected. Our Bayesian approach is
based on Gaussian copula graphical models, which provide a way to
discover the underlying conditional independence structure of variables
in multivariate data of mixed types. In particular, we combine the
semiparametric Gaussian copula with extended rank likelihood to analyse
multivariate data of mixed types with arbitrary marginal distributions.
For structural learning, we construct a computationally efficient search
algorithm by using a transdimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
based on a birth-death process. In addition, to make our statistical
method easily accessible to other researchers, we have implemented our
method in C++ and provide an interface with R software as an R package
BDgraph, which is freely available from
http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BDgraph.</p>

<p>Abstract:
International corporations in an increasingly globalized economy exert a
major influence on the planet’s land use and resources through their
product design and material sourcing decisions. Many companies use life
cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate their sustainability, yet
commonly-used LCA methodologies lack the spatial resolution and
predictive ecological information to reveal key impacts on climate,
water and biodiversity. We present advances for LCA that integrate
spatially explicit modelling of land change and ecosystem services in a
Land-Use Change Improved (LUCI)-LCA. Comparing increased demand for
bioplastics derived from two alternative feedstock-location scenarios
for maize and sugarcane, we find that the LUCI-LCA approach yields
results opposite to those of standard LCA for greenhouse gas emissions
and water consumption, and of different magnitudes for soil erosion and
biodiversity. This approach highlights the importance of including
information about where and how land-use change and related impacts will
occur in supply chain and innovation decisions.</p>

<p>Authors:
Holland, JE; Biswas, A; Huang, J; Triantafilis, J</p>

<em>CATENA</em>, 154 40-49; JUL 2017</p>

<p>Abstract:
Soil varies from location to location as a result of complex
combinations of soil forming factors and processes operating at
different scales and intensities. The scale-dependent variability in
soil properties causes challenges for the characterization and mapping
of soils. With the advent of technologies, proximal sensors such as
gamma radiometrics can characterize soil spatial variability and the
digital mapping of soil properties. In this study we aim to characterize
scale-dependent variability of proximal gamma radiometrics and its
complex relationship with soil properties at different scales using
wavelet transform and wavelet coherency. We measured gamma radio metrics
(gamma-ray potassium (K-40), uranium (U-238), thorium (Th-232) and Total
Count (gamma-TC)) using a hand-held device in the field every 25 m along
a 3.0 km transect. At each point we measured elevation (m) and land use
and collected soil samples to determine key soil properties (electrical
conductivity EC1:5, pH (CaCl2), soil organic carbon (SOC), cation
exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable potassium (exch. K), and Colwell
P). Wavelet spectra identified significant (P &lt; 0.05) variations at
different scales and locations for both gamma-ray and soil properties.
There were significant localized variations with changes in elevation
and land use also important. In most cases a ‘global’ Pearson
correlation between the gamma-ray and soil properties was not
significant. In contrast, wavelet coherency provided a more powerful
scale-and location-specific relationship between gamma-ray, elevation
and land use with selected soil properties. For example, a strong
correlation (18% of the area was significant) was detected between land
use and soil EC1:5 at all scales (&lt;100-800 m) in a low drainage
depression. This correlation was due to the localized mobilization of
salts and has implications for the identification of saline land. At
large spatial scales (&gt;800 m) there was significant positive
correlations between gamma-TC and SOC (36% by area). At medium scales
(similar to 400 m) there was significant and positive correlations
between K-40 and CEC (23% by area), but only along the first half of the
transect which was underlain with Bushy Creek Granodiorite. These
findings provide an improved understanding of the spatial variability of
gamma-ray-soil relationships. The approach used shows the scope and
significant potential to use wavelet analysis of gamma-soil property
relationships that are scale-specific and would be useful for digital
soil mapping. Moreover, scale-specific spatial information of soil
properties aids understanding of soil formation processes and it
illustrates an approach to improve future soil sampling strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Mountain soils play an essential role in ecosystem management.
Assessment of land potentials can provide detailed spatial information
particularly concerning nutrient availability. Spatial distributions of
topsoil carbon, nitrogen and available phosphorus in mountain regions
were identified using supervised learning methods, and a functional
landscape analysis was performed in order to determine the spatial soil
fertility pattern for the Soyang Lake watershed in South Korea. Specific
research aims were (1) to identify important predictors; (2) to develop
digital soil maps; (3) to assess land potentials using digital soil
maps.Soil profiles and samples were collected by conditioned Latin
Hypercube Sampling considering operational field constraints such as
accessibility and no-go areas contaminated by landmines as well as
budget limitations. Terrain parameters and different vegetation indices
were derived for the covariates. We compared a generalized additive
model (GAM) to random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR).
For the predictor selection, we used the recursive feature elimination
(RFE). A land potential assessment for soil nutrients was conducted
using trimmed k-mean cluster analysis.Results suggested that vegetation
indices have powerful abilities to predict soil nutrients. Using
selected predictors via RFE improved prediction results. RF showed the
best performance. Cluster analysis identified four land potential
classes: fertile, medium and low fertile with an additional class
dominated by high phosphorus and low carbon and nitrogen contents due to
human impact. This study provides an effective approach to map land
potentials for mountain ecosystem management.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Glacier and ice sheet retreat exposes freshly deglaciated terrain which
often contains small-scale fragile geomorphological features which could
provide insight into subglacial or submarginal processes. Subaerial
exposure results in potentially rapid landscape modification or even
disappearance of the minor-relief landforms as wind, weather, water and
vegetation impact on the newly exposed surface. Ongoing retreat of many
ice masses means there is a growing opportunity to obtain high
resolution geospatial data from glacier forelands to aid in the
understanding of recent subglacial and submarginal processes. Here we
used an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture close-range aerial
photography of the foreland of Isfallsglaciaren, a small polythermal
glacier situated in Swedish Lapland. An orthophoto and a digital
elevation model with similar to 2cm horizontal resolution were created
from this photography using structure from motion software. These
geospatial data was used to create a geomorphological map of the
foreland, documenting moraines, fans, channels and flutes. The
unprecedented resolution of the data enabled us to derive morphological
metrics (length, width and relief) of the smallest flutes, which is not
possible with other data products normally used for glacial landform
metrics mapping. The map and flute metrics compare well with previous
studies, highlighting the potential of this technique for rapidly
documenting glacier foreland geomorphology at an unprecedented scale and
resolution. The vast majority of flutes were found to have an associated
stoss-side boulder, with the remainder having a likely explanation for
boulder absence (burial or erosion). Furthermore, the size of this
boulder was found to strongly correlate with the width and relief of the
lee-side flute. This is consistent with the lee-side cavity infill model
of flute formation. Whether this model is applicable to all flutes, or
multiple mechanisms are required, awaits further study.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is essential
to agricultural water management. The present study developed two
artificial intelligence models for daily ET0 estimation only with
temperature data, including extreme learning machine (ELM) and
generalized regression neural network (GRNN) in 6 meteorological
stations of Sichuan basin, southwest China, and compared the proposed
ELM and GRNN with the corresponding temperature-based Hargreaves (HG)
model and its calibrated version considering FAO-56 Penman-Monteith ET0
as benchmark. Two data management scenarios were evaluated for
estimation of ET0: (1) the models were trained/calibrated and tested
using the local data of each station; and (2) the models were
trained/calibrated using the pooled data from all the stations and
tested in each station. In the first scenario, the results showed that
the temperature-based ELM model provided the better estimation than the
GRNN, HG and calibrated HG models, with average relative root mean
square error (RRMSE) of 0.198, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.267 mmid
and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) of 0.891, respectively. In the
second scenario, GRNN model provided the most accurate results among the
considered models, with average RRMSE of 0.194, MAE of 0.263 mm/d and NS
of 0.895, respectively. Both of the temperature-based GRNN and ELM
performed much better than the HG and calibrated HG models for the two
scenarios, and the temperature-based GRNN and ELM models are appropriate
alternatives for accurate estimation of ET0 for Sichuan basin of
southwest China, which is very helpful for farmers or irrigation system
operators to improve their irrigation scheduling.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Eddy covariance (EC) continues to provide invaluable insights into the
dynamics of Earth’s surface processes. However, despite its many
strengths, spatial replication of EC at the ecosystem scale is rare.
High equipment costs are likely to be partially responsible. This
contributes to the low sampling, and even lower replication, of
ecoregions in Africa, Oceania (excluding Australia) and South America.
The level of replication matters as it directly affects statistical
power. While the ergodicity of turbulence and temporal replication allow
an EC tower to provide statistically robust flux estimates for its
footprint, these principles do not extend to larger ecosystem scales.
Despite the challenge of spatially replicating EC, it is clearly of
interest to be able to use EC to provide statistically robust flux
estimates for larger areas. We ask: How much spatial replication of EC
is required for statistical confidence in our flux estimates of an
ecosystem? We provide the reader with tools to estimate the number of EC
towers needed to achieve a given statistical power. We show that for a
typical ecosystem, around four EC towers are needed to have 95%
statistical confidence that the annual flux of an ecosystem is nonzero.
Furthermore, if the true flux is small relative to instrument noise and
spatial variability, the number of towers needed can rise dramatically.
We discuss approaches for improving statistical power and describe one
solution: an inexpensive EC system that could help by making spatial
replication more affordable. However, we note that diverting limited
resources from other key measurements in order to allow spatial
replication may not be optimal, and a balance needs to be struck. While
individual EC towers are well suited to providing fluxes from the flux
footprint, we emphasize that spatial replication is essential for
statistically robust fluxes if a wider ecosystem is being studied.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Quantifying changes in stocks of C, N, P, and S in agricultural soils is
important not only for managing these soils sustainably as required to
feed a growing human population, but for C and N, they are also
important for understanding fluxes of greenhouse gases from the soil
environment. In a global meta-analysis, 102 studies were examined to
investigate changes in soil stocks of organic C, total N, total P, and
total S associated with long-term land-use changes. Conversion of native
vegetation to cropping resulted in substantial losses of C (-1.6 kg
m(-2), -43%), N (-0.15 kg m(-2), -42%), P (-0.029 kg m(-2), -27%), and S
(-0.015 kg m(-2), -33%). The subsequent conversion of conventional
cropping systems to no-till, organic agriculture, or organic amendment
systems subsequently increased stocks, but the magnitude of this
increase (average of +0.47 kg m(-2) for C and +0.051 kg m(-2) for N) was
small relative to the initial decrease. We also examined the conversion
of native vegetation to pasture, with changes in C (-11%), N (+4.1%),
and P (+25%) generally being modest relative to changes caused by
conversion to cropping. The C: N ratio remained relatively constant
irrespective of changes in land use, whilst in contrast, the C: S ratio
decreased by 21% in soils converted to cropping - this suggesting that
biochemical mineralization is of importance for S. The data presented
here will assist in the assessment of different agricultural production
systems on soil stocks of C, N, P, and S -this information assisting not
only in quantifying the effects of existing agricultural production on
these stocks, but also allowing for informed decision-making regarding
the potential effects of future land-use changes.</p>
