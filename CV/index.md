### Research Interests
-----

- My research focus is in using quantitative methods to precisely understand how soils function and change- spatially, and through time. 

- I research methods for comprehensive digital soil mapping aiming to characterize soil both in the lateral and vertical dimensions. 

- I research methods for quantifying (and validating) measures of uncertainty for these comprehensive soil information systems. 

-  I investigate innovative systems for soil measurement, which includes that associated with remote and proximal and soil sensing instrumentation. I have particular interest in infrared and x-ray spectroscopy.
