### Research Interests
-----

- My research focus is in using quantitative methods to precisely understand how soils function and change- spatially, and through time. 

- I research methods for comprehensive digital soil mapping aiming to characterize soil both in the lateral and vertical dimensions. 

- I contribute methodology for quantifying (and validating) measures of uncertainty for these comprehensive soil information systems. 

- Outputs of this sort of work are intended for feeding into environmental modeling and monitoring programs, where precise land management decision making is required at all manner of spatial scales. 

- The importance of these research fields have been recognized by successful funding grants from both the Australian Research Council and Australian Government Department of Agriculture.
