### Research Experience
-----

**Visiting Researcher**, 2014 - present
*University of California, Santa Barbara, Materials Research Laboratory*

- Field-theoretic simulations of polymeric materials.

**Lecturer**, 2012 - present
*Fudan University, Department of Macromolecular Science*

- Performed Monte Carlo simulations on the nucleation and growth process in thickening of monolayer PEO crystals in ultrathin films.

**Ph.D. Candidate**, 2004 - 2009
*Peking University, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering*

- Introduced the phase field simulation techniques to study morphological evolution of monolayer poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) crystals.

- Conducted experimental studies on the nucleation, growth, and thickening of monolayer PEO crystals in ultrathin films using real-time atomic force microsocpy (AFM).

**Undergraduate Student**, 2003 - 2004
*Nanjing University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering*

- Synthesized three amphiphilic ligands and their complexes with Cu^2+.

- Computed surface properties of supported catalysts using Gaussian 98.
