### Research Interests
-----

- My research focus is in using quantitative methods to precisely understand how soils function and change- spatially, and through time. 

- I research methods for comprehensive digital soil mapping aiming to characterize soil both in the lateral and vertical dimensions. 

- I research methods for quantifying (and validating) measures of uncertainty for these comprehensive soil information systems. 

-  I investigate innovative systems for soil measurement, which includes that associated with remote and proximal and soil sensing instrumentation. I have particular interest in infrared and x-ray spectroscopy. 

- The importance of these research interests have been recognized by successful funding grants from both the Australian Research Council and Australian Government Department of Agriculture.

### Teaching and Extension
-----

I have co-developed training materials and conducted training workshops that cover topics related to digital soil mapping and soil spectral inference.  

- 30 August - 3 September 2010, Ispra, Italy: The first DSM workshop at European Union Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy attended by 15 staff. We designed the curriculum which used our latest research findings, and the course was designed as an active learning using authentic problems. Funded by JRC-EU.

- 2 April 2012, Sydney. Digital soil mapping training, 1-day workshop prior to the 5th Global Workshop on Digital Soil Mapping.   

- 7-15 March 2013, Sydney. Digital soil mapping training for soil scientists from the Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (9 participants). Funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Indonesia.  

- 4-5 April 2013, Sydney. Soil Spectral Inference workshop, 26 participants including researchers and scientists from government agencies and PhD students from Australia and overseas.   

- 18-20 June 2013, Sydney: Digital soil mapping training for soil scientists from Australian State and Federal soil agencies, Australian Collaborative Land Evaluation Program (ACLEP).    

- 22-24 April 2014, Sydney. Digital Soil Mapping Training Workshop. 20 participants, researchers and scientists from government agencies and PhD students.   

- 26-28 May, 2014, Soil Spectral Inference workshop, 5 participants including technical officers from Tasmanian Govt and researchers from University of Tasmania. Funded by ARC Linkage project.
