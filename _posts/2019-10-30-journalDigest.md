Abstract:
Due to confounding factors such as crop residue and soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM) is usually estimated from soil samples in a laboratory or in the field at a local scale. In this study, laboratory and field data of crop residue, soil moisture, crop management practices, and SOM content were used in concert with multi-temporal MODIS images captured during bare soil periods over three years to construct spectral indices, which were then used as input variables to build a regional-scale SOM prediction model. Results showed that: (1) multi-temporal satellite images can be used to predict SOM content at a regional scale; (2) crop residue cover and time interval between snow melt, rainfall, and ploughing determined the optimal input variables for SOM prediction; (3) compared to a SOM model based on a single image, a multi-temporal model reduced the influence of soil moisture and improved both the stability and the accuracy of SOM prediction; (4) the best models generally
  used the ratio of MODIS Band 6 and Band 1 (R-61) as an input variable, as R-61 showed good correlation with SOM and less correlation with moisture; and (5) comparing different models in different years showed that models performed better in years with less crop residue. The study results can be used to improve the accuracy of quantitative estimates of the soil organic carbon pool and provide assistance in digital soil mapping.

Abstract:
Soil heterogeneity is a major contributor to the uncertainty in predicting the environmental fate of data-scare contaminants. For this paper, we focused on research designed to predict the soil environmental fate of the new munition compound, called 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) -a compound increasingly employed by the U.S. and international militaries in the next-generation, insensitive explosive formulations. Here, we employed multi-variate statistical correlation models to predict DNAN sorption among different soil "types" seeking to reduce the uncertainty common in all contaminant sorption models by using soil taxonomic designation as a calibrant. We collected composite soils classified under the Ultisols taxonomic Order in the U.S. National Resource Conservation Service soil classification system and quantified their properties via physical and chemical characterizations. Using multivariate statistical modeling modified for compositional data analysis (CoDa), we developed qu
 antitative analogies of the Ultisols by partitioning the characterization data up into four different compositions: Water-extracted, Mehlich-III (referring to the weak acid) extracted, particle-size distribution, and solid-phase carbon-nitrogen-sulfur compositions. DNAN sorption was measured in batch soil suspensions and distribution coefficients (K-D) were calculated using linear regression modeling. Prediction models testing the correlation of the DNAN K-D values to the centered logratio-transformed compositions were calculated using CoDa-modified multilinear regression. Results showed that DNAN sorption was only predictable by dissolved organic carbon, pH, and the exchangeable cations Ca and K within the water-extracted composition. Analogies for DNAN sorption were the most discriminating at the Suborder level because of the inherent ambiguity in the Hapludults class at the Great Group level.

Abstract:
A correct quantification of soil surface and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is crucial for the evaluation of important soil functions, including atmospheric C sequestration. At present, soil science lacks (i) a clear definition of soil depth, (ii) consented procedures for soil sampling, as well as (iii) adequate awareness concerning pitfalls and caveats associated with quantification of soil surface area and large-scale SOC stocks in mountainous, complex landscapes. Traditional SOC stock quantification in these landscapes often did not adequately address site-specific geomorphological conditions and thus yielded incorrect results due to combination of incompatible methods for soil depth assessment, soil profile or core sampling, and soil surface area calculation. In our paper, we suggest unequivocal definitions of soil depth, horizon thickness, and SOC density, which can be applied for soils in sloping as well as flat terrain. Moreover, we quantify and discuss potential SOC
  (and other soil nutrient) stock assessment errors in mountainous regions, using the German Alps as case study. We present a protocol to ensure an unbiased quantification of soil surface area, as well as SOC or nutrient element stocks in mountainous landscapes. Taking into account the considerable area of sloping terrain on the global scale, and particularly in mountainous countries (e.g. Switzerland, Austria, Andes Countries, Nepal, Japan), our publication will contribute to a more accurate quantification of soil stocks of SOC and important nutrients as well as area-based C fluxes (e.g. CO2 sequestration or release) or other surface-related biogeochemical fluxes.

Abstract:
The performance of digital soil mapping (DSM) model is highly reliant on the intensity and spatial distribution of the input soil data points. Increasing the number of soil data points (i.e. samples) improves the accuracy of the prediction, but it also raises the sampling effort, including the time, money and labor required for field and laboratory analysis. Thus, optimizing the production of DSMs requires maximizing accuracy while minimizing cost. In this study, we evaluated a range of strategies for DSM of a farm field using high spatial resolution ancillary environmental data (e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle-UAV imagery) and compared sampling efforts of soil data generated from standard laboratory analysis (SLA) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) at equivalent costs. We produced DSMs of a number of soil properties including sand, silt, clay, pH, salinity, organic matter, and total nitrogen. We employed Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) to generate a range of sampl
 ing efforts from the full SLA (n = 62) and MIRS (n = 308) datasets and contrasted the DSM outcomes modeled using kriging with external drift (KED). We found that the DSM outputs were most effective, in terms of accuracy and cost, at 50-60% of the full sampling effort. Although MIRS predictions of soil properties introduced a sizable amount of error, DSMs produced using the MIRS dataset were more accurate as compared to the outcomes of SLA datasets at equivalent sampling efforts. The prediction accuracy for DSMs varied across the soil properties with R-2 ranging from 0.82 (for sand) to 0.45 (for total nitrogen) at the optimum sampling effort. The outcomes of the study highlight that spatially optimized sampling efforts and the use of the MIRS technique substantially improve the cost efficiency and accuracy of kriging-based DSM models for predicting a range of field scale soil properties.

Abstract:
The spatiotemporal variability of soil water content (SWC) at the remote sensing scale requires dense monitoring for calibration and validation. Here, we present an overview of the Texas Soil Observation Network (TxSON), an intensively monitored area in the semiarid rangelands of the central Texas Hill Country. TxSON is a dense network consisting of 40 in situ locations nested at 36, 9, and 3 km within the Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid and serves as a Core Calibration and Validation Site for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The 4-yr dataset consists of hourly SWC measured at 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm. The SWC data are upscaled using arithmetic, Voronoi, and inverse distance weighting for 36-, (2) 9-, and (5) 3-km grid cells. We present the site selection, environmental characteristics, network design, quality assurance (QA), upscaling algorithms, and data structure. Ancillary data include bulk density, particle size, and carbon content for each site and depth. We also
  provide automated QA for each location and scripts to use our binary flagging in upscaling methods. To summarize, the 36-km grid cell has a mean bulk density of 1.34 +/- 0.18 g cm(-3) and a loam textural class. The in situ SWC has a root mean square error of 0.029 m(3) m(-3) against gravimetric data from 14 field campaigns. TxSON continues to add new locations with additional dense networks planned in other ecotones of the Edwards Plateau. The time series data along with scripts to import, plot, and upscaled SWC are available at https:// doi .org/10.18738/T8/JJ16CF.

Abstract:
The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Survey (NASS) collects and publishes crop growth status and soil moisture conditions in major U.S. agricultural regions. The operationally produced weekly reports are based on survey information. The surveys are based on visual assessments and-in the case of soil moisture-report soil moisture levels in one of four categories (Very Short, Short, Adequate, and Surplus). In this study, we show that these reports have remarkable correspondence with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 Soil Moisture (L4SM) product. This consistency allows for combining the two different types of data to produce a value-added assessment, which enables cropland soil moisture mapping and state-level statistics. Moreover, it enables daily assessment rather than weekly. In this study classification thresholds are derived for L4SM by mapping cumulative distribution functions of L4
 SM surface and root zone SM to the categorical NASS SM conditions. The results show that, year over year, the SMAP cumulative SM distributions are consistent with the NASS SM conditions and, furthermore, that the temporal evolution of the SMAP-derived thresholds is consistent with the seasonal crop growth cycles from year to year. The results signify that the SMAP SM retrievals are relatable to SM estimation conducted in agricultural crop land by land managers and farmers, which underlines the general applicability of the SMAP data.
