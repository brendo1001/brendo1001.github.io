title: Why I love Jekyll
---

The Co-founder of Github, [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo), created [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) back in 2008. His motivation was to do away with the complexity of other blogging platforms. He wanted to create  work flow that would allow him to, as he put it, [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).

What does it mean to blog like a hacker? It means that you don't have to use WordPress, or any other complex blogging platform built for masses. You don't have to deal with CMS, WYSIWYG editors, or PHP plug-ins. Just your favorite text editor and a few git commands. By eliminating layers of unnecessary complexity, Jekyll brings you closer to your writing.

It was with a similar purpose that I created this theme: to create a minimal yet unique theme that focused on you and you're writing, above all. I hope you find it useful.
