We present the first global systematic map of the effectiveness of nature‐based solutions (NbS) for addressing the impacts of climate change and hydrometeorological hazards on people. We found that most studies on NbS interventions in natural or semi‐natural ecosystems reported reduced climate impacts and that, overall, more synergies than trade‐offs were reported between addressing climate impacts and broader ecological, social and climate change mitigation outcomes. However, to strengthen the evidence base and support the upscaling of NbS, future studies should compare the cost‐effectiveness of NbS with engineered alternatives and consider social and ecological outcomes. More NbS research is also needed in the Global South.

Nitrogen enrichment is known to increase plant productivity, while also decreasing species richness and acidifying soils. We show that productivity could have been 14.5% greater on average in monocultures if not for nitrogen‐induced soil acidification and about 28.5% greater on average in 16 species communities if not for nitrogen‐induced species losses in a 20 year planted richness by nitrogen addition grassland plant experiment. Our results suggest that the positive effect of nutrient enrichment on productivity can diminish over time, especially because of soil acidification in low diversity communities and especially because of plant diversity loss in initially high diversity communities.
