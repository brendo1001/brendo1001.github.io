Abstract:
Chemical weathering in soils dissolves and alters minerals, mobilizes
metals, liberates nutrients to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and
may modulate Earth's climate over geologic time scales.
Climate-weathering relationships are often considered fundamental
controls on the evolution of Earth's surface and biogeochemical cycles.
However, surprisingly little consensus has emerged on if and how climate
controls chemical weathering, and models and data from published
literature often give contrasting correlations and predictions for how
weathering rates and climate variables such as temperature or moisture
are related. Here we combine insights gained from the different
approaches, methods, and theory of the soil science, biogeochemistry,
and geomorphology communities to tackle the fundamental question of how
rainfall influences soil chemical properties. We explore climate-driven
variations in weathering and soil development in young, postglacial
soils of New Zealand, measuring soil elemental geochemistry along a
large precipitation gradient (400-4700 mm/yr) across the Waitaki basin
on Te Waipounamu, the South Island. Our data show a strong climate
imprint on chemical weathering in these young soils. This climate
control is evidenced by rapid nonlinear changes along the gradient in
total and exchangeable cations in soils and in the increased movement
and redistribution of metals with rainfall. The nonlinear behavior
provides insight into why climate-weathering relationships may be
elusive in some landscapes. These weathering thresholds also have
significant implications for how climate may influence landscape
evolution and the release of rock-derived nutrients to ecosystems, as
landscapes that transition to wetter climates across this threshold may
weather and deplete rapidly.
