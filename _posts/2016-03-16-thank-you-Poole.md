title: Feeling thankful for Poole 
---

This theme is built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), a vanilla Jekyll install built by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo), who coincidently is also the creator of Bootstrap. In other words, Poole is a theme created to kick starts theme development, by a guy who obviously knows what he's doing.

I was happy to see my belief confirmed. Poole provided only the essentials of what any blog would need. Well, almost. I had to remove two things. I removed RSS feed (does anyone still use that anymore?) and replaced it with a <a href="#" id="trigger-form" class="tab-aside-link is-active">Newsletter Sign Up Form</a>. I also removed pagination (it's deprecated and a headache to deal with) and replaced it for an [archive page](/archives). 

Only other change, I reformatted where post dates are shown. Before they were in the home page and at the beginning of each post. But when people see dates everywhere, they treat that number as an expiration date for when your post would have been useful. 
So I removed them from everywhere except for the bottom of every posts. Good advice does not expire, so by extension your post shouldn't either (:

I'll also mention that, in terms of nomenclature, I'm a fan of Otto's *Dr. Jekyll and Hyde* naming scheme. I was delighted to see the character [Gabriel Utterson](http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/characters.html), who is the narrator and a loyal friend of Jekyll's, was not taken. But now, it is. 

All in all, thanks to Otto for the solid foundation. If you're considering designing your on Jekyll blog, be sure check out [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole). Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and download [Utterson](http://utterson.alidcastano.com/). (:
