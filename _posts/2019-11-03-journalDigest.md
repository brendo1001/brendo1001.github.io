Abstract:
Thousands of small wetland depression features (cypress domes) dot the low-relief karst of Big Cypress National Preserve (BICY) in South Florida, USA. We hypothesized that these wetland depressions are organized in a regular pattern, which is atypical of wetlandscapes elsewhere. Regular patterning implies the existence of coupled feedbacks operating at different spatial scales, with local wetland depression expansion (facilitation via karst dissolution) limited by competition among adjacent depressions for finite water resources (inhibition). We sought to test the hypothesis that wetlands in BICY exhibit regular patterning, and to quantify pattern properties to evaluate competing genesis mechanisms. We tested four predictions about landscape structure and geometry using high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging elevation data from six 2.25-km(2) domains across BICY. Specifically, we predicted (1) feature overdispersion resulting from competition between adjacent basins; (2)
  truncated wetland area distributions due to growth inhibition feedbacks; (3) periodicity in surface elevation indicating a characteristic pattern wavelength; and (4) elevation bimodality indicating distinct upland and wetland states. All four predictions were strongly supported. Depressions were significantly overdispersed and efficiently fill the landscape, generating hexagonal patterning. Wetland areas followed truncated power law scaling, indicating incremental constraints on basin expansion, in contrast to depression areas elsewhere. Variogram and radial spectrum analyses revealed clear periodicity (similar to 150- to 250-m wavelength) in surface elevations. Finally, surface elevations were consistently bimodal with elevation divergence of 10 to 40 cm. Regular patterning of wetland depressions across BICY is clear, implying long-term biogeomorphic control on landform structure in this karst landscape.

Abstract:
Functional diversity holds the promise of understanding ecosystems in ways unattainable by taxonomic diversity studies. Underlying this promise is the intuition that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But this promise also rests on several conceptual and methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions should be clearly addressed, notably for the sake of an effective comparison and integration across domains, and for assessing whether or not to use functional diversity approaches for developing ecological management strategies. The objective of this contribution is to identify and critically analyze the most salient of these assumptions. To this aim, we provide an epistemic roadmap that pinpoints these assumption
 s along a set of historical, conceptual, empirical, theoretical, and normative dimensions.

Abstract:
Traditional methods for determining soil water content at permanent wilting point (theta(PWP)) are time consuming. The objectives of this study are to develop a model for predicting theta(PWP) based on easily measured hygroscopic water content and to compare the performance of the proposed model with three previous models: the Aina & Periaswamy model (AP model), the van den Berg et al. model (vdB model) and the Seybold & Harms model (SH model), which estimate theta(PWP) from particle size distribution and/or organic matter (OM) content. By assuming that the dry end of the soil water retention curve could be described with the linear Campbell & Shiozawa model, a simple linear model, theta(PWP) = 3 theta(RH50), was developed to predict theta(PWP) using theta(RH50). The theta(RH50) of the soils ranged from 0.002 to 0.157 g g(-1) and the theta(PWP) ranged from 0.014 to 0.279 g g(-1). The validation results on 48 soils showed that the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolu
 te error (MAE) of the proposed model were 0.007 g g(-1) and 0.005 g g(-1), respectively. Model comparison showed that the prediction accuracy of four models for theta(PWP) was in the order of proposed model > AP model > SH model > vdB model. Thus, theta(RH50) is a viable predictor for theta(PWP), which eliminates the need for soil particle size distribution and OM content. HighlightsWater content at permanent wilting point (theta(PWP)) relates to hygroscopic water content. A model was developed to predict theta(PWP) using water content at relative humidity of 50%. The proposed model performed better than existing models.
