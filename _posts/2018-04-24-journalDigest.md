Abstract:
Understanding the spatial distribution and sources of soil heavy metals
(HMs) in a large city helps prevent and control soil pollution. This
study aimed to investigate the spatial patterns of soil HMs and identify
their main sources in a regional scale.A total of 110 topsoil samples
were collected from Tai'an City, China. Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn
concentrations in each soil sample were determined. Geostatistics,
geographic information system (GIS), and positive matrix factorization
(PMF) were used to explore the spatial distribution of seven soil HMs
and to reveal the main sources of soil HMs in Tai'an City,
respectively.Soil Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn generally showed slight pollution
levels in the study area. However, soil Hg and Cu contents reached
moderate to heavy pollution levels in some areas. Soil Hg content
increased from north to south across the city, and the highest Hg
concentration was detected in Ningyang County. Soil Cd, Cu, and Zn
distributions exhibited a similar pattern, and their contents increased
from west to east; the highest Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations were found
in Xintai County. The highest soil Ni concentration was obtained in the
northeast of Feicheng and Xintai counties. PMF analysis revealed the
following four potential sources of agricultural soil HMs in Tai'an
City: industrial and mining activities, agricultural activities,
residential living activities, and business activities. Soil Hg mainly
originated from residential living activities, which accounted for 75.3%
of the total source. The main sources of soil Ni were residential living
activities, agricultural activities, and industrial and mining
activities, which account for 38.2, 27.50, and 25.1% of the total
source, respectively. Soil Cu was mainly produced by agricultural
activities (36.6%), followed by residential living activities (29.8%)
and industrial and mining activities (25.8%).PMF combined with GIS could
be effectively applied to determine the main sources of HMs in
agricultural soils in a regional scale.
