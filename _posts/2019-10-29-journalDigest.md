Abstract:
This paper aims to provide alternative approaches for automatic classification of subsurface hydrocarbon-bearing regions from 2D seismic images driven by multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPs) (a kind of artificial neural network) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The first approach is based on a standard MLP whose features are controlled by Haralick's textural descriptors; the second one is developed with a multiple-layer CNN. Both techniques are studied to identify geologic "leads", instead of delineating other structures of the porous medium, such as salt bodies or seismic faults. The outcomes obtained from each approach are evaluated for a dataset of seismic images corresponding to the offshore SEAL Basin in Brazil's northeastern. Performance indicators (accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure and loss) are computed to verify training and validation of the network learning capabilities. It is shown that for both MLP and CNN configurations, good agreement is 
 achieved in blind testing qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract:
A spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for the upload and provision of soil-agricultural research data in Germany was developed and launched in 2017. The precondition for the new SDI were to be compliant with the European initiative for spatial information (INSPIRE), to consider FAIR data principles, to be interoperable with other disciplinary national and international SDIs and to support dataset registrations with digital object identifiers (DOI). To meet these requirements, the new SDI had to support both the INSPIRE and DataCite metadata standards. As there was no metadata standard available that supported both metadata schemes from different disciplines, it became necessary to merge these two existing standards.The objective of this paper is to describe the developmental steps of the newly created BonaRes metadata schema for geospatial soil-agricultural research data. First, we analyzed the INSPIRE and DataCite metadata schemas, identified and compared semantically equivale
 nt metadata elements, including properties and allowed content values, for potential mapping. In the next step, we specified the new metadata model, whose elements were derived from INSPIRE or DataCite under consideration of the previously developed mapping. Third, additional metadata elements were defined to directly describe the underlying data model.The advantages and disadvantages of the method that was applied to define the BonaRes metadata schema elements originating from INSPIRE and DataCite schemas are presented and discussed. By implementing the new metadata model, the SDIs can achieve cross-portal metadata interoperability with other INSPIRE-compliant SDIs. Furthermore, researchers who store their geospatial research data in SDIs to implement the BonaRes metadata schema can increase the visibility and findability of their research, as the data can be assigned a DOI, which is a prerequisite for data citations and data publications. The new metadata elements of the B
 onaRes metadata schema allows targeted dataset queries, e.g.!
 , soil pH values, yields or parameters, which were measured by a specific method, using the underlying data model, and improves the discovery and reusability of research data.
 
 ### The response of vegetation cover and dune activity to rainfall, drought and fire observed by multitemporal satellite imagery

Abstract:
The stable longitudinal dunes in the northern Simpson Desert, Australia, were observed in satellite imagery to become more active after vegetation cover was reduced by fire and drought. Subsequent rainfall events also resulted in significant vegetation regrowth and dune stabilization. These switches between more active and stable conditions have not been previously described in the largely vegetated dune fields of central Australia. The observations, made on 12 dune sites, relied on high spatial resolution satellite imagery to observe dune crest activity, and seasonal Landsat fractional cover imagery to observe vegetation cover changes. The non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) component of the fractional vegetation cover images revealed significant changes in hummock grass cover on the dunes between 1988 and 2018, with a positive relationship with the three-year cumulative rainfall, disrupted by two periods of patchy burning. Only those sites that had burnt became active, and 
 only after vegetation cover had remained low (NPV < 16%) during the 'Millennium Drought'. There is no threshold in vegetation cover, below which dune crests become active, but active dune features require four-years of low NPV cover (< 16%) to develop. The large rainfall event that ended the drought increased NPV cover, stabilizing the dunes. Similar hummock grass covered dunes are present across large areas of the arid zone, and are likely to respond in similar ways, given that fire and drought are common occurrences in Australia.

Abstract:
Cause-specific mortality forecasting is often based on predicting cause-specific death rates independently. Only a few methods have been suggested that incorporate dependence between causes. An attractive alternative is to model and forecast cause-specific death distributions, rather than mortality rates, as dependence between the causes can be incorporated directly. We follow this idea and propose two new models which extend the current research on mortality forecasting using death distributions. We find that adding age, time and cause-specific weights and decomposing both joint and individual variation between different causes of death increased the forecast accuracy of cancer deaths by using data for French and Dutch populations.

Abstract:
We tested one front-end data fusion method to combine visible near-infrared (vis-NIR) and portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectra for predicting different soil properties and investigated the contribution of different sensor data. A total of 197 soil samples were collected from 25 Alfisols and Mollisols in south-central Wisconsin, USA. Soils were analysed in the laboratory for clay, sand, silt content, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and pH. Air-dried soil samples were scanned with vis-NIR and PXRF spectrometers. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to each of the vis-NIR and PXRF spectra to extract the first 10 principal components (PCs), which were used in the Cubist model. Five types of input data were compared for constructing the models using a front-end data fusion approach, including: (a) 10 PCs from vis-NIR spectra, (b) 10 PCs from spectra of PXRF beam 1 (XRF40), (c) 10 PCs from spectra of PXRF beam 2 (XRF10), (d) concatenating 20 PCs from two PX
 RF spectra (XRF40 + 10), and (e) concatenating 30 PCs from two PXRF spectra and vis-NIR spectra (XRF40 + 10 + NIR). In addition, the performances of the preprocessing methods (four smoothing methods with or without background removal) of PXRF spectra were compared. Multiple linear regression was also used to predict soil properties directly from 11 PXRF-estimated elements. Our results suggest that smoothing should be applied to the PXRF spectra prior to developing predictive models. PXRF spectra and elemental data can predict soil texture with validation R-2 > 0.85, better than using solely vis-NIR spectra, and combining vis-NIR and PXRF spectra improved the prediction. Combining PXRF and vis-NIR can also predict TC and TN moderately well. Soil pH cannot be predicted from vis-NIR or PXRF spectra in this dataset due to its weak correlations with other soil properties and elements. It is concluded that PXRF spectra can be solely used to estimate soil texture, whereas combining

Different preprocessing algorithms were compared systematically for PXRF spectra. Spectral smoothing should be applied to the PXRF spectra prior to developing predictive models.

Abstract:
Irrigation is essential for maintaining food production in water-scarce regions. The irrigation need depends on the water content of the soil, which we measured with the novel technique of cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS). The potential of the CRNS technique for drip irrigation scheduling was explored in this study for the Picassent site near Valencia, Spain. To support the experimental evidence, the neutron transport simulation URANOS was used to simulate the effect of drip irrigation on the neutron counts. The overall soil water content (SWC) in the CRNS footprint was characterized with a root mean square error <0.03 cm(3)/cm(3), but the experimental dataset indicated methodological limitations to detect drip water input. Both experimental data and simulation results suggest that the large-area neutron response to drip irrigation is insignificant in our specific case using a standard CRNS probe. Because of the small area of irrigated patches and short irrigation time, the 
 limited SWC changes due to drip irrigation were not visible from the measured neutron intensity changes. Our study shows that CRNS modeling can be used to assess the suitability of the CRNS technique for certain applications. While the standard CRNS probe was not able to detect small-scale drip irrigation patterns, the method might be applicable for larger irrigated areas, in drier regions, and for longer and more intense irrigation periods. Since statistical noise is the main limitation of the CRNS measurement, the capability of the instrument could be improved in future studies by larger and more efficient neutron detectors.
