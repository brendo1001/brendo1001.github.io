Abstract:
Since the introduction of the cosmic-ray neutron method for soil
moisture estimation, numerous studies have been conducted to test and
advance the accuracy of the method. Almost 200 stationary neutron
detector systems have been installed worldwide, and roving systems have
also started to gain ground. The intensity of low-energy neutrons
produced by cosmic rays, measured above the ground surface, is sensitive
to soil moisture in the upper decimeters of the ground within a radius
of hectometers. The method has been proven suitable for estimating soil
moisture for a wide range of land covers and soil types and has been
used for hydrological modeling, data assimilation, and calibration and
validation of satellite products. The method is challenged by the effect
on neutron intensity of other hydrogen pools such as vegetation, canopy
interception, and snow. Identifying the signal of the different pools
can be used to improve the cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture method as
well as extend the application to, e.g., biomass and canopy interception
surveying. More fundamental research is required for advancement of the
method to include more energy ranges and consider multiple height
levels.


### From tailings to soil: long-term effects of amendments on progress and trajectory of soil formation and in situ remediation in bauxite residue

Abstract:
Bauxite residue is an alkaline, saline-sodic byproduct of the Bayer
process for alumina production. In situ remediation of bauxite residue
is a cost-effective management strategy that transforms the residue into
a soil-like medium; however, the effects of applied amendments on
trajectories and progress of soil formation over the medium-long term
are unclear. Here, we investigated how in situ remediation amendments
guided the progress and trajectories of soil formation in bauxite
residue over 20 years.Chemical and mineralogical properties of samples
from a field site in Corpus Christi, Texas, were analyzed to compare the
effects of three different amendments (sewage sludge, yard waste, and
topsoil) on progress and trajectories of soil formation in bauxite
residue. Bauxite residue was deposited ca. 40 years prior to sampling;
amendments were applied at varying frequencies for 20 years prior to
sampling.Sewage sludge was the most effective amendment for decreasing
pH, EC, and total alkalinity of bauxite residue and increasing plant
nutrients and exchangeable cations. Overall soil development is in an
early stage; however, incipient soil horizons were identified from
differences in chemical and mineralogical properties with depth.
Although amendment type influenced the progress of soil formation, it
did not appear to influence the overall trajectory of soil formation
processes. Soil derived from the bauxite residue parent material is
likely to progress from a spolic Technosol to a technic Cambisol and
finally either a Ferralsol or Luvisol depending on organic matter
dynamics.Long-term impacts of amendments were consistent with those
observed in previous short-term studies, with some outcomes improving
further over the long term (e.g., Na+ leaching) and were realized to a
depth enabling maintenance of a vegetation cover. These outcomes provide
strong support for the use of in situ remediation as an alternative to
soil capping that enables transformation of bauxite residue to a soil
capable of supporting a self-sustaining ecosystem.

Abstract:
Environmental pollution is a great concern worldwide. The soil
environment, an important compartment for global elemental cycling, has
received tremendous research focuses over the past 20 years. This study
investigated the current research activities in the field of
contaminated soil remediation and determined the trend of research
topics.We performed a quantitative bibliometric analysis based on
journal articles published within the past 20 years using the Science
Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index databases on the Web
of Science. To further analyze the publication performance and identify
the major soil contamination topics, we employed social network analysis
and S-curve predictions.Chemosphere and Journal of Hazardous Materials
were the most productive journals with a total of 433 and 431 articles
from 1996 to 2015 on contaminated soil remediation, respectively. China
had the largest amount of publications (n = 1518) and the Chinese
Academy of Science was the most prominent institution (n = 475). Keyword
analysis further identified the most studied soil pollutants, such as
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, crude oil, and heavy metals, in the
top five productive countries, including China, USA, Spain, India, and
Canada. Moreover, soil remediation technologies, including microbial
remediation, phytoremediation, and electrokinetic remediation, were the
major technologies receiving increasing interest in the results of the
prediction analysis.Our results identified the hotspots and developing
trends of contaminated soil remediation studies and provide guidance for
future research directions. However, transitions from the laboratory to
field implementations are still required. Bibliometric analysis,
combined with patent analysis, social network analysis, and S-curve
prediction, is a useful tool to provide a quantitative measurement of
research activities in the past and present, enabling a prediction on
the future study of soil remediation.

Abstract:
An advanced estimation model CARS-PLS (competitive adaptive reweighted
sampling-partial least squares) has been developed for feature
extraction and soil contamination analysis. However, this method works
well for a single mining area and has limited capacity in coping with
the variations from multiple sites. In this paper, we present an
improved estimation model, CARS-PLS-SVM, to cope with the nonlinear
problem in multiple sites with SVM (support vector machines).We selected
two study areas located in metal mining and coal mining areas of north
China. A total of 65 soil samples were collected. The heavy metal(loid)
concentrations (Cr and As) were determined by inductively coupled
plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic fluorescence spectrometry
(AFS), and the visible and near-infrared spectra of the soil samples
were measured with an ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices) field
spectrometer (350-2500 nm). Samples were divided into calibration set (n
= 41) and validation set (m = 24) according to heavy metal(loid)
concentration. After different pretreatment methods, the new features
extracted from CARS-PLS are used as the input to model the data further
with SVMs.The performance of CARS-PLS-SVM was investigated under seven
different pretreatment methods. Results showed that using combination of
Savitzky-Golay and standard normal transformation pretreatment method
achieved the best accuracy for Cr estimation (coefficient of
determination for prediction, R (p) (2) = 0.9705, root-mean-square error
for prediction, RMSEP = 5.0253, residual prediction deviation, RPD =
5.9001, ratio of prediction performance to interquartile range, RPIQ =
11.4043) and for As prediction (R (p) (2) = 0.9483; RMSEP = 1.2024; RPD
= 3.0689; RPIQ = 5.3643). Besides, CARS-PLS-SVM is better than partial
least squares (PLS) regression under the same pretreatment methods.
Compared with three current state-of-the-art models: wavelet transform
PLS (WT-PLS), synergy interval PLS (siPLS), and the CARS-PLS model,
CARS-PLS-SVM was found to be superior to the other methods for Cr
prediction (R (p) (2) = 0.9705; RMSEP = 5.0253; RPD = 5.9001; RPIQ =
11.4043) and As prediction (R (p) (2) = 0.9483; RMSEP = 1.2024; RPD =
3.0689; RPIQ = 11.5.3643).The results demonstrate that compared with
other linear models, the nonlinear model CARS-PLS-SVM has the highest
precision in soil heavy metal(loid) estimation modeling of multiple
mining areas by the use of proper spectral feature extraction from the
pretreated spectra.

Abstract:
Global-scale surface soil moisture products are currently available from multiple remote sensing platforms. Footprint-scale assessments of these products are generally restricted to limited number of densely-instrumented validation sites. However, by taking active and passive soil moisture products together with a third independent soil moisture estimates via land surface modeling, triple collocation (TC) can be applied to estimate the correlation metric of satellite soil moisture products (versus an unknown ground truth) over a quasi-global domain. Here, an assessment of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture retrievals via TC is presented. Considering the potential violation of TC error assumptions, the impact of active-passive and satellite-model error cross correlations on the TC-derived inter-comparison results is examined at in situ sites using quadruple collocation analysis. In addition, confidence intervals for the TC-estimated correlation metric are constructed from moving-block bootstrap sampling designed to preserve the temporal persistence of the original (unevenly-sampled) soil moisture time series. This study is the first to apply TC to obtain a robust global-scale cross-assessment of SMAP, SMOS and ASCAT soil moisture retrieval accuracy in terms of anomaly temporal correlation. Our results confirm the overall advantage of SMAP (with a global average anomaly correlation of 0.76) over SMOS
(0.66) and ASCAT (0.63) that has been established in several recent regional, ground-based studies. SMAP is also the best-performing product over the majority of applicable land pixels (52%), although SMOS and ASCAT each shows advantage in distinct geographic regions.

Abstract:
The availability of remote sensing images of various resolutions has enabled the incorporation of landscape structures in land-cover mapping.
Despite the effectiveness of landscape metrics in quantifying landscape structures, they are inadequate in characterizing three elements:
spatial neighborhoods, spatial dependencies, and semantic dependencies.
Moreover, methods for mining the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity (i.e., spatial variations in landscape structures) are still limited, particularly for applications in urban land-cover mapping. This study hence proposes a novel approach with the aims to (1) characterize landscape structures considering the above three elements;
(2) mine the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity; and (3) apply landscape-structure information as contexts to improve urban land-cover mapping. To achieve the first aim, landscape-structure features including pair-wise spatial relationships and neighborhood-based landscape metrics are defined. To accomplish the second aim, a clustering technique and a landscape infographic are used to cluster landscape structures and visualize landscape-structure types, respectively. Finally, a hierarchical classifier based on the feedforward multi-layer perceptron is developed for the third aim.
Experiments are conducted in a heterogeneous urban environment in Beijing, China. The results show that the proposed approach, which considers 34 landscape-structure features and 19 landscape-structure types, achieves a classification accuracy improvement of 6.43% compared with the approaches without considering landscape-structure information.
This study therefore demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating landscape-structure features and landscape-structure types in improving urban land-cover mapping.

Abstract:
Urban land-use mapping is a significant yet challenging task in the field of remote sensing. Although numerous classification methods have been developed for obtaining land-use information in urban areas, the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are insufficient to meet the requirements of real-world applications such as urban planning and land management. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), have achieved an astonishing level of performance in image classification. However, the traditional DCNN methods do not focus on multispectral remote sensing images with more than three channels, and they are limited by their training samples. In addition, these methods uniformly decompose large images into small processing units, which chop up the land-use patterns and produce land-use maps with obvious "blocks". In this study, a semi-transfer deep convolutional neural network (STDCNN) approach is proposed to overcome these weaknesses. The proposed STDCNN has three parts: one part involves a transferred DCNN with deep architecture; another part is designed to analyze multispectral images; and the final part fuses the first two parts into a classification layer. Moreover, a skeleton-based decomposing method using street block data is devised to maintain the integrity of the land-use patterns. In two case studies, the proposed method is used to generate urban land-use maps from a WorldView-3 image of a 143 km(2) area of Hong Kong and a WorldView-2 image of a 25 km(2) area of Shenzhen. The results show that the proposed STDCNN obtains an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.25% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.903 for Hong Kong land-use classification, and an OA of 80% and a Kappa of
0.780 for Shenzhen land-use classification. In addition, due to the proposed skeleton-based decomposition method, the proposed method can produce better land-use maps for real-world urban applications.

*REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT*, 210 113-143; JUN 1 2018 

Abstract:
NASA's Black Marble nighttime lights product suite (VNP46) is available at 500 m resolution since January 2012 with data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Platform (SNPP). The retrieval algorithm, developed and implemented for routine global processing at NASA's Land Science Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS), utilizes all high-quality, cloud-free, atmospheric-, terrain-, vegetation-, snow-, lunar-, and stray light-corrected radiances to estimate daily nighttime lights (NTL) and other intrinsic surface optical properties.
Key algorithm enhancements include: (1) lunar irradiance modeling to resolve non-linear changes in phase and libration; (2) vector radiative transfer and lunar bidirectional surface anisotropic reflectance modeling to correct for atmospheric and BRDF effects; (3) geometric-optical and canopy radiative transfer modeling to account for seasonal variations in NTL; and (4) temporal gap-filling to reduce persistent data gaps. Extensive benchmark tests at representative spatial and temporal scales were conducted on the VNP46 time series record to characterize the uncertainties stemming from upstream data sources. Initial validation results are presented together with example case studies illustrating the scientific utility of the products. This includes an evaluation of temporal patterns of NTL dynamics associated with urbanization, socioeconomic variability, cultural characteristics, and displaced populations affected by conflict. Current and planned activities under the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Human Planet Initiative are aimed at evaluating the products at different geographic locations and time periods representing the full range of retrieval conditions.

Abstract:
Delimitation of soil types within a farm field is key for site-specific
crop management. An alternative to this, is to develop pedometric
techniques that allow an efficient combination of soil survey
information and high-resolution terrain attribute data. The aim of this
study was to present and evaluate a pedometric technique to delimit
soil-specific zones at field scale by coupled Random forest, fuzzy
k-means clustering and spatial principal components algorithms
(RF-KM-sPCA) and by using information from soil surveys and terrain
attributes derived from a digital elevation model. The protocol involves
three-steps: 1) automatic classification of small (20x20m) spatial units
(SU) using the knowledge of the soil map units present in the farm
landscape, 2) aggregation of SUM at farm scale and 3) validation of
soil-specific zones. For the first step, we used the random forest
algorithm with 10 terrain attributes. For the second step, KM-sPCA
algorithms were used to cluster within field SU accounting for
autocorrelation. For the third step, apparent soil electrical
conductivity and yield maps was used to validate the delimitation of
soil-specific zones. This technique produced more contiguous zones than
other cluster methods which do not use spatiality. Six farm fields with
highly differences in soils were partitioned by the proposed pedometric
strategy. Apparent soil electrical conductivity and yield maps present
significant differences among zones in all experimental fields. This
analytic strategy, based in easy-to-obtain data, could be used to
improve precision agricultural managements.

Abstract:
Soil Security is a holistic soil assessment approach that cogitates soil
as a multi-dimensional medium. Rather than traditional single
dimensional assessment approaches such as land capability mapping that
largely considers only soil and landscape biophysical attributes, the
Soil Security concept considers social aspects, education, policy,
legislation, current land use, condition and the soils natural and
economic value to society. It can identify discrete soils that are
currently being used within their capacity, and areas where a use might
be unsustainable, i.e. not secure. It would therefore make sense to map
this concept, which aligns well with the aspirational and marketing
policies of the Tasmanian Government, where increased agricultural
expansion through new irrigation schemes and multiple-use State managed
production forests co-exists beside pristine World Heritage conservation
land, a major drawcard of the economically important tourism industry.
The spatial quantification of soil security is seen as an emerging tool
to effectively protect the soil resource in terms of food and water
security, biodiversity maintenance and safeguarding fragile ecosystems.
The recent development and application of Digital Soil Mapping and
Assessment capacities in Tasmania to stimulate agricultural production
and better target appropriate soil resource use has formed the
foundational system that can enable the first efforts in quantifying and
mapping Soil Security, in particular the five Soil Security dimensions
(Capability, Condition, Capital, Codification and Connectivity). This
forms a preliminary mapping product that demonstrates the feasibility of
mapping the Soil Security concept. To provide a measure of overall soil
security, it was necessary to separately assess the State's three major
soil uses; Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. These outputs provide
an indication of where different activities are sustainable or at risk,
where more soil data is needed, and develops a tool to better plan for a
State requiring optimal food and fibre production, without depleting its
natural soil resources and impacting the fragile ecosystems providing
environmental benefits and supporting the tourism industry. The
following paper demonstrates why and how we might map Soil Security,
describing a preliminary approach to mapping the separate dimensions;
this approach could be adapted and applied elsewhere as an evaluation
tool to identify soil threats relevant to current land use, biophysical
properties, policy and management, and stimulate further research and
debate into developing a global Soil Security mapping methodology.

Abstract:
Microplastics (< 5 mm) are considered to be emerging pollutants of
global concern. Investigations on microplastics pollution in coastal and
marine environments have increased recently but knowledge gaps still
exist regarding microplastics in coastal beach soils with high-intensity
human activities. In the present study a total of 120 soil samples were
taken from 53 sites along > 3000 km of coastline in Shandong province,
east China, adjacent to both the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea coastlines
under different land use management. Microplastics were separated from
the soil samples using a continuous flow and floating separation
apparatus. The shape type, size, abundance, spatial distribution,
polymer composition and surface morphology of the microplastics were
identified by a range of advanced microscopic and micro-analytical
methods. The analytical results show that seven shape types, namely
foams, pellets, fragments, flakes, fibers, films and sponges, were
present in the beach soils. The polymer composition of the microplastics
included polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, poly-ether urethane
and a polymer blend of both polyethylene and polypropylene.
Approximately 60% of the observed microplastics had a size range < 1 mm.
Microplastic abundance varied greatly among the soils, ranging from 1.3
to 14,712.5 N kg(-1) (dry weight) as influenced by high-intensity human
activities such as mariculture, tourism, and port construction. The
seven shape types of microplastics from the coastal environment had
different weathering surface morphologies, showing scratches, creases,
micropores, cracks, either concave or convex, and of various shapes and
sizes, possibly due to physical friction, photochemical oxidation and/or
animal attack. Algae or crude oil was observed on the surface of some
microplastics. The weathered surfaces of microplastics might act as a
high-capacity carrier with adhering microorganisms and chemicals.
Further studies are required on the weathering processes, sorption
capacity and transport of microplastics especially in smaller size (< 1
mm) under coastal conditions.
