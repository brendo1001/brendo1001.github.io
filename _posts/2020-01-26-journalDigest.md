Abstract
Fire activity has a huge impact on human lives. Different models have been proposed to predict fire activity, which can be classified into global and regional ones. Global fire models focus on longer timescale simulations and can be very complex. Regional fire models concentrate on seasonal forecasting but usually require inputs that are not available in many places. Motivated by the possibility of having a simple, fast, and general model, we propose a seasonal fire prediction methodology based on time series forecasting methods. It consists of dividing the studied area into grid cells and extracting time series of fire counts to fit the forecasting models. We apply these models to estimate the fire season severity (FSS) from each cell, here defined as the sum of the fire counts detected in a season. Experimental results using a global fire detection data set show that the proposed approach can predict FSS with a relatively low error in many regions. The proposed approach is reasonably fast and can be applied on a global scale.

The growing influence of climatic and land-use pressures on soils across broad geographic extents have revealed a need for generalizable indices of soil development applicable at continental scales. In this study, we present generalizable horizon and profile development indices (HDIs and PDIs, respectively) based primarily on relative horizon properties instead of parent material information and provide an evaluation of these indices at a continental scale. The indices developed in this work combine knowledge of pedogenic processes with selected properties from a large database of predominantly US soils to yield relevant soil morphological, physical, and chemical information on 57,171 horizons arising from 8980 pedons. We selected four properties from which the generalizable HDI and PDI calculations were based: particle size, calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), color, and clay films. Modified z-scores were used to assess relative changes between either eluvial and illuvial horizons for particle size and CCE or surface and subsurface horizons for color. These values were then normalized using maximum and minimum values observed in the dataset. Normalized clay film scores were calculated using percent cover along with ordinal values assigned to distinctness categories described in the field. The index values from HDI compared well to both diagnostic horizon designations and chemical index of alteration and PDI values matched the sequence of taxonomic soil orders that represent a development gradient. In addition, we observed a correspondence between calculated PDIs and a clay mineralogy index representing weathering intensity. Relationships between these generalizable indices, evaluation metrics, and climate (i.e., MAP) explored in this work opens the door to numerous broad-scale applications in the future such as pedogenic modeling, identification of soil anomalies, and estimation of surface soil ages.

Because of the difficulty to reach high suction at the residual state of unsaturated soils, the saturation-suction experimental data for soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) is often limited and incomplete, which will lead to unreliable estimation of mechanical and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils. However, no study has been published on how to obtain a reliable SWCC for unsaturated soils with limited experimental data. In response to this situation, an innovative method was proposed based on the analysis of shape characteristics of SWCC with three identified critical points in it. 78 experimental datasets from existing literature were compiled to identify the mathematical relationship among three critical points in the SWCC. The proposed method was evaluated by experimental datasets from this study and existing literature and proved to have a satisfying performance in predicting a complete SWCC for a wide range of soils, from the coarse-grained to the fine-grained. Overall, the research results present an effective and capable method for estimating a more reliable SWCC when experimental data is limited.

Drought indices based on thermal remote sensing have been developed and have merit for effective early warning of agricultural droughts, but approaches so far are relatively complex or sensitive to land surface temperature (LST) estimation uncertainties. Here, we propose the temperature rise index (TRI), a drought index that is comparatively robust and easy to calculate, as the anomaly of the intrinsic morning rise of LST. The underlying principle is that the rate of LST rise between 1.5 and 3.5 h after the sunrise is approximately linear and occurs more rapidly under dry conditions than under wet conditions over vegetated surfaces as a consequence of stomatal control. TRI during the growing seasons of 2010-2014 was calculated over the Australian wheatbelt from LST retrievals from the geostationary Multifunction Transport Satellite-2 (MTSAT-2) instrument. The calculated TRI was compared with indices based on precipitation integrated over 1-, 3- and 6-month time scales, on Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture derived from passive microwave remote sensing, and on vegetation condition (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) derived from optical remote sensing. The various indices were also compared to annual wheat yield over large areas. The correlation coefficient between TRI and precipitation anomaly that serves as an operational drought index in Australia was above 0.6 in general with 3-month integrative time scale for precipitation. TRI produced spatiotemporal dryness patterns that were very similar to those in soil moisture, but with more detail due to its finer resolution. A time lag of > 1 month was found between TRI and observed vegetation condition, supporting the use of TRI in early warning. Among the compared drought indices, TRI explained the largest fraction (35%) of wheat yield variations. TRI correlations with wheat yields peaked higher and earlier by almost one month in comparison to other indices. We conclude that the thermal drought index proposed here shows considerable potential for use in drought early warning as an effective complement.

Remotely sensed Earth observations (EO) have their history firmly rooted in agricultural monitoring, and more recently with applications in food production, food security, and sustainable agriculture. Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth's land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17). We further characterize the applicability and use of EO data products and tools as they correspond with the United Nations Interagency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) Global Indicator Framework. This inventory will be complemented by a discussion of the intersection of other policy mandates with the SDGs in the agriculture and food security contexts, and will conclude with a discussion of approaches to improving awareness of EO value and bridging the gap between policy and EO communities, to the societal benefit of all with no one left behind.

Agriculture provides humanity with food, fibers, fuel, and raw materials that are paramount for human livelihood. Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications.

In this study, we set up a new drone-borne ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for soil moisture mapping. The whole radar system weighs 1.5 kg and consists of a handheld vector network analyzer (VNA) working as frequency domain radar, a lightweight hybrid horn-dipole antenna covering a wide frequency range (250-2800 MHz), a GPS for positioning, a microcomputer with the controlling application, and a smartphone for remote control. Soil moisture is derived from the radar data using full-wave inverse modeling based on the radar equation of Lambot et al. and multilayered media Green's functions. The inversion is performed in the time domain and focuses on the surface reflection. The antenna-drone system is characterized by global reflection and transmission functions which are determined through a calibration procedure. We performed drone-GPR measurements over three different agricultural fields in the loess belt region of Belgium. In this study, we used the 500-700 MHz range to avoid soil surface roughness effects and to focus on the top 10-20 cm of the soil. These fields present a range of landform conditions leading to specific soil moisture distributions. The soil moisture maps were constructed from the local measurements using kriging. The obtained soil moisture maps are in good agreement with the topographical conditions of the fields and aerial orthophotography observations. These results demonstrated the potential and benefits of drone-GPR for fast, high-resolution mapping of soil moisture at the field scale, and to support, e.g., precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.

Surface soil moisture (SSM) has been identified as a key climate variable governing hydrologic and atmospheric processes across multiple spatial scales at local, regional, and global levels. The global burgeoning of SSM datasets in the past decade holds a significant potential in improving our understanding of multiscale SSM dynamics. The primary issues that hinder the fusion of SSM data from disparate instruments are (1) different spatial resolutions of the data instruments, (2) inherent spatial variability in SSM caused due to atmospheric and land surface controls, and (3) measurement errors caused due to imperfect retrievals of instruments. We present a data fusion scheme which takes all the above three factors into account using a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model (SHM), combining a geostatistical approach with a hierarchical model. The applicability of the fusion scheme is demonstrated by fusing point, airborne, and satellite data for a watershed exhibiting high spatial variability in Manitoba, Canada. We demonstrate that the proposed data fusion scheme is adept at assimilating and predicting SSM distribution across all three scales while accounting for potential measurement errors caused due to imperfect retrievals. Further validation of the algorithm is required in different hydroclimates and surface heterogeneity as well as for other data platforms for wider applicability.

Effective land-based solutions to climate change mitigation require actions that maximize soil carbon storage without generating surplus nitrogen. Land management for carbon sequestration is most often informed by bulk soil carbon inventories, without considering the form in which carbon is stored, its capacity, persistency and nitrogen demand. Here, we present coupling of European-wide databases with soil organic matter physical fractionation to determine continental-scale forest and grassland topsoil carbon and nitrogen stocks and their distribution between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter pools. Grasslands and arbuscular mycorrhizal forests store more soil carbon in mineral-associated organic carbon, which is more persistent but has a higher nitrogen demand and saturates. Ectomycorrhizal forests store more carbon in particulate organic matter, which is more vulnerable to disturbance but has a lower nitrogen demand and can potentially accumulate indefinitely. The share of carbon between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter and the ratio between carbon and nitrogen affect soil carbon stocks and mediate the effects of other variables on soil carbon stocks. Understanding the physical distribution of organic matter in pools of mineral-associated versus particulate organic matter can inform land management for nitrogen-efficient carbon sequestration, which should be driven by the inherent soil carbon capacity and nitrogen availability in ecosystems.

There is a clear need for transformative change in the land management and food production sectors to address the global land challenges of climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, combatting land degradation and desertification, and delivering food security (referred to hereafter as "land challenges"). We assess the potential for 40 practices to address these land challenges and find that: Nine options deliver medium to large benefits for all four land challenges. A further two options have no global estimates for adaptation, but have medium to large benefits for all other land challenges. Five options have large mitigation potential (>3 Gt CO(2)eq/year) without adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Five options have moderate mitigation potential, with no adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Sixteen practices have large adaptation potential (>25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects on other land challenges. Most practices can be applied without competing for available land. However, seven options could result in competition for land. A large number of practices do not require dedicated land, including several land management options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied at a large scale, though the impact is scale and context specific, highlighting the need for safeguards to ensure that expansion of land for mitigation does not impact natural systems and food security. A number of practices, such as increased food productivity, dietary change and reduced food loss and waste, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing-up land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other practices, making them important components of portfolios of practices to address the combined land challenges.

Understanding how to manage N inputs to identify the practices that maximize N recovery has been an organizing principle of agronomic research. Because growth in N fertilizer inputs is expected to continue in an ongoing effort to boost crop production over coming decades, understanding how to efficiently manage recovery of fertilizer N will be important going forward. Yet synthesis of published data that has traced the fate of N-15-labeled fertilizer shows that less than half of the N taken up by crops is derived from current-year N fertilizer. The source of the majority of N in crops is something other than current-year fertilizer and the sources are not really known. This is true for maize (only 41% of N in crops was from current-year N fertilizer), rice (32%), and small grains (37%). Recovery of organic fertilizer N (manure, green manure, compost, etc.) in crops is low (27%), though N recovery in subsequent years (10%) was greater than that for mineral fertilizers. Thus, while research on efficiency of N fertilizer use through improved rate, type, location, and timing is important, this research fails to directly address management of the majority of the N supplied to crops. It seems likely that the majority of non-fertilizer N found in crops comes from turnover of soil and crop residue N. We encourage the research community to revisit the mental model that fertilizer is a replacement for N supply from turnover of soil organic N (SON) and consider a model in which N fertilizer augments ongoing SON turnover and makes an important longer term contribution to SON maintenance and turnover. Research focused on the efficient recovery of N current-year fertilizer inputs neglects this potential role for building soil N and managing soil N turnover, which seems likely to be the most important source of crop N.
