Abstract
The geographic pattern of cropland is an important risk factor for invasion and saturation by crop-specific pathogens and arthropods. Understanding cropland networks supports smart pest sampling and mitigation strategies. We evaluate global networks of cropland connectivity for key vegetatively propagated crops (banana and plantain, cassava, potato, sweet potato, and yam) important for food security in the tropics. For each crop, potential movement between geographic location pairs was evaluated using a gravity model, with associated uncertainty quantification. The highly linked hub and bridge locations in cropland connectivity risk maps are likely priorities for surveillance and management, and for tracing intraregion movement of pathogens and pests. Important locations are identified beyond those locations that simply have high crop density. Cropland connectivity risk maps provide a new risk component for integration with other factors—such as climatic suitability, genetic resistance, and global trade routes—to inform pest risk assessment and mitigation.

### Land use/land cover recognition in arid zone using A multi-dimensional multi-grained residual Forest

Abstract
Monitoring arid areas could effectively improve economic, ecological and humanity benefits. It is an effective monitoring approach to recognize the land cover or land use of arid areas through machine learning methods using satellite images. However, there is no public classified dataset for arid areas currently, and hence remote sensing image monitoring in desert areas is restricted. Existing classification methods are not able to fully utilize effective features of satellite images and multi-spectral optical parameters. In this paper, our contributions are as follows: Firstly, we presented a new satellite dataset named the ARID-5 for arid area land cover/land use (LULC) classification, the LULC in arid areas included desert, oasis, Gobi, and water system. Second, we proposed a machine learning algorithm named the multi-dimensional multi-grained residual forest algorithm for LULC recognition on arid areas. In this algorithm, the multi-dimensional multi-grained structure was able to effectively extract image features and spectral information. The residual forest structure mapped probability feature vectors to higher levels for prediction, which effectively improved the reflection of the forest structure on the sample. At the same time, the base estimator was transmitted in cascade layers, and thus the diversity and the accuracy were improved. Experimental results proved that the multi-dimensional multi-grained residual forest showed good classification abilities. Last, we also tested our algorithm on SAT-4 and SAT-6 datasets, which proved the generalization performance of our algorithm.

Abstract
Modeling soil hydraulic properties requires an effective representation of capillary and noncapillary storage and conductivity. This is made possible by using physically comprehensive yet flexible soil hydraulic property models. Such a model (Brunswick [BW] model) was introduced by Weber et al. (2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR024584), and it overcomes some core deficiencies present in the widely used van Genuchten‐Mualem (VGM) model. We first compared the performance of the BW model to that of the VGM model in its ability to describe water retention and hydraulic conductivity data on a set of measurements of 402 soil samples with textures covering the entire range of classes. Second, we developed a simple transfer function to predict BW parameters based on VGM parameters. Combined with our new function, any existing pedotransfer function for the prediction of the VGM parameters can be extended to predict BW model parameters. Based on information criteria, the smaller variance of the residuals, and a 40% reduction in mean absolute error in the hydraulic conductivity over all samples, the BW model clearly outperforms VGM. This is possible as the BW model explicitly accounts for hydraulic properties of dry soils. With the new pedotransfer function developed in this study, better descriptions of water retention and hydraulic conductivities are possible. We are convinced that this will strengthen the utility of the new model and enable improved field‐scale simulations, climate change impact assessments on water, energy and nutrient fluxes, as well as crop productivity in agroecosystems by soil‐crop and land‐surface modeling. The models and the pedotransfer function are included in an R package spsh (https://cran.r‐project.org/package=spsh).


### Trade-offs in greenhouse gas emissions across a liming-induced gradient of soil pH: Role of microbial structure and functioning

Highlights
* Two-year data from a field experiment initiated in 1942, with four liming rates.
* Liming decreased N2O due to increased N2O reduction and by promoting plant growth.
* Liming increased ecosystem respiration with no effects on soil organic carbon.
* Lime application stimulated CH4 oxidation, but high rates decreased CH4 oxidation.


Abstract

Liming is a common agricultural practice to improve crop yields by raising soil pH. Liming also modulates the production and consumption of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in soils, but the direction and strength of such effects are largely unknown. Since lime application is not a dichotomous variable (application or not), but rather can be dosed according to crop requirements, a critical research gap is whether liming effects on GHG emissions are linear or follow alternate relationships. Based on two-years of data from a long-term field-liming experiment (initiated in 1942), we show that the relationship between an established soil pH gradient (pH of 3.77, 4.92, 6.39, and 6.84 in 1 M KCl extracts) and the emission of GHGs deviates from linearity. Liming increased carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from ecosystem respiration, but there were no differences between limed treatments. The increased respiration was due to higher plant carbon (C) inputs and root respiration, enhanced decomposition activity (β-glucosidase) and increased abundance of specific microbial groups (e.g., cellulose-decomposing bacteria). Liming decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to increased N2O reduction via denitrification and by promoting plant growth. Compared with native acidic soil, lime application stimulated methane (CH4) oxidation, but the highest liming rate was least stimulatory. This aligned with the soil CH4 oxidation potential, which was modified by liming-induced changes in soil microbial structure as indicated by phospholipid fatty acid analyses. There were no differences in soil organic C (SOC) content between liming levels, apparently because increased ecosystem respiration rates compensated for higher plant C inputs from limed plots. Overall, our results reveal a fundamental ecological trade-off: applying lime at a rate that maximizes crop yield with low N2O emissions may increase CO2 emissions (not compensated by higher SOC in a sandy soil) and decrease CH4 oxidation compared to liming applications below this level.

### Soil-based, field-specific fertilizer recommendations are a pipe-dream

* Laboratory ring-tests showed large coefficients of variation in soil analyses.
* Estimates of soil N, P and K supply for a single field varied strongly.
* Field-specific recommendations based on a single soil sample were inaccurate.
* Fertilizer with balanced N:P:K content strongly reduced errors in recommendations.


Abstract
Fertilizer recommendations are key for farmers: the investment is relatively large for smallholders and risky with unknown yield responses and variable fertilizer prices. Are agronomists able to provide useful site-specific fertilizer recommendations that reduce these uncertainties? We evaluated the influence of errors introduced due to soil sampling and chemical analysis procedures both within- and among laboratories on fertilizer recommendations. Using what we consider to be conservative estimates of the uncertainty in estimating soil supply of N, P and K in a single composite soil sample, the resulting 90% confidence interval of fertilizer recommendations ranged from 86 to 186, 0–58 and 38–114 kg N, P and K ha−1 respectively. The numerous laboratory services and digital applications providing field-specific recommendations appear to promise more accuracy than soil analysis can realistically deliver. We conclude that a field-specific fertilizer recommendation based on a single composite soil sample is indeed a pipe-dream.
