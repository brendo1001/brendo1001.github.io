Abstract:
Soil texture is an independent and innate soil property and other
dynamic soil properties such as electrical conductivity (EC), organic
carbon (OC) content and cation exchange capacity (CEC) are mostly
dependent on it. An attempt was made to develop a model for numerically
simulating soil texture and also to construct relationships of the
developed model with other soil properties. Hypothetical data of
particle size distribution and our data were used to justify and
validate the newly defined indices. Scatter diagrams showed good
association between the indices and hypothetical data of soil separates.
Moreover, similar trends were observed between the line charts of USDA
soil textural class codes and the indices. Strong correlations (r =
0.78-0.96) were found between the indices and soil separates (sand, silt
and clay) for our data. However, the indices demonstrated moderate
correlations (r = -0.34 to -0.55) with EC and OC of the soils. Strong
nonlinear relationships were found between CEC and the three indices
(R-2 = 0.699, R-2 = 0.732 and R-2 = 0.672 (all P < 0.001). Furthermore,
the variability of EC, OC and CEC within a single USDA textural class
and customised textural index groups were described using the developed
model. The developed indices showed excellent fitness for simulation of
soil texture and demonstrated an extended applicability in terms of
their relationships with soil properties related to soil texture, which
will help in constructing digital soil maps.
