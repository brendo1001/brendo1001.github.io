###  Bibliometric analysis of research on soil health from 1999 to 2018

JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS Volume:  20 Issue:  3 Pages:  1513-1525 Published:  MAR 2020 Context Sensitive Links Close Abstract Purpose Soil health has been a major focus of research by international scholars because it is an important factor that supports human survival and development. However, few scholars have performed bibliometric analyses of research on soil health. This study investigated the current research status and development characteristics of soil health. Materials and methods We performed a bibliometric analysis of documents on soil health from 1999 to 2018 in the Web of Science Core Collection. The bibliometric analysis tools, CiteSpace and HistCite software, were applied. Results and discussion A total of 1629 documents on soil health in the Web of Science Core Collection were identified. From the research status of soil health, the number of publications will continue to increase. Most of the research institutions examining soil health are located in the USA, and there is little cooperation and communication among countries, neither do research institutions in this field. Each country has its own research labs while lab cooperation within individual countries is relatively close. Most documents on the research of soil health have been published in the journal Applied Soil Ecology. In addition, research directions are expanding from the basic study of soil production, soil health indicators, and soil pollution to the comprehensive study of soil ecosystem. Conclusions Bibliometric analysis tools, CiteSpace and HistCite software, provide a comprehensive approach for making predictions regarding trends in the field. This method was used in this study to identify the hotspots, frontiers, and future development of soil health to provide guidance for future research.

Context Sensitive Links Close Abstract Conservation agriculture has been shown to have multiple benefits for soils, crop yield and the environment, and consequently, no-till, the central practice of conservation agriculture, has rapidly expanded. However, studies show that the potential for carbon (C) sequestration in no-till farming sometimes is not realized, let alone the ability to maintain or improve crop yield. Here we present a global analysis of no-till-induced changes of soil C and crop yield based on 260 and 1,970 paired studies; respectively. We show that, relative to local conventional tillage, arid regions can benefit the most from conservation agriculture by achieving a win-win outcome of enhanced C sequestration and increased crop yield. However, more humid regions are more likely to increase SOC only, while some colder regions have yield losses and soil C loss as likely as soil C gains. In addition to site-specific characteristics and management, a careful assessment of the regional climate is needed to determine the potential benefits of adopting conservation agriculture.

###   Marching in step: The importance of matching model complexity to data availability in terrestrial biosphere models
By: Feng, Xue GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY Volume:  26 Issue:  6 Pages:  3190-3192 Published:  JUN 2020 Context Sensitive Links Free Full Text from Publisher Close Abstract This is a Commentary on Paschalis et al. Building models to predict ecosystem responses to future rainfall changes requires closely matching model complexity to data availability. A new study by Paschalis et al. (Global Change Biology, 2020) examines opportunities to improve both data availability and model structure in 10 state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models.
