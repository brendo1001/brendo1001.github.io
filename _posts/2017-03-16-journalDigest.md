Abstract:
More and more ecologists have started to resurvey communities sampled in
earlier decades to determine long-term shifts in community composition
and infer the likely drivers of the ecological changes observed.
However, to assess the relative importance of and interactions among
multiple drivers, joint analyses of resurvey data from many regions
spanning large environmental gradients are needed. In this article, we
illustrate how combining resurvey data from multiple regions can
increase the likelihood of driver orthogonality within the design and
show that repeatedly surveying across multiple regions provides higher
representativeness and comprehensiveness, allowing us to answer more
completely a broader range of questions. We provide general guidelines
to aid the implementation of multiregion resurvey databases. In so
doing, we aim to encourage resurvey database development across other
community types and biomes to advance global environmental change
research.

Abstract:
We propose novel methods for predictive (sparse) principal component
analysis with spatially misaligned data. These methods identify
principal component loading vectors that explain as much variability in
the observed data as possible, while also ensuring that the
corresponding principal component scores can be predicted accurately by
means of spatial statistics at locations where air pollution
measurements are not available. This will make it possible to identify
important mixtures of air pollutants and to quantify their health
effects in cohort studies, where currently available methods cannot be
used. We demonstrate the utility of predictive (sparse) principal
component analysis in simulated data and apply the approach to annual
averages of particulate matter speciation data from national
Environmental Protection Agency regulatory monitors.

Abstract:
Statistical models used to estimate the spatiotemporal pattern in
disease risk from areal unit data represent the risk surface for each
time period with known covariates and a set of spatially smooth random
effects. The latter act as a proxy for unmeasured spatial confounding,
whose spatial structure is often characterized by a spatially smooth
evolution between some pairs of adjacent areal units whereas other pairs
exhibit large step changes. This spatial heterogeneity is not consistent
with existing global smoothing models, in which partial correlation
exists between all pairs of adjacent spatial random effects. Therefore
we propose a novel space-time disease model with an adaptive spatial
smoothing specification that can identify step changes. The model is
motivated by a new study of respiratory and circulatory disease risk
across the set of local authorities in England and is rigorously tested
by simulation to assess its efficacy. Results from the England study
show that the two diseases have similar spatial patterns in risk and
exhibit some common step changes in the unmeasured component of risk
between neighbouring local authorities.

Abstract:
Intermittent disruptions to rainfall patterns and intensity over the
Pacific Ocean lasting up to similar to 1 year have major impacts on
severe weather, agricultural production, ecosystems, and disease within
the Pacific, and in many countries beyond. The frequency with which
major disruptions to Pacific rainfall occur has been projected to
increase over the 21st century, in response to global warming caused by
large 21st century greenhouse gas emissions. Here we use the latest
generation of climate models to show that humans may have contributed to
the major disruption that occurred in the real world during the late
20th century. We demonstrate that although marked and sustained
reductions in 21st century anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions can
greatly moderate the likelihood of major disruption, elevated risk of
occurrence appears locked in now, and for at least the remainder of the
21st century.



### Implementation of a sigmoid depth function to describe change of soil pH with depth

*GEODERMA*, 289 1-10; MAR 1 2017 

Abstract:
Soil pH controls the availability of the majority of plant nutrients, if
not all, and determines the growth environment for plant roots. Profile
depth functions have been used to represent the vertical distribution of
soil attributes and to predict them at continuous depths. This paper
proposes a new model to predict pH for a whole soil profile. Soil
properties including pH are often similar within the plow layer from
mixing during tillage and other agricultural operations. Similarly, soil
pH below the root zone tends to be uniform due to low disturbance,
leaving a transition zone from the bottom of the tillage layer to the
bottom of the root zone due to depth-dependent root density and related
soil processes. Keeping this physical description of agricultural field
soil profile in mind, a closed form equation (model) was developed
similar to a sigmoid curve. The model has 4 parameters including 1) soil
pH at the top of a soil profile, 2) soil pH at the bottom of a soil
profile, 3) hillslope parameter representing steepness of the curve that
is determined by the length of the root zone, and 4) inflection point
representing almost the midpoint of the transition zone or root zone. A
total of 32 soil cores down to about 1.1 m depths were collected from an
agricultural field of Macdonald farm, McGill University. The sub-samples
were taken at every 10 cm and analyzed for soil pH in soil: water
suspension in the laboratory. The measured pH was used to test the
fitting performance of the sigmoid model. Additionally, a global dataset
with 432 profiles with various soil classes, drainage types, land use,
and altitude was also used to test the generality of the new model. The
performance of this model was compared with the results of the commonly
used 3rd order polynomial regression function and the equal-area
quadratic spline function. Good performance of the sigmoid model with
explicit physical explanation showed promise in predicting soil pH at
depths. The spline function had the highest accuracy but lacked a
general trend in its shape and parameters. The polynomial function had
good accuracy and displayed a non-monotonic trend, which can also be
used as a substitute for some profiles with complex variability. (C)


### The nitrogen cycle: A review of isotope effects and isotope modeling approaches

Abstract:
The nitrogen (N) cycle involves a set of N compounds transformed by
plants and microbes. Some of these N compounds, such as nitrous oxide
(N2O) or nitrate (No-3(-)), are environmental pollutants jeopardizing
biodiversity, human health or the global climate. The natural abundances
of the common (N-14) and rare (N-15) stable N isotopes in a given
compound, i.e. the isotopic composition, depend on individual production
and consumption processes. As each process has an individual preference
for the common or rare isotope (isotope effect) the measurement of the
isotopic composition has been identified as a powerful tool for improved
process understanding and source process identification. Both are key
requirements for the development of strategies aiming at mitigating the
release of environmental harmful N compounds. However, up to now, no
comprehensive compilation of N cycle isotope effects is available.A
compilation of isotope effects is also in high demand for testing
biogeochemical models as such models are increasingly used to study N
cycling in ecosystems and across landscapes and regions. Biogeochemical
models are usually calibrated and validated only with single, easily
accessible quantities. The isotopic composition of N compounds has a
high potential to be used as additional, integrative parameter for a
more thorough assessment of simulation results. For instance, the
isotopic composition of soil N is determined by fractionation of the
most relevant processes and, thus, integrates several N cycle processes,
some of which cannot be accessed easily by direct measurement. To
implement isotopic fractionation in ecosystem models and to utilize
those for model validation, the magnitude of the isotope effects
associated with individual transformations in the N cycle need to be
assessed.This review summarizes the available methods to determine N
isotope effects of various key ecosystem processes, thereby
systematically comparing isotope effects for different experimental
conditions and processes, exploring the accuracy of theoretical
calculations of isotope effects and finally, addressing concepts to
implement isotope effects into biogeochemical modeling.Our review shows
that published isotope effects for N processes in soil incubations seem
to be stronger as compared to those in water saturated systems. In
addition to the choice of isotope effects adequate for the respective
ecosystem, the challenge for modeling approaches is the sequential
calculation of isotopic compositions. Associated numerical inaccuracies
can be minimized by controlling the share of reacted substrates, i.e.
the time step. The criterion to determine the time step needs to
consider the strongest isotope effect, required accuracy of the
calculations and the share of substrate consumed from or provided to the
compound pool.The combination of biogeochemical models with delta N-15
methods and novel measures like site preference (SP) of N2O is a
promising approach for improving process understanding at various
spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the compilation of isotope
effects in this review may not only be of benefit for modelers, but also
for experimentalists, as measurement and modeling of isotope effects may
eventually help to test and validate our current process understanding
of the N cycle. 


### The elusive role of soil quality in nutrient cycling: a review

*SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT*, 32 (4):476-486; DEC 2016 

Abstract:
Cycling of nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, is one of the
ecosystem services we expect agricultural soils to deliver. Nutrient
cycling incorporates the reuse of agricultural, industrial and municipal
organic residues that, misleadingly, are often referred to as 'wastes'.
The present review disentangles the processes underlying the cycling of
nutrients to better understand which soil properties determine the
performance of that function. Four processes are identified (i) the
capacity to receive nutrients, (ii) the capacity to make and keep
nutrients available to crops, (iii) the capacity to support the uptake
of nutrients by crops and (iv) the capacity to support their successful
removal in harvested crop. Soil properties matter but it is imperative
that, as constituents of 'soil quality', they should be evaluated in the
context of management options and climate and not as ends in their own
right. The effect of a soil property may vary depending on the
prevailing climatic and hydrologic conditions and on other soil
properties. We recognize that individual soil properties may be
enhancing one of the processes underlying the cycling of nutrients but
simultaneously weakening others. Competing demands on soil properties
are even more obvious when considering other soil functions such as
primary production, purification and flow regulation of water, climate
modification and habitat provision, as shown by examples. Consequently,
evaluations of soil properties and management actions need to be
site-specific, taking account of local aspects of their suitability and
potential challenges.

*SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT*, 32 (4):546-552; DEC 2016 

Abstract:
The change in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union
from product to producer support, including requirements for 'good
agricultural and environmental conditions' and 'greening', is excellent.
However, these requirements are now defined in rather general terms.
Questions can be raised about suitable indicators, and there is a
recognized need for effective management recommendations to support
farmers in achieving the required 'good' conditions. These
recommendations are bound to be quite different for different soils in
different countries. A study of Dutch clay soils was based on a
storyline describing current problems and management options for
improvement, which were quantified using a soil-water-crop simulation
model. Indicators were defined for agricultural conditions and
suggestions made for the use of the model in a predictive mode to help
farmers improve their soil management. Environmental conditions were
judged by current environmental guidelines for water and air. When
modelling, implicit assumptions that soils are homogeneous were shown to
be unrealistic for these clay soils, requiring development of innovative
methods and procedures, presenting a challenge for soil research.


### A review of visual soil evaluation techniques for soil structure

*SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT*, 32 (4):623-634; DEC 2016 

Abstract:
Soil structure forms a key component of soil quality, and its assessment
by semi-quantitative visual soil evaluation (VSE) techniques can help
scientists, advisors and farmers make decisions regarding sampling and
soil management. VSE techniques require inexpensive equipment and
generate immediate results that correlate well with quantitative
measurements of physical and biochemical properties, highlighting their
potential utility. We reviewed published VSE techniques and found that
soils of certain textures present problems and a lack of research into
the influence of soil moisture content on VSE criteria. Generally,
profile methods evaluate process interactions at specific locations
within a field, exploring both intrinsic aspects and anthropogenic
impacts. Spade methods focus on anthropogenic characteristics, providing
rapid synopses of soil structure over wider areas. Despite a focus on
structural form, some methods include criteria related to stability and
resiliency. Further work is needed to improve existing methods regarding
texture influences, on-farm sampling procedures and more holistic
assessments of soil structure.

Abstract:
Atterberg limits and indices, for example liquid limit (LL), plastic
limit (PL), linear shrinkage (LS) and plasticity index (PI), are
important soil properties in engineering and land evaluation for
predicting soil mechanical behaviour. This study was conducted to
develop and evaluate pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to predict Atterberg
limits using measured and morphological soil properties from a large
data set in South Africa covering a vast range of soils, geologies and
climates. Five PTFs were developed; the first four using measured
properties from 2330 soil horizons including extractable Fe, Al, Mn, Na,
K, Mg and Ca; organic carbon (OC); pH (H2O); cation exchange capacity
(CEC); and sand, silt and clay fractions to predict LL, PL, LS and PI.
Morphological descriptors such as colour, structure (grade, size and
type), consistency, occurrence of slickensides and cutans and abundance
of roots were included in the second PTF using data from 717 horizons to
predict PI. For all PTFs, two-thirds of the data were randomly selected
and used for model development and the remainder for validation.
Prediction accuracies of R-2 between 0.49 and 0.77 comparable to other
studies on large data sets but underperformed when compared to localized
data sets. For engineering purposes, sitespecific PTFs for prediction of
Atterberg limits should be developed.

Abstract:
Ped shape is an important property with considerable influence over soil
processes, such as root penetration, water infiltration, and solute
transport. Despite the host of methods employed to quantify other soil
morphological properties, ped shape quantification remains elusive.
Existing methods attempting to quantify soil structure utilize
laboratory techniques that have limitations on sample size and
resolution. Our goal was to overcome these limitations by developing an
approach to quantify ped shape using morphometrics created from
published digital photographs of soil profiles and structure specimens.
In addition, ped shapes from heuristic diagrams and three-dimensional
(3-D) scans of peds were examined. The heuristic diagrams were
quantified to assess ped shapes derived from common conceptualizations
of soil structure, while the 3-D scans were quantified to assess the
effect of ped orientation on shape measurements. Ped shape was
quantified by manually outlining distinct examples of soil peds from
high-resolution photographs and heuristic diagrams and calculating
several morphometrics from the resulting silhouettes using image
analysis software. A survey was designed to poll expert judgment to
properly classify the shape of these peds. Using this method, we were
able to transform typical categorical and subjective descriptions of
peds into continuous quantitative shape data. The shape metrics,
circularity and width to height ratio, exemplify the type of continuous
variables that allow significant differences between ped shapes to be
detected. This approach opens the door to analyzing soil structure at
regional and continental scales through the analysis of existing
photographs without the need to resample.

Abstract:
In this paper, the results of a bibliometric and visual analysis of
geo-ontology research articles collected from the Web of Science (WOS)
database between 1999 and 2014 are presented. The numbers of national
institutions and published papers are visualized and a global research
heat map is drawn, illustrating an overview of global geo-ontology
research. In addition, we present a chord diagram of countries and
perform a visual cluster analysis of a knowledge co-citation network of
references, disclosing potential academic communities and identifying
key points, main research areas, and future research trends. The
International Journal of Geographical Information Science, Progress in
Human Geography, and Computers & Geosciences are the most active
journals. The USA makes the largest contributions to geo-ontology
research by virtue of its highest numbers of independent and
collaborative papers, and its dominance was also confirmed in the
country chord diagram. The majority of institutions are in the USA,
Western Europe, and Eastern Asia. Wuhan University, University of
Munster, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are notable geo-ontology
institutions. Keywords such as "Semantic Web," "GIS," and "space" have
attracted a great deal of attention. "Semantic granularity in
ontology-driven geographic information systems, "Ontologies in support
of activities in geographical space" and "A translation approach to
portable ontology specifications" have the highest cited centrality.
Geographical space, computer-human interaction, and ontology cognition
are the three main research areas of geo-ontology. The semantic mismatch
between the producers and users of ontology data as well as error
propagation in interdisciplinary and cross-linguistic data reuse needs
to be solved. In addition, the development of geoontology modeling
primitives based on OWL (Web Ontology Language) and finding methods to
automatically rework data in Semantic Web are needed. Furthermore, the
topological relations between geographical entities still require
further study.

Abstract:
Many quantitative and qualitative studies in geoscience research are
based on digital elevation models (DEMs) and 3D surfaces to aid
understanding of natural and anthropogenically-influenced topography. As
well as their quantitative uses, the visual representation of DEMs can
add valuable information for identifying and interpreting topographic
features. However, choice of viewpoints and rendering styles may not
always be intuitive, especially when terrain data are augmented with
digital image texture. In this paper, an information theoretic framework
for object understanding is applied to terrain visualisation and terrain
view selection. From a visibility channel between a set of viewpoints
and the component polygons of a 3D terrain model, we obtain three
polygonal information measures. These measures are used to visualize the
information associated with each polygon of the terrain model. In order
to enhance the perception of the terrain's shape, we explore the effect
of combining the calculated information measures with the supplementary
digital image texture. From polygonal information, we also introduce a
method to select a set of representative views of the terrain model.
Finally, we evaluate the behaviour of the proposed techniques using
example datasets. A publicly available framework for both the
visualization and the view selection of a terrain has been created in
order to provide the possibility to analyse any terrain model.

*COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES*, 99 37-49; FEB 2017 

Abstract:
In this study, an intelligent system for mineral identification in thin
sections is proposed based on RGB and HSI color spaces and texture
features in plane and cross polarized light. The proposed system has two
phases for mineral identification. In phase#1, which is the segmentation
phase, 12 color components are extracted for each pixel, and using an
incremental clustering algorithm, several mineral clusters including
index mineral are produced. Afterwards, in phase#2 which is the
identification phase, the produced mineral clusters are identified based
on a cascade classification approach. The first level of the cascade
includes a set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) corresponding to the
number of input minerals which are trained based on color components. In
the first level, those minerals exhibiting different colors in plane or
cross polarized light are identified. The second level of the cascade
includes one ANN which is trained based on texture features in plane and
cross polarized light images. In the second level, those minerals which
are indistinguishable based on color components in both plane and cross
polarized light are identified (are rejected in the first level of the
cascade). The final output of the system is the name and number of
minerals, boundary and percentage of each mineral in thin section, and
eventually the name of probable target rock. The proposed system is able
to recognize 23 test igneous minerals with the overall accuracy of
93.81%. The proposed system can be applied in important applications
which require a real time segmentation and identification map such as
petrography, and NASA Mars Explorations.

Abstract:
Drylands cover 40% of the global terrestrial surface and provide
important ecosystem services. While drylands as a whole are expected to
increase in extent and aridity in coming decades, temperature and
precipitation forecasts vary by latitude and geographic region
suggesting different trajectories for tropical, subtropical, and
temperate drylands. Uncertainty in the future of tropical and
subtropical drylands is well constrained, whereas soil moisture and
ecological droughts, which drive vegetation productivity and
composition, remain poorly understood in temperate drylands. Here we
show that, over the twenty first century, temperate drylands may
contract by a third, primarily converting to subtropical drylands, and
that deep soil layers could be increasingly dry during the growing
season. These changes imply major shifts in vegetation and ecosystem
service delivery. Our results illustrate the importance of appropriate
drought measures and, as a global study that focuses on temperate
drylands, highlight a distinct fate for these highly populated areas.


### Progressive and regressive soil evolution phases in the Anthropocene

Abstract:
Soils have a substantial role in the environment because they provide
several ecosystem services such as food supply or carbon storage.
Agricultural practices can modify soil properties and soil evolution
processes, hence threatening these services. These modifications are
poorly studied, and the resilience/adaptation times of soils to
disruptions are unknown. Here, we study the evolution of pedogenetic
processes and soil evolution phases (progressive or regressive) in
response to human-induced erosion from a 4000-year lake sediment
sequence (Lake La Thuile, French Alps). Erosion in this small lake
catchment in the montane area is quantified from the terrigenous
sediments that were trapped in the lake and compared to the soil
formation rate. To access this quantification, soil processes evolution
are deciphered from soil and sediment geochemistry comparison. Over the
last 4000 years, first impacts on soils are recorded at approximately
1600 yr cal. BP, with the erosion of surface horizons exceeding 10
t.km(-2).yr(-1). Increasingly deep horizons were eroded with erosion
accentuation during the Higher Middle Ages (1400-850 yr cal. BP),
reaching 1000 t.km(-2).yr(-1), and leading to the remobilization of
carbonated and poorly weathered material, hence rejuvenating soil
development. Erosion exceeded the soil formation rate and constituted a
regression in the development of soils. The tolerable erosion limit is
thus defined for erosion from 25 to 30 t.km(-2).yr(-1). Beyond this
limit, the sustainability of the agroecosystem is limited and ecosystem
services decrease. Afterwards, pedogenesis evolved again from
progressive (700-300 yr cal. BP) to regressive (300 yr cal. BP-today)
phases. Erosion was less important during the last 700 years than during
the Middle Ages but with the same weathering stages, indicating that
soils were deeply affected during the Middle-Age and have yet not
recovered. Our results highlight the importance of the human factor in
the pedogenesis over last millennia and suggest that the studied
agro-ecosystem entered the Anthropocene 1400 years ago.

Abstract:
The use of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) for
monitoring ground instability due to landslide events, although
advantageous over large spatial scales, still poses challenges related
to the recurrently complex kinematics of the phenomena or to the
unfavorable settings of the examined areas with respect to steep
topography and vegetated land cover.This paper presents results obtained
by using Multi-temporal InSAR techniques with high resolution TerraSARX
(TSX) data for monitoring the Carlantino landslide, located in the
Daunian Subapennine (Apulia regioh, southern Italy) on a slope
overlooking a water reservoir, and subjected to several investigations
and consolidation works. The targets detected by using Persistent
Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) correspond to urban structures or pen
urban walls and guard rails, while the landslide body is almost
completely devoid of stable targets, due to the widespread vegetation
and variable land cover. To allow stability monitoring, a network of six
Corner Reflectors (CR) was designed and deployed over the landslide test
site. The TSX images were analyzed by using both the PSI processing and
a procedure, based on the double difference analysis of InSAR phase
values on the CR pixels. Despite residual noise and the loss of 2 CRs
due to vandalism, the processing allowed verifying the stability of the
upper and central part of the landslide body, and relating indirectly
the movements at the toe of the landslide to the water level
fluctuations of the reservoir. Finally, this experiment suggests some
recommendations and guidelines in planning CR deployment in complex
landslide sites.

Abstract:
During the last millennia, anthropogenic land cover change has caused a
significant release of carbon from soils while also accelerating rates
of soil erosion by one to two orders of magnitude. However, mechanistic
frameworks that explicitly link land cover change, erosion and soil
organic carbon (SOC) cycling and, in addition, can be applied to longer
timescales are currently lacking. This study presents a 4D
soil-landscape model coupling sediment fluxes and carbon dynamics in
response to continuous land cover change over a period of 1000 years. We
applied the model to a well-studied catchment of 591 km(2) in Central
Belgium. The model evaluation showed that the simulated magnitude and
spatial patterns of soil redistribution and SOC stocks are in good
agreement with field observations. At the catchment scale, land cover
change over the last 1000 years decreased the SOC stock of the top 1 m
of soil by 33.1 tC.ha(-1) (32% loss compared to the initial SOC stock)
while in contrast erosion resulted in an uptake of 31.9 tC.ha(-1) from
the atmosphere (29% gain compared to theinitial SOC stock). As a result,
the combined effect is a small source of c. 1.2 tC.ha(-1) over the last
1000 years. While the SOC released from the soil to the atmosphere
quickly responded to land conversion, the erosion induced sink operated
at a much lower intensity but with a longer duration. These transient
simulations show that the soil carbon budget is highly variable in both
space and time.

Abstract:
The development of accurate visible and near infrared (vis-NIR)
spectroscopy calibration models for selected soil properties based on
mobile measurements is essential for site specific soil management at
fine sampling scale. The objective of the present study was to compare
the mobile and laboratory prediction performance of vis-NIR spectroscopy
for total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC) and soil moisture content
(MC) of field soil samples based on single field (SFD), two-field
dataset (TFD), UK national dataset (UND) and European continental
dataset (ECD) calibration models developed with linear and nonlinear
data mining techniques including spiking. Fresh soil samples collected
from fields in the UK, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark and the
Netherlands were scanned with a fibre-type vis-NIR spectrophotometer
(tec5 Technology for Spectroscopy, Germany), with a spectral range of
305-2200 nm. After dividing spectra into calibration (75%) and
validation (25%) sets, spectra in the calibration set were subjected to
three multivariate calibration models, including the partial least
squares regression (PLSR), multivariate adaptive regression splines
(MARS) and support vector machines (SVM), with leave-one-out
cross-validation to establish calibration models of TN, TC and MC.
Results showed that the best model performance in cross-validation was
obtained with MARS methods for the majority of dataset scales used,
whereas the lowest model performance was obtained with the SFD. The
effect of spiking was significant and the best model performance in
general term was obtained when local samples collected from two target
fields in the UK were spiked with the ECD, with coefficients of
determination (R-2) values of 0.96,0.98 and 0.93, root mean square error
(RMSE) of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.75, and ratio of performance to interquartile
distance (RPIQ) of 7.46, 6.57 and 3.98, for TC, TN and MC, respectively.
Therefore, these results suggest that ECD vis-NIR MARS calibration
models can be successfully used to predict TN, TC and MC under both
laboratory and mobile measurement conditions.

Summary
Soil is a complex and dynamic biological system, and still in 2003 it is difficult to determine the composition of microbial communities in soil. We are also limited in the determination of microbially mediated reactions because present assays for determining the overall rate of entire metabolic processes (such as respiration) or specific enzyme activities (such as urease, protease and phosphomonoesterase activity) do not allow any identification of the microbial species directly involved in the measured processes. The central problem posed by the link between microbial diversity and soil function is to understand the relations between genetic diversity and community structure and between community structure and function. A better understanding of the relations between microbial diversity and soil functions requires not only the use of more accurate assays for taxonomically and functionally characterizing DNA and RNA extracted from soil, but also high-resolution techniques with which to detect inactive and active microbial cells in the soil matrix.

Soil seems to be characterized by a redundancy of functions; for example, no relationship has been shown to exist between microbial diversity and decomposition of organic matter. Generally, a reduction in any group of species has little effect on overall processes in soil because other microorganisms can take on its function.

The determination of the composition of microbial communities in soil is not necessary for a better quantification of nutrient transformations. The holistic approach, based on the division of the systems in pools and the measurement of fluxes linking these pools, is the most efficient. The determination of microbial C, N, P and S contents by fumigation techniques has allowed a better quantification of nutrient dynamics in soil. However, further advances require determining new pools, such as active microbial biomass, also with molecular techniques. Recently investigators have separated 13C- and 12C-DNA, both extracted from soil treated with a 13C source, by density-gradient centrifugation. This technique should allow us to calculate the active microbial C pool by multiplying the ratio between labelled and total DNA by the microbial biomass C content of soil. In addition, the taxonomic and functional characterization of 13C-DNA allows us to understand more precisely the changes in the composition of microbial communities affected by the C-substrate added to soil.

Abstract
Chemical weathering in soils dissolves and alters minerals, mobilizes metals, liberates nutrients to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and may modulate Earth's climate over geologic time scales. Climate-weathering relationships are often considered fundamental controls on the evolution of Earth's surface and biogeochemical cycles. However, surprisingly little consensus has emerged on if and how climate controls chemical weathering, and models and data from published literature often give contrasting correlations and predictions for how weathering rates and climate variables such as temperature or moisture are related. Here we combine insights gained from the different approaches, methods, and theory of the soil science, biogeochemistry, and geomorphology communities to tackle the fundamental question of how rainfall influences soil chemical properties. We explore climate-driven variations in weathering and soil development in young, postglacial soils of New Zealand, measuring soil elemental geochemistry along a large precipitation gradient (400-4700???mm/yr) across the Waitaki basin on Te Waipounamu, the South Island. Our data show a strong climate imprint on chemical weathering in these young soils. This climate control is evidenced by rapid nonlinear changes along the gradient in total and exchangeable cations in soils and in the increased movement and redistribution of metals with rainfall. The nonlinear behavior provides insight into why climate-weathering relationships may be elusive in some landscapes. These weathering thresholds also have significant implications for how climate may influence landscape evolution and the release of rock-derived nutrients to ecosystems, as landscapes that transition to wetter climates across this threshold may weather and deplete rapidly.
