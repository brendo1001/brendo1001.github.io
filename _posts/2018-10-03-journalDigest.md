Abstract:
Coastal areas are vulnerable to the impacts of tropical cyclones (TC),
tsunamis and other water super-elevation events, but the frequency of
these events is often poorly represented by conventional records.
Coastal overwash deposits (including washover fans) can provide a
longer-term archive of event frequency. Because of their low-gradient
geomorphic form, washover fans require high accuracy
(centimetre-resolution) topographic models to understand patterns of
connectivity and dynamics that control archive formation. Using images
collected by a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS, or drone') and
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry techniques, we apply a novel
point-cloud filtering technique based on KMeans classification of the
R-G-B colour of each X-Y-Z point to remove vegetation and create a
centimetre-resolution and accuracy bare-earth digital terrain model
(DTM) of a washover fan in Exmouth Gulf (Western Australia). Using the
RPAS-SfM orphophoto and DEM data, supported by ground-penetrating radar
(GPR) and field stratigraphic analysis, we show how this approach can be
applied to understand dynamics controlling low-gradient geomorphic
landforms, using an example of a washover fan sedimentary archive in
northwestern Australia created by extreme overwash events. Our approach
reveals the likely role of backflooding and terrestrial runoff in
creating backwater environment for sub-aqueous deposition and good
sediment preservation and identifies key areas to target for detailed
dating and stratigraphic analysis of a potentially decadal to
sub-millennial resolution sediment archive of TC activity
