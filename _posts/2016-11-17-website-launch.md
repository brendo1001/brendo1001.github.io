I have always had some interest or wonder into what and how websites are powered. Like where is all this content stored? And how is it all organised? Only recently these questions were more-or-less answered for me.

This was when i undertook a short course on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). It was definetly worth my while. 

So these are just some pointers that i found entirely useful for helping me develop and deploy a website on to the internet. As you can see, this website you are using is the outcome of my learning about this to date. It is by no means a finished product either. 


There are 3 main steps to achieve these ends. 

1. Generate a static site
2. Deploy the site to the Internet
3. Give the website a custom domain name (optional step).

I will just give a rather brief outline of these main steps but be aware that there are many little bumps and bungles to be encountered along the way as developing your own website will introduce you to problems specific to your use case. I have found though that a little intuition and iteration are to best means of finding the way through the issues that crop up. I have found that making a website is actually very fiddly and demands a lot of your time. I would not really describe myself as a computer literate either. More of a hack, but cobbling a few bits and pieces together of other peoples contributions has actually been the way i have floundered through to a result (a working website) that is mine and has my name all over it. It has my own personal brand, and thats what i wanted to achieve. I learned a lot in this process, so lets just get down to business.

```r
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
