Abstract:
Gross primary production (GPP) is a first-order uncertainty in climate
predictions. Large-scale CO2 observations can provide information about
the carbon cycle, but are not directly useful for GPP. Recently carbonyl
sulfide (COS or OCS) has been proposed as a potential tracer for
regional and global GPP. Here we present the first regional assessment
of GPP using COS. We focus on the North American growing season-a global
hotspot for COS air-monitoring and GPP uncertainty. Regional variability
in simulated vertical COS concentration gradients was driven by
variation in GPP rather than other modelled COS sources and sinks.
Consequently we are able to show that growing season GPP in the Midwest
USA significantly exceeds that of any other region of North America.
These results are inconsistent with some ecosystem models, but are
supportive of new ecosystem models from CMIP6. This approach provides
valuable insight into the accuracy of various ecosystem land models.

Abstract:
The scale and magnitude of complex and pressing environmental issues
lend urgency to the need for integrative and reproducible analysis and
synthesis, facilitated by data-intensive research approaches. However,
the recent pace of technological change has been such that appropriate
skills to accomplish data-intensive research are lacking among
environmental scientists, who more than ever need greater access to
training and mentorship in computational skills. Here, we provide a
roadmap for raising data competencies of current and next-generation
environmental researchers by describing the concepts and skills needed
for effectively engaging with the heterogeneous, distributed, and
rapidly growing volumes of available data. We articulate five key
skills: (1) data management and processing, (2) analysis, (3) software
skills for science, (4) visualization, and (5) communication methods for
collaboration and dissemination. We provide an overview of the current
suite of training initiatives available to environmental scientists and
models for closing the skill-transfer gap.


### Scoping for scale-dependent relationships between proximal gamma radiometrics and soil properties

Abstract:
Soil varies from location to location as a result of complex
combinations of soil forming factors and processes operating at
different scales and intensities. The scale-dependent variability in
soil properties causes challenges for the characterization and mapping
of soils. With the advent of technologies, proximal sensors such as
gamma radiometrics can characterize soil spatial variability and the
digital mapping of soil properties. In this study we aim to characterize
scale-dependent variability of proximal gamma radiometrics and its
complex relationship with soil properties at different scales using
wavelet transform and wavelet coherency. We measured gamma radio metrics
(gamma-ray potassium (K-40), uranium (U-238), thorium (Th-232) and Total
Count (gamma-TC)) using a hand-held device in the field every 25 m along
a 3.0 km transect. At each point we measured elevation (m) and land use
and collected soil samples to determine key soil properties (electrical
conductivity EC1:5, pH (CaCl2), soil organic carbon (SOC), cation
exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable potassium (exch. K), and Colwell
P). Wavelet spectra identified significant (P < 0.05) variations at
different scales and locations for both gamma-ray and soil properties.
There were significant localized variations with changes in elevation
and land use also important. In most cases a 'global' Pearson
correlation between the gamma-ray and soil properties was not
significant. In contrast, wavelet coherency provided a more powerful
scale-and location-specific relationship between gamma-ray, elevation
and land use with selected soil properties. For example, a strong
correlation (18% of the area was significant) was detected between land
use and soil EC1:5 at all scales (<100-800 m) in a low drainage
depression. This correlation was due to the localized mobilization of
salts and has implications for the identification of saline land. At
large spatial scales (>800 m) there was significant positive
correlations between gamma-TC and SOC (36% by area). At medium scales
(similar to 400 m) there was significant and positive correlations
between K-40 and CEC (23% by area), but only along the first half of the
transect which was underlain with Bushy Creek Granodiorite. These
findings provide an improved understanding of the spatial variability of
gamma-ray-soil relationships. The approach used shows the scope and
significant potential to use wavelet analysis of gamma-soil property
relationships that are scale-specific and would be useful for digital
soil mapping. Moreover, scale-specific spatial information of soil
properties aids understanding of soil formation processes and it
illustrates an approach to improve future soil sampling strategies.

Abstract:
In this study, a regional revision coefficient is proposed for the
Equivalent Value Factors to better valuate the Sanjiang Plain (in China)
ecosystem services. An index system suitable for the valuation of the
ecosystem services in the Sanjiang Plain is established. The proposed
method can realize the rapid valuation of nine ecosystem service types
of six different terrestrial ecosystems. Through the preliminary
application of the method, the calculated total value of ecosystem
services of the Sanjiang Plain in 2010 was 510.89 billion yuan, of which
the forest ecosystem contributed to 37.85%, followed by water bodies and
wetland ecosystems. The variations among the contributions of the
different ecosystem services are considerable. The contribution
attributed to regulation function was the highest, especially the value
from the hydrological regulation (36.17%) and climate regulation
(16.04%). The Total Economic Value (TEV) method and the Equivalent Value
Factors (EVF) method are compared in this study. Results show that
Equivalent Value Factors derived value of the Sanjiang Plain ecosystem
services is slightly lower than the value obtained by the Total Economic
Value method, i.e., 537.84 billion yuan, of which the total value of the
Feature Services has reached as high as 38.35 billion yuan.

### The impact of cost feedbacks on the land-use dynamics induced by a tradable permit market

*ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY*, 29 82-86; MAR 2017 

Abstract:
The costs of conserving land for species generally vary in space and
time. In addition, they are not exogenous to the land-use dynamics but
develop endogenously. This gives rise to feedback loops because the
costs determine the land use dynamics which in turn determine the costs.
This cost feedback is likely to affect the effectiveness of biodiversity
conservation instruments that target land use in a spatially explicit
manner. In the present paper a model of a tradable permit market with
agglomeration bonus is extended for the consideration of cost feedbacks
such that the presence of conserved land in the neighborhood may
increase or decrease the local cost. The model analysis demonstrates
that the in the former case the level of spatial clustering of conserved
land is reduced while in the latter case it is increased. Clustering of
conserved land is important for many species and thus cost feedbacks
will eventually affect the survival of species and need to be considered
in the design of conservation instruments.

Abstract:
The fate of the terrestrial biosphere is highly uncertain given recent
and projected changes in climate. This is especially acute for impacts
associated with changes in drought frequency and intensity on the
distribution and timing of water availability. The development of
effective adaptation strategies for these emerging threats to food and
water security are compromised by limitations in our understanding of
how natural and managed ecosystems are responding to changing
hydrological and climatological regimes. This information gap is
exacerbated by insufficient monitoring capabilities from local to global
scales. Here, we describe how evapotranspiration (ET) represents the key
variable in linking ecosystem functioning, carbon and climate feedbacks,
agricultural management, and water resources, and highlight both the
outstanding science and applications questions and the actions,
especially from a space-based perspective, necessary to advance them.


### Using the 500 m MODIS land cover product to derive a consistent continental scale 30 m Landsat land cover classification

Authors:

*REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT*, 197 15-34; AUG 2017 

Abstract:
Classification is a fundamental process in remote sensing used to relate
pixel values to land cover classes present on the surface. Over large
areas land cover classification is challenging particularly due to the
cost and difficulty of collecting representative training data that
enable classifiers to be consistent and locally reliable. A novel
methodology to classify large volume Landsat data using high quality
training data derived from the 500 m MODIS land cover product is
demonstrated and used to generate a 30 m land cover classification for
all of North America between 20 degrees N and 50 degrees N. Publically
available 30 m global monthly Web-enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) products
generated from every available Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 5 TM image for
a three year period, that are defined aligned to the MODIS land products
and are consistently pre-processed data (cloud-screened, saturation
flagged, atmospherically corrected and normalized to nadir BRDF adjusted
reflectance), were classified. The MODIS 500 m land cover product was
filtered judiciously, using only good quality pixels that did not change
land cover class in 2009, 2010 or 2011, followed by automated selection
of spatially corresponding 30 m GWELD temporal metric values, to define
a large training data set sampled across North America. The training
data were sampled so that the class proportions were the same as the
North America MODIS land cover product class proportions and
corresponded to 1% of the 500 m and <0.005% of the 30 m pixels. Thirty
nine GWELD temporal metrics for every 30 m North America pixel location
were classified using (a) a single random forest, and (b) a locally
adaptive method with a random forest classifier derived and applied
locally and the classification results spatially mosaicked together. The
land cover classification results appeared geographically plausible and
at synoptic scale were similar to the MODIS land cover product. Detailed
visual inspection revealed that the locally adaptive random forest
classifications and associated classification confidences were generally
more coherent than the single random forest classification results. The
level of agreement between the 30 m classifications and the MODIS land
cover product derived training data was assessed by bootstrapping the
random forest implementation. The locally adaptive random forest
classification had higher overall agreement (95.44%, 0.9443 kappa) than
the single random forest classification (93.13%, 0.9195 kappa). The
paper concludes with a discussion of future research including the
potential for automated global land cover classification.

*REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT*, 196 224-237; JUL 2017 

Abstract:
In this study, the added utility of nonlinear rescaling methods relative
to linear methods in the framework of creating a homogenous soil
moisture time series has been explored. The performances of 31 linear
and nonlinear rescaling methods are evaluated by rescaling the Land
Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture datasets to
station-basedwatershed average datasets obtained over four United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
watersheds. The linear methods include first-order linear regression,
multiple linear regression, and multivariate adaptive regression splines
(MARS), whereas the nonlinear methods include cumulative distribution
function matching (CDF), artificial neural networks (ANN), support
vector machines (SVM), Genetic Programming (GEN), and copula methods.
MARS, GEN, SVM, ANN, and the copula methods are also implemented to
utilize lagged observations to rescale the datasets. The results of a
total of 31 different methods show that the nonlinear methods improve
the correlation and error statistics of the rescaled product compared to
the linear methods. In general, the method that yielded the best results
using training data improved the validation correlations, on average, by
0.063, whereas ELMAN ANN and GEN, using lagged observations methods,
yielded correlation improvements of 0.052 and 0.048, respectively. The
lagged observations improved the correlations when they were
incorporated into rescaling equations in linear and nonlinear fashions,
with the nonlinear methods (particularly SVM and GEN but not ANN and
copula) benefitting from these lagged observations more than the linear
methods. The overall results show that a large majority of the
similarities between the LPRM and watershed average datasets are due to
linear relations; however, nonlinear relations clearly exist, and the
use of nonlinear rescaling methods clearly improves the accuracy of the
rescaled product. 

### Mapping urban land cover from high spatial resolution hyperspectral data: An approach based on simultaneously unmixing similar pixels with jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis

*REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT*, 196 324-342; JUL 2017 

Abstract:
In remote sensing data exploitation, spectral mixture analysis is
commonly used to detect land cover materials and their corresponding
proportions present in the observed scene. In recent years, high spatial
resolution airborne hyperspectral images have shown their potential for
deriving accurate land cover maps. In this paper, a new spectral mixture
analysis model for mapping urban environments using high spatial
resolution airborne hyperspectral data is proposed. First, non-local
self-similarity is exploited to partition the scene into groups of
similar pixels. The spectral signals of the pixels in each of these
groups are assumed to be comprised of the same endmembers, but with
different abundance values. Then, the similar pixels in each group are
simultaneously unmixed using a jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis
method. The proposed method was applied to map land cover in Pavia city,
northern Italy, using airborne ROSIS data. An overall classification
accuracy of 97.24% was achieved for the Vegetation - Impervious surface
- Soil model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis model is well suited for
mapping land cover in urban environments using high resolution
hyperspectral data. 

### Optimal organic carbon values for soil structure quality of arable soils. Does clay content matter?

*GEODERMA*, 302 14-21; SEP 15 2017 

Abstract:
Most soil structure-related physical properties are correlated to soil
organic carbon (SOC) content. Texture, mineralogy, and SOC:clay ratio
are also acknowledged to affect physical properties, however there is no
consensus or general conclusions in this respect. Against this
background, the present study aims at determining objectives for the
management of SOC in terms of structural quality of agricultural soils.
The large area in which 161 free-to-swell undisturbed samples were
obtained for this research represents a major part of the Swiss
agricultural land and belongs to one broad soil group (Cambi-Luvisols).
The structural quality was scored visually, and bulk volumes (inverse of
bulk density) were measured at standard matric potentials. To define the
effect of SOC without interference of soil mechanical degradation, soils
with good structural quality scores were considered first in studying
the relationship between SOC and soil pore volumes. Results suggest that
the relationship is always linear, irrespective of the clay content of
the soils. No optimum of SOC corresponding to a fraction of the clay
content is found, contrary to the theory of "complexed organic carbon"
(Dexter et al., 2008). However, the SOC:clay ratio decreases with
decreasing soil structure quality. The SOC:clay ratio of 1:8 is the
average for a very good structure quality. A SOC:clay ratio of 1:10 is
the limit between good and medium structural quality,, thus it
constitutes a reasonable goal for soil management by farmers. A SOC:clay
ratio of 1:8 or smaller leads to a high probability of poor structural
state. These ratios can be used as criteria for soil structural quality
and SOC management, and in that context, the concept of complexed
organic carbon appears relevant.


### Use of bimodal hydraulic property relationships to characterize soil physical quality

Authors:
Reynolds, WD

*GEODERMA*, 294 38-49; MAY 15 2017 

Abstract:
Soil hydraulic properties have a predominating impact on soil physical
quality (SPQ) because they directly or indirectly control air and water
storage, infiltration and drainage, nutrient leaching, microbial
activity, greenhouse gas generation, and carbon sequestration. The
hydraulic properties of many soils are often better described using
"bimodal" water content and hydraulic conductivity (theta-K-h)
functions, where the theta-K-h of a large-pore "structure domain" is
combined with the theta-K-h of a small-pore "matrix domain". This study
uses closed-form bimodal van Genuchten theta-K-h functions to
characterize SPQ from the perspective of storage and transmission of
water and air in soils containing distinct structure and matrix domains.
Consistently good fits were achieved between the soil water content
function, theta(h), and water content data from intact soil, repacked
diatomite pellets, and repacked soil aggregates (R-2 >= 0.9854, RMSE <=
0.0223 m(3) m(-3)), but variable fits were attained between the
hydraulic conductivity function, K(h), and hydraulic conductivity data.
It was found that even though the SPQ of bulk soil may be optimal or
near-optimal, the SPQ of the corresponding structure and matrix domains
could be limited or poor in one or more categories. The structure domain
tended to be water-limited and potentially prone to leaching, while the
matrix domain tended to be aeration-limited and potentially prone to
greenhouse gas generation. It was concluded that maximizing the economic
and environmental performance of field crop production would likely
require selective improvement of structure or matrix SPQ rather than
bulk soil SPQ.

### Relationship between soil clay mineralogy and carbon protection capacity as influenced by temperature and moisture

Singh, M; Sarkar, B; Biswas, B; Bolan, NS; Churchman, GJ

*SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY*, 109 95-106; JUN 2017 

Abstract:
Environmental conditions like temperature and moisture could affect the
carbon protection capacity of various clay types in soils. Using
dominantly kaolinitic-illitic, smectitic and allophanic soils, we
conducted systematic incubation experiments over 42 days at different
temperatures (4, 22 and 37 degrees C) and moisture contents (30, 60 and
90% of water holding capacity (available water)). The basal respiration
was monitored to study the relative effect of moisture contents and
temperature on the carbon protection capacities and mechanisms of the
three clay types. The results indicated that carbon decomposition
increased with increasing moisture and temperature. A two-component
quadratic equation could explain the carbon mineralisation process. The
highest C respiration was observed at 37 degrees C with a 60% moisture
level in each of the soil types. Under these conditions, the smectitic
soil recorded the highest carbon decomposition followed by the
kaolinitic-illitic and allophanic soils. The study of the priming effect
using C-14 lab-died malic acid confirmed the trend of the bulk
respiration results. The allophanic soil showed the lowest amount of
carbon mineralisation under all experimental conditions. A strong
inverse correlation (R-2 = 0.90 at p < 0.05) was observed between CO2
emission rate and total sesquioxides (Fe and Al oxides) content. As
evidenced by the pore size distribution, micromorphologies and
thermogravimetric analyses, the microporous structure and micrbaggregate
formation in the allophanic soil enhanced carbon sequestration. This
study indicated that soil carbon stabilisation was related more to the
sesquioxides content than to the clay types or their relative specific
surface areas.

### Salinity risk assessment using fuzzy multiple criteria evaluation

Buchanan, S; Huang, J; Triantafilis, J

*SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT*, 33 (2):216-232; JUN 2017 

Abstract:
For agricultural productivity, primary salinity constitutes a hazard.
Understanding the risk of secondary salinization is also important and
it is necessary to map all these hazards and the overall risk. One
approach is digital soil mapping. We have developed hazard maps of root
zone (0-2 m) and subsurface (6-12 m) salinity, as well as groundwater
height, using empirical best linear unbiased prediction using proximal
and remotely sensed ancillary data. To convert the hazards into salinity
risk maps and account for some uncertainty, fuzzy membership functions
(FMF) were used in conjunction with semantic import models that consider
the vulnerability of agricultural crops. Therefore, we developed
memberships (mu) to three salinity risk classes and created maps of
each, including root zone (mu(RSR)) and subsurface (mu(SSR)) salinity,
and depth to groundwater (mu(GTR)). To estimate groundwater (mu(GSR))
and overall salinity risk (mu(OSR)), fuzzy multiple criteria evaluation
was undertaken. To account for mu(GSR), the mu(SSR) and mu(GTR) were
combined using a t-norm operator, and mu(OSR) was accounted for by
combining mu(RSR) and mu(GSR) using a t-conorm operator. The approach
was applied to an area growing irrigated cotton. Cross-validation shows
predicted mu(OSR) was good, with an agreement rate of 70.6%. The
predicted mu(OSR) was consistent with that of many areas affected by
point-source salinity. The method provides an effective way of mapping
salinity hazard and risk. Incorporation of FMF provides a meaningful
continuum of membership and allows the incorporation of uncertainty.
Salinity risk can be calculated relative to any vegetation community and
locations where management actions to moderate soil salinization can be
identified.

### Spatial aggregation of soil property predictions in support of local land management

*SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT*, 33 (2):299-310; JUN 2017 

Abstract:
Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of Digital Soil
Mapping have emerged to respond to the need of land managers. One
important contribution to this effort is the release of regional-scale
soil maps from the GlobalSoilMap (GSM) project. While the GSM project
aims at producing soil property predictions on a fine 90 x 90 m grid at
the global scale, land managers often require aggregated information
over larger areas of interest (e.g. farms, watersheds, municipalities).
This study evaluated a geostatistical procedure aiming at aggregating
GSM grids to a land management scale, thereby providing land suitability
maps with associated uncertainty for the French region
'Languedoc-Roussillon' (27 236 km(2)). Specifically, maps were derived
from three GSM prediction grids (pH, organic carbon and clay content) by
calculating the proportion of 'suitable' agricultural land within a
municipality, where suitability was defined as having soil property
values below or above a predefined threshold (pH<5.5, OC<10 g/kg,
clay>375 g/kg). Calculation of these nonlinear spatial aggregates and
the associated uncertainty involved a three-step approach: (i) sampling
from the conditional probability distributions of the soil properties at
all grid cells by means of sequential Gaussian simulation applied to a
regression kriging model, (ii) transformation of soil properties to
suitability indicators for all grid cell samples generated in the first
step and (iii) spatial aggregation of the suitability indicators from
grid cells to municipalities. The maps produced show large differences
between municipality areas for all three land suitability indicators.
The uncertainties associated with the aggregated suitability indicators
were moderate. This approach demonstrated that fine-scale GSM products
may also fulfil user demands at coarser land management scales, without
jeopardizing uncertainty quantification requirements.

Abstract:
The concept of soil health has been extensively reviewed in the
scientific literature, but there is only patchy and inconsistent
information available to farmers and growers who are concerned about the
declining condition of their soils and are looking for appropriate test
methods and management interventions to help reverse it. Although there
are well-established laboratory methods for soil chemical analysis, and
a range of laboratory and field methods for measuring soil physical
properties, only now are methods starting to emerge for soil biological
analysis. This study provides an overview of the methods that are
currently available commercially (or are close to commercialization) for
farmers and growers in the UK. We examine the science underpinning the
methods, the value of the information provided and how farmers and
advisors can use results from such assessments for informed
decision-making in relation to soil management.

### Soil protection for a sustainable future: options for a soil monitoring network for Ireland

*SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT*, 33 (2):346-363; JUN 2017 

Abstract:
The increased recognition of the importance of soil is reflected in the
UN Post-2015 Development Agenda with sustainable development goals that
directly and indirectly relate to soil quality and protection. Despite a
lack of legally binding legislation for soil protection, the European
Commission remains committed to the objective of soil protection.
However, the achievement of a legally binding framework for soil
protection relies on the implementation of a soil monitoring network
(SMN) that can detect changes to soil quality over time. As
beneficiaries do not pay for the provision of soil information, the
options for soil monitoring are limited. The use of existing data sets
should be considered first. Using Ireland as an example, this research
explored the opportunities for a SMN for Ireland considering three
existing national data sets. The options for a SMN are considered in
terms of their spatial and stratified distribution, the parameters to be
measured and an economic analysis of the options proposed. This research
finds that for Ireland, either a 10 or a 16 km(2) grid interval
stratified by land use and drainage class offers the best potential in
relation to the spatial distribution of existing data sets to reflect
local data at a national level. With existing data, the stratified SIS
data using the 16 km(2) grid offers the best value for money, with
baseline costs for analysis, excluding field costs, of between (sic)706
481 and (sic)2.8 million. Acknowledging the impossibility of measuring
all parameters with ideal frequency, this study proposes a two-tier
system for optimized monitoring frequency. Parameters must anticipate
future policy requirements. Finally, the implementation of a SMN must be
accompanied by standardized methods, defined thresholds and action
mandates to maintain soil quality within allowable limits.


### How accurately can soil classes be allocated based on spectrally predicted physio-chemical properties?

*GEODERMA*, 303 78-84; OCT 1 2017 

Abstract:
Soil class maps are useful representations of the landscape distribution
of holistic soil functions. However these are often only available as
generalized classes at small cartographic scales. One reason is that
allocating a soil profile to a class in most current soil classification
system requires laboratory determination of many diagnostic soil
properties. The advantage of reflectance spectroscopy along with the
development of spectral libraries can provide a relatively low-cost
solution to this problem. Reflectance spectroscopy has demonstrated its
ability to rapidly predict soil physio-chemical properties; however
prediction accuracy varies among soil properties. When properties
predicted with different accuracies are used to substitute for
traditional laboratory determinations in allocating a soil profile to a
class, the resulting reliability of the allocation is questionable. The
objective of this research is to explore whether the soil properties
predicted by reflectance spectroscopy can be used to correctly allocate
soil profiles into soil taxa at different hierarchical levels. Two
hundred and six soil profiles were allocated to eight Orders, 12
Suborders, 23 Groups and 49 Subgroups according to Chinese Soil
Taxonomy, with the help of ten soil properties predicted by spectra
using ten-fold cross-validated PLSR modelling. The overall allocation
accuracy at Order, Suborder, Group and Subgroup level was 98.5%, 98.5%,
87.7% and 76.0% respectively. These results show that soil reflectance
spectroscopy can assist in allocation of profiles. When predicted soil
properties with varying accuracy are used for soil allocation,
propagation of prediction errors and model uncertainties must be
considered. We propose the use of multiple indicators (RPD, confidence
intervals, comparison of RMSE and threshold requirements) to evaluate
the allocation results.

accuracy for digital soil mapping (DSM). In this study, we attempted to
explore a methodology of wavelet analysis on this topic. The terrain
attributes of a study area were decomposed using the wavelet analysis,
and the resulted components were applied to map soil organic carbon
(SOC) content, pH and clay content using multiple linear regression
(MLR) and regression kriging (RK). The results showed that the wavelet
components strengthened soil-landscape relationships in terms of
correlation coefficients, enhanced soil-landscape modelling in terms of
MLR modelling coefficients of determination (R-2). Compared with several
standard DSM approaches, i.e., ordinary kriging (OK), MLR and RK with
the original terrain attributes, the use of wavelet components improved
the prediction accuracy at some scales, but not all the scales. Most of
the improvements were at the slight to moderate levels, e.g.,
3.66-14.24% increases in the accuracy based on mean error, mean absolute
error, root mean square error and R-2. Maps made with wavelet components
were relatively smooth and sometimes contained hotspots due to
characteristics of wavelet components, which differed a lot from those
made by the standard DSM methods. The potential benefits of using
wavelet components as predictors in DSM may be further revealed in the
future when more predictor selection approaches and mapping methods are
considered.

Abstract:
As soil oxidizable carbon (Cox) has several different absorptions in the
visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) region due to its complex
composition, multivariate calibration techniques such as multiple linear
regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support
vector machines (SVM) or random forest (RF) can be advantageously used
to obtain a good prediction. Besides that, the content of Cox is often
affected by the character of the terrain, mainly due to prevailing water
regime with associated transport and sedimentation processes. Therefore,
the question arises; if predictive models calibrated by combining
vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (vis-NIR DRS, 350-2500 nm) and
the digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives will provide a more
accurate estimate of Cox. Focused on a sloping arable land (100 ha)
affected by distinct water erosion, we tested for this purpose two
conceptually different predictive approaches that differ in the nature
of the spectroscopic predictor variables. In Approach A that relied on
absorption feature (AF) parameters, the inclusion of DEM derivatives
resulted in improved Cox prediction using all the tested calibration
techniques, i.e. MLR, RF, PLSR and SVM. The MLR prediction that was the
most accurate among all others improved from R-CV(2) = 0.81 (vis-NIR DRS
dataset) or 0.50 (DEM derivatives dataset) to 0.84 (combination of
both). For that prediction especially AF centered at 500, 700, 900,
1800, 1900, 2200 and 2400 rim, as well as elevation, IS factor and plan
curvature were important. In contrast, in the Approach B that relied on
reflectance (RF and PLSR) or normalized reflectance (SVM) values at each
wavelength, no positive effect of inclusion of DEM derivatives was
observed.

Abstract:
This study evaluates the use of magnetic properties as an indicator of
weathering of tropical soils. Soil samples collected across the tropical
belt were analysed for magnetic susceptibility and its frequency
dependence. Frequency dependence is caused by superparamagnetic (SP)
ferrimagnetic nanoparticles, which are commonly attributed to
neoformation during soil forming processes. Magnetic properties are
compared to the redness rating of soil colour, which is related to the
hematite content and is an established proxy for soil weathering. The
investigated samples comprise material of different weathering stages
from unweathered and weathered rock to subsoil and strongly weathered
topsoil. They cover a broad variety of parent materials: ultrabasic,
basic, intermediate, acid igneous rocks, clays and clay slates,
phyllites and sandstones. The results show that soil reddening, magnetic
susceptibility and in particular frequency-dependent susceptibility
generally increase with proceeding weathering. However, there is a
lithologic overprint and the parent material has to be taken into
consideration. Soils stemming from acid igneous rocks, clays, clay
slates and phyllites show a positive correlation between reddening and
susceptibility or frequency dependent susceptibility, rendering these
properties suitable for indicating weathering. In contrast, soils
stemming from ultrabasic, basic and intermediate igneous rocks and
sandstones show no significant correlation. The reason is the strong
lithogenic overprint of ferrimagnetic minerals including SP particles,
which commonly occur in these rock types.

Abstract:
Increasingly, the frequency domain electromagnetic induction (EMI)
method is used to study soil properties and hydrological properties on
different scales. Yet, EMI data are most often used as they are or with
the low induction number approximation. Moreover, reported studies have
been fairly small (< 100 ha) and to our best knowledge quantitative
comparisons with boreholes have not been reported. In the present study
we collect, process and invert a 1000 ha EMI data set, and we directly
compare the EMI data with borehole data. EMI data were collected with a
line spacing of 20 m, resulting in approximately 110,000 processed
soundings, which were inverted with a full non-linear algorithm. The EMI
results were then evaluated against lithological information from 125
boreholes. The results show that with an EMI instrument we can map the
shallow (< 6 m) architecture on small-catchment scale (1000s ha) in a
complicated glacial sedimentary environment. The mapping of the
geological units was evaluated by a quantitative analysis in which we
developed a general methodology for directly comparing EMI results and
borehole data. After linking geological units to measured resistivities,
we found that 103 out of 125 boreholes were reproduced by the EMI
results. We attributed the few non-reproducible boreholes to be caused
by local scale geological units, abrupt lateral variations in either
geology or resistivity, and inaccurate borehole coordinates. We conclude
that EMI can provide the architectural input with the necessary detail
and quality to characterize areas of up to 1000s ha.

Abstract:
Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes tools and technologies to identify
in-field soil and crop variability for improving farming practices and
optimizing agronomic inputs. Traditionally, optical remote sensing (RS)
that utilizes visible light and infrared regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum has been used as an integral part of PA for crop and soil
monitoring. Optical RS, however, is slow in differentiating stress
levels in crops until visual symptoms become noticeable. Surface
temperature is considered to be a rapid response variable that can
indicate crop stresses prior to their visual symptoms. By measuring
estimates of surface temperature, thermal RS has been found to be a
promising tool for PA. Compared to optical RS, applications of thermal
RS for PA have been limited. Until recently (i.e., before the
advancement of low cost RS platforms such as unmanned aerial systems
(UAVs)), the availability of high resolution thermal images was limited
due to high acquisition costs. Given recent developments in UAVs,
thermal images with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become
available at a low cost, which has increased opportunities to understand
in-field variability of crop and soil conditions useful for various
agronomic decision-making. Before thermal RS is adopted as a routine
tool for crop and environmental monitoring, there is a need to
understand its current and potential applications as well as issues and
concerns. This review focuses on current and potential applications of
thermal RS in PA as well as some concerns relating to its application.
The application areas of thermal RS in agriculture discussed here
include irrigation scheduling, drought monitoring, crop disease
detection, and mapping of soil properties, residues and tillage, field
tiles, and crop maturity and yield. Some of the issues related to its
application include spatial and temporal resolution, atmospheric
conditions, and crop growth stages.

Abstract:
Comparing functional similarity in reconstructed ecosystems with natural
benchmarks can provide ecologically meaningful information to measure
reclamation success. We examined nutrient supply rate using ion-exchange
resins as a measure of ecosystem function in two oil sands reclaimed
soils, viz. peat mineral mix (PMM) and forest floor mineral mix (FFMM),
and measured fertilization effect on nutrient supply rates in these
soils for three consecutive years contrasted with young-fire-disturbed
and mature forest stands. Results indicated that nutrient profiles of
reclaimed soils were significantly different than natural benchmarks.
Phosphorus and potassium supply rates in reclaimed soils were up to 91%
lower, whereas S, Ca, and Mg were, respectively, up to 95%, 62%, and 74%
higher than in benchmark soils. The expected nutrient flush
postfertilization was only apparent in N and P, but the transient effect
levelled off the year after fertilization in most cases. Fertilization
aligned the temporal trajectory of the nutrient profile in PMM similar
to benchmark conditions indicating greater ecological benefit of
fertilization than in FFMM. The findings from this study suggest that
fertilization focusing on P and K is likely more ecologically
appropriate for establishing natural ecosystem function on reclaimed
soils in this region of the boreal forest.

Abstract:
Magnetic susceptibility (chi) is a simple and quick technique to
determine soil properties and to describe soil forming processes.
Knowledge about factors affecting chi data helps better interpretation.
Magnetic susceptibility of soils along a lithotoposequence was studied
in this research in order to investigate the effects of soil forming
factors (parent material and relief) and processes on the chi content
and its vertical distribution. The study area is a transect from Jiroft
to Kahnooj area, south Kerman Province, Iran. Rock pediment, mantled
pediment, inselberg, alluvial fan, alluvial plain, and flood plain
landforms with igneous parent materials (gabbro, diorite, and granite)
were selected in the area. Thirteen representative pedons on different
geomorphic positions were studied. Low frequency chi (chi lf) values
ranged from 193.1 x 10-8 m(3) kg(-1) to 2704.2 x 10-8 m(3) kg(-1) in
studied soils and decreased with increasing diamagnetic material
contents. Mean chi lf values in soils formed on gabbro, diorite, and
granite parent rock were > 1700 x 10(-8) ma kg(-1), 515.22 x 10(-8) m(3)
kg(-1), and 352.53 x 10(-8) m(3) kg(-1), respectively. Frequency
dependent chi of soils (in the range of 0.06 to 1.05%) showed that
coarse multi domain grains inherited from igneous parent material were
the main source of chi lf in the area under study. Both increasing and
decreasing trends of chi lf with depth were observed. Decreasing trend
of chi lf with depth was due to illuviation of diamagnetic material into
subsurface layers. On the other hand, increasing chi lf with depth was
attributed to the primary ferrimagnetic material inherited from igneous
parent material. Alluvial plain (320.44 x 10(-8) m(3) kg(-1)) and
mantled pediment (328.50 x 10(-8) m(3) kg(-1)) showed low values of chi
lf due to high amounts of soluble salts, anhydrite, and calcium
carbonate investigated in these geomorphic positions. A positive
significant relationship (R-2 = 0.018; r = 0.27, P < 0.05) between chi
lf and Fe-o/Fe-d activity ratio was found. Soil chi lf decreased with
development and relative dating of soils. Results of the study showed
that soil chi lf values were highly affected by parent material, relief,
and soil development.

Abstract:
Accurate estimation of the crop coefficient (K-c) is crucial for
estimating actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) and planning appropriate
irrigation management for efficient crop yield. In this study,
satellite-based K-c values were estimated at cropland and mixed forest
sites based on the dual crop coefficient approach using merged soil
moisture from the European Space Agency as an indicator of evaporation
from soil, as well as the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the
Leaf Area Index (LAI) to explain the effect of transpiration from
plants. Comparison of the seasonal patterns and Pearson's correlation
coefficient (r) of NDVI, LAI, and surface soil moisture with K-c
indicated that it was reasonable to use the three variables as
independent variables to estimate K-c. Based on these results, the
satellite -based K-c estimated using NDVI, LAI, and soil moisture (Case
1) was compared with the K-c calculated from NDVI and LAI (Case 2) and
the flux towers at the significance level of 0.05. The statistical
results confirmed that the K-c estimated from Case 1 (Bias: -0.012 to
0.053, RMSE: 0.144 to 0.172, and r: 0.463 to 0.800) showed better
agreement with the observed K-c than that estimated from Case 2 (Bias:
-0.058 to 0.088, RMSE: 0.146 to 0.221, and r: 0.434 to 0.788). Among the
three variables, soil moisture had the greatest impact on the rice
paddy, while the NDVI showed the highest influence on the mixed forest.
Based on these results, K-c estimated from Case 1 was multiplied by
MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based potential
crop evapotranspiration and compared with the latent heat flux from flux
towers. ETa showed reasonable bias (cropland: -0.224 to 1.364, mixed
forest: 0.711 to 1.055), RMSE (cropland: 1.952 to 2.126, mixed forest:
1.085 to 1.878) and r (cropland: 0.529 to 0.832, mixed forest: 0.850 to
0.909) at all of the study sites. After validation of the satellite
-based K-c approach under various vegetation types and climate
conditions, this approach can be employed not only for developing
adequate water and agricultural management plans, but also for analyzing
and predicting crop yield productivity and agricultural drought.
