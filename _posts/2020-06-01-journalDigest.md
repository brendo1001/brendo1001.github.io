Remote sensing images contain abundant land cover information. Due to the complex nature of land cover, however, mixed pixels exist widely in remote sensing images. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) is a technique for predicting the spatial distribution of land cover classes within mixed pixels. As an ill-posed inverse problem, the uncertainty of prediction cannot be eliminated and hinders the production of accurate sub-pixel maps. In contrast to conventional methods that use continuous geospatial information (e.g., images) to enhance SPM, in this paper, a SPM method with point constraints into SPM is proposed. The method of fusing point constraints is implemented based on the pixel swapping algorithm (PSA) and utilizes the auxiliary point information to reduce the uncertainty in the SPM process and increase map accuracy. The point data are incorporated into both the initialization and optimization processes of PSA. Experiments were performed on three images to validate the proposed method. The influences of the performances were also investigated under different numbers of point data, different spatial characters of land cover and different zoom factors. The results show that by using the point data, the proposed SPM method can separate more small-sized targets from aggregated artifacts and the accuracies are increased obviously. The proposed method is also more accurate than the advanced radial basis function interpolation-based method. The advantage of using point data is more evident when the point data size and scale factor are large and the spatial autocorrelation of the land cover is small. As the amount of point data increases, however, the increase in accuracy becomes less noticeable. Furthermore, the SPM accuracy can still be increased even if the point data and coarse proportions contain errors.

There is a growing realization amongst policy-makers that reliable and accurate soil monitoring information is required at scales ranging from regional to global to support ecosystem functions and services in a sustainable manner under the amplifying climate change enabling countries in target setting of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this line, the need of access to and integration of existing regional in situ Earth Observation (EO) data and different sources such as contemporary and forthcoming satellite imagery is highlighted. The current study puts major emphasis on leveraging existing open soil spectral libraries and EO systems and bridging them with memory-based learning algorithms that create more cost-efficient and targeted large scale mapping of soil properties. Relying mostly on contemporary capacities and open resources it can be readily applied to countries with differing capacities and levels of development. To test our methodology, the GEOCRADLE SSL developed in the Balkans, Middle East, and North Africa region and a hyperspectral airborne image were utilized to provide Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) maps of cropland fields over an agricultural region near the city of Netanya, Israel. Furthermore, simulated data of forthcoming space-borne satellite (EnMAP) and current super-spectral mission (Sentinel 2) were explored. The SOC content of the collected in situ soil samples was predicted using a novel local regression approach that combines spatial proximity and spectral similarities. These predictions were subsequently used to develop models using the airborne and simulated satellite spectra, achieving a fair prediction accuracy of R-2 > 0.8 and RPIQ > 2.

Decision-making that impacts sustainability occurs at national and subnational levels, highlighting the need for multi-scale Earth observations (EO) and geospatial data for assessing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). EnviroAtlas, developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and partners, provides a collection of web-based, interactive maps of environmental and socio-economic data relevant to the SDGs. EnviroAtlas maps ecosystem services indicators at national, regional, and local extents that can contribute to targets set forth in numerous goals, such as SDG 6 for clean water, SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 15 for life on land. Examples of EnviroAtlas indicators that provide a way to view spatial inequalities, help fill gaps in environmental indicators, and integrate socio-economic and environmental data for the SDGs are explored herein. Remotely sensed EO data are essential for producing these indicators and informing planning and decision-making for the SDGs at subnational scales. The National Land Cover Dataset is the basis for many EnviroAtlas maps at the national extent, while National Agriculture Imagery Program and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are used to classify Meter-scale Urban Land Cover in select US metro areas. These 30 m and 1 m land cover products are combined with demographic and other geospatial data (remotely sensed and otherwise) to produce integrated indicators that can aid in target setting of the SDGs. Though EnviroAtlas was created for the conterminous US, the methods for indicator creation are transferable, and the open-source code for the EnviroAtlas resource may serve as an example for other nations. Achieving the SDGs means assessing targets and decision-making outcomes at local, regional, and national levels using consistent and accurate data. Geospatial resources like EnviroAtlas that provide open access to indicators based on EO data and allow for assessment at multiple extents and resolutions are critical to broadly addressing national to subnational SDG goals and targets.

This paper presents a community effort to develop good practice guidelines for the validation of global coarse-scale satellite soil moisture products. We provide theoretical background, a review of state-of-the-art methodologies for estimating errors in soil moisture data sets, practical recommendations on data pre-processing and presentation of statistical results, and a recommended validation protocol that is supplemented with an example validation exercise focused on microwave-based surface soil moisture products. We conclude by identifying research gaps that should be addressed in the near future.

### Agricultural drought mitigating indices derived from the changes in drought characteristics

Droughts can cause tremendous losses to agricultural and economic development; humans have explored many anti-drought measures to mitigate the influence of drought and accordingly altering the characteristics of actual agricultural drought. In this study, a method is proposed to detect the spatiotemporal changes in drought characteristics, which show the effects of anti-drought measures on drought mitigation. Two agricultural drought mitigation evaluation indices are proposed, the agricultural drought frequency change (ADFC) and agricultural drought area change (ADAC), which are calculated by combining the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and vegetation health index (VHI), two widely used drought monitoring indices. The PDSI and VHI represent the natural and actual agricultural drought severity under natural and actual conditions respectively, and their differences in drought frequency and affected area reflect the level of anti-drought measures in mitigating agricultural drought. The feasibility of using ADFC and ADAC to quantify the effects of anti-drought measures for agriculture is explored using data from six typical agricultural provinces in the North China Plain and Northeast China. The results show that ADFC and ADAC could reflect both the spatiotemporal changes in agricultural drought characteristics and the influence of anti-drought measures on agricultural drought. The trend of the drought mitigation index is consistent with agricultural activity statistics. These two indices could be further used to evaluate the effects of different anti-drought methods and aid in defeating agricultural drought across many countries.

Choosing an optimal strategy for hierarchical group testing is an important problem for practitioners who are interested in disease screening with limited resources. For example, when screening for infectious diseases in large populations, it is important to use algorithms that minimize the cost of potentially expensive assays. Black and co-workers described this as an intractable problem unless the number of individuals to screen is small. They proposed an approximation to an optimal strategy that is difficult to implement for large population sizes. We develop an optimal design with respect to the expected total number of tests that can be obtained by using a novel dynamic programming algorithm. We show that this algorithm is substantially more efficient than the approach that was proposed by Black and co-workers. In addition, we compare the two designs for imperfect tests. R code is provided for practitioners.

Context Sensitive Links  Close Abstract
sen2r is a scalable and flexible R package to enable downloading and preprocessing of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery via an accessible and easy to install interface. It allows the execution of several preprocessing steps which are commonly performed by Sentinel-2 users: searching the Sentinel-2 archive for datasets available over a spatial area of interest and in a defined time window, downloading them, applying the Sen2Cor atmospheric correction algorithm to compute surface reflectances, merging adjacent files, performing geometric transformations, applying a cloud mask, computing spectral indices and colour images. The package is designed to be accessible to a range of users, from beginners to skilled R users. It comes with a Graphical User Interface, which can be used to set the processing parameters and launch processing operations: this feature makes sen2r accessible also for novices with limited programming experience. High-level R functions, which enable customised image processing workflows and control over intermediate steps, can be useful to experienced remote sensing researchers. Thanks to those functions it is possible to easily schedule automatic processing chains, so to manage massive processing operations. This paper describes the main characteristics, functionalities and performance of the package and highlights its usefulness as the operational back-end of service-oriented architectures, as illustrated by the SATURNO project.

Context Sensitive Links  Close Abstract
Geostatistical interpolation methods are used in diverse disciplines, such as environmental science, ecology, and hydrology. With the increasing availability of areal spatial data, area-to-area and area-to-point interpolations have great application potential. In this study, based on the variogram deconvolution algorithm proposed by Goovaerts (2008), an open-source area-to-area kriging package atakrig is developed in the R environment. In atakrig, point-scale variogram and cross-variogram can be automatically deconvoluted from spatial areal samples. It provides a general framework for area-to-area and area-to-point ordinary kriging and cokriging. Two applications show that the package works well in river runoff prediction and missing data interpolation for remote sensing aerosol optical depth. The package can be deployed on different operating systems and computer hardware platforms.

###  Content search within large environmental datasets using a convolution neural network

By: Freeman, J.

Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated a high level of performance in the areas of image recognition and classification. The training of such networks over large corpora of imagery has facilitated additional applications such as content-based image searching and retrieval. Here we investigate the efficacy of applying a pre-trained deep CNN to the task of content searching within large environmental datasets. It is demonstrated that the learned convolution filters from a pre-trained network provide sufficient fidelity and diversity to accurately perform a content search within a dataset that is unrelated to the CNN training data.
