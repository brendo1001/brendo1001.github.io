Abstract:
Sustainable intensification (SI) has been proposed as a possible solution to the conflicting problems of meeting projected increases in food demand and preserving environmental quality. SI would provide necessary production increases while simultaneously reducing or eliminating environmental degradation, without taking land from competing demands. An important component of achieving these aims is the development of suitable methods for assessing the temporal variability of both the intensification and sustainability of agriculture. Current assessments rely on traditional data collection methods that produce data of limited spatial and temporal resolution. Earth Observation (EO) provides a readily accessible, long-term dataset with global coverage at various spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper we demonstrate how EO could significantly contribute to SI assessments, providing opportunities to quantify agricultural intensity and environmental sustainability. We review
  an extensive body of research on EO-based methods to assess multiple indicators of both agricultural intensity and environmental sustainability. To date these techniques have not been combined to assess SI; here we identify the opportunities and initial steps required to achieve this. In this context, we propose the development of a set of essential sustainable intensification variables (ESIVs) that could be derived from EO data.

Abstract:
Water is preferentially conducted away from the soil surface through large cracks formed in shrink-swell soils, which complicates our ability to calculate the partitioning of water into infiltration and runoff. Preferential flow paths affect the hydrology of a landscape but often are not included in hydrology models. The Precision Agricultural-Landscape Modeling System (PALMS) contains a Mesopore and Matrix (M&M) module that allows preferential flow and was tested on cracking soil at the pedon and small watershed scale for this study. Four irrigation events were conducted on 10-m by 10-m plots of a cracking soil, and volumetric water content (VWC) output for PALMS with and without the M&M module was compared with that measured by a neutron moisture meter. Additionally, measurements of VWC on a 4.4-ha small watershed were compared with PALMS predictions. At both scales, the M&M module simulated water movement down the soil profile more quickly and eliminated unobserved ponding
  at the pedon scale relative to the PALMS matrix only. Simulations of water content of the soil profile were generally improved when the M&M module was used. Furthermore, PALMS M&M was relatively easy to parameterize using obtainable and physically relevant parameters, rendering it applicable to shrink-swell soils in a variety of systems.

Abstract:
Infiltration in soils is a key process that partitions precipitation at the land surface into surface runoff and water that enters the soil profile. We reviewed the basic principles of water infiltration in soils and we analyzed approaches commonly used in land surface models (LSMs) to quantify infiltration as well as its numerical implementation and sensitivity to model parameters. We reviewed methods to upscale infiltration from the point to the field, hillslope, and grid cell scales of LSMs. Despite the progress that has been made, upscaling of local-scale infiltration processes to the grid scale used in LSMs is still far from being treated rigorously. We still lack a consistent theoretical framework to predict effective fluxes and parameters that control infiltration in LSMs. Our analysis shows that there is a large variety of approaches used to estimate soil hydraulic properties. Novel, highly resolved soil information at higher resolutions than the grid scale of LSMs ma
 y help in better quantifying subgrid variability of key infiltration parameters. Currently, only a few LSMs consider the impact of soil structure on soil hydraulic properties. Finally, we identified several processes not yet considered in LSMs that are known to strongly influence infiltration. Especially, the impact of soil structure on infiltration requires further research. To tackle these challenges and integrate current knowledge on soil processes affecting infiltration processes into LSMs, we advocate a stronger exchange and scientific interaction between the soil and the land surface modeling communities.
