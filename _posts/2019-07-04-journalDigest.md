Abstract:
The temporal consistency of the fAPAR GEOV2 full time series (constituted by data derived from SPOT-VGT1/2 and PROBA-V) is analyzed against the single-sensor MODIS dataset, with a particular focus on the most recent fAPAR anomalies (z-scores) produced from PROBA-V in the period 2014-2017. The intercomparison highlights a systematic overestimation of GEOV2 fAPAR z-scores when compared to MODIS fAPAR, likely related to the observed positive bias (over 90% of the domain) in the PROBA-V vs. SPOT-VGT1/2 relationship. A simple two-step harmonization procedure has been proposed to remove this discrepancy, based on two separate linear corrections of SPOT-VGT1/2 (2001-2013) and PROBA-V (2014-2017) data with respect to MODIS, followed by a time lag correction. The harmonized GEOV2 time series preserves the overall dynamic of fAPAR, while removing the sensor bias and improving the consistency with MODIS data. The fAPAR anomalies from the harmonized GEOV2 time series provide unbiased est
 imates of z-scores that are overall well correlated (R = 0.55 +/- 0.25) with the MODIS fAPAR anomalies.

Abstract:
Vegetation cover in savannas is characterized by high spatial heterogeneity driven by natural and anthropogenic drivers acting at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This research article identifies trends in vegetation cover and productivity in response to both land management and variable precipitation through a methodological approach that incorporates vegetation transect fieldwork with satellite imagery time series analysis. The phenological cycles of semi-arid savanna vegetation were analyzed over 27 years for both a protected area and a privately-owned property in order to capture multiple vegetation cover categories within the eastern Edwards Plateau ecoregion of central Texas. Line-intercept vegetation transects were established across these two sites in 2015, with ground cover and structural vegetation measurements collected along each transect. These measurements were classified based upon distinct vegetation cover categories: woodland, intermediate, open, and ope
 n disturbed. Time series analysis of vegetation productivity utilized 111 multi-season Landsat TM5 and Landsat 8 images that captured spring, fall, and winter seasonalities across the 27-year time period spanning from 1988 to 2015, with the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) calculated as an indicator of vegetative productivity. Harmonic regression was applied to this time series in order to determine the relationship between time of year with respect to growing season and productivity level across vegetation cover types. Fixed mean harmonic amplitudes for calendar year productivity were calculated across the entire time period as well as across three natural breaks-based sub-divisions of the 27-year period. Mean amplitudes per transect were then plotted against field-truthed tree-grass ratios in order to determine the relationship between tree and grass cover and mean harmonic SAVI amplitude. Harmonic regression identified inter- and intra-annual seasonal variability acr
 oss cover types, with woodland sites exhibiting much lower v!
 ariability in SAVI levels than open sites. These results provide insight into the phenological response of vegetation cover types typical of semi-arid savannas to spatially and temporally variable precipitation levels and land management schemes, allowing for better informed management and monitoring strategies for these environments.

Abstract:
The red-edge bands place the recently available multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery at an advantage over other multispectral sensors, and hypothetically offer improved crop biophysical variable retrieval accuracy. In this study, Sentinel-2 data was tested for its ability to estimate winter wheat leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). Artificial neural network (ANN) and look-up table (LUT) (based on PROSAIL simulations) and vegetation index (VI) methods were applied to retrieve biophysical parameters, and compared with the biophysical processor module embedded in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software. Based on a set of in situ measurements (62 samples) and near-synchronous Sentinel-2 images, the inversion approaches were applied and validated. The results showed that: 1) Sentinel-2 red-edge bands improved the retrievals of chlorophyll / LAI compared to traditional VIs; 2) the red-edge VIs outperformed other approach
 es; and 3) the SNAP biophysical processor obtained comparable accuracies of LAI and CCC estimation compared to the ANN and LUT approaches, giving R-2 values above 0.5 with relatively low RMSE (1.53 m(2)/m(2) for LM, and 148.58 mu g/cm(2) for CCC). We recommend VI retrieval approach for small region with ground measurements, whereas where ground data is not available, SNAP is applicable for versatile and rapid winter wheat parameter estimation (though results need to be evaluated alongside the provided quality indicators). Summarizing, the results demonstrate the suitability of Sentinel-2 data, especially its red-edge bands, for crop biophysical variables retrieval. Future studies will need to make comparisons across canopy types to better assess the capability of the SNAP biophysical processor.

Abstract:
Earth Observation (EO) allows deriving from a range of sensors, often globally, operational estimates of surface soil moisture (SSM) at range of spatiotemporal resolutions. Yet, an evaluation of the accuracy of those products in a variety of environmental conditions has been often limited. In this study, the accuracy of the SMOS SSM global operational product across 2 continents (USA, and Europe) and a range of land use/cover types is investigated. SMOS predictions were compared against near concurrent in-situ SSM measurements from the FLUXNET observational network. In total, 7 experimental sites were used to assess the accuracy of SMOS derived soil moisture for 2 complete years of observations (2010-2011). The accuracy of the SMOS SSM product is investigated in different seasons for the seasonal cycle as well as different continents and land use/cover types. Results showed a generally reasonable agreement between the SMOS product and the in-situ soil moisture measurements in
  the 0-5 cm soil moisture layer. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in most cases was close to 0.1 m(3 )m(-3) (minimum 0.067 m(3) m(-3)). With a few exceptions, Pearson's correlation coefficient was found up to approx. 55%. Grassland, shrublands and woody savanna land cover types attained a satisfactory agreement between satellite derived and in-situ measurements but needle-leaf forests had lower correlation. Better agreement was found for the grassland sites in both continents. Seasonally, summer and autumn underperformed spring and winter. Our study results provide supportive evidence of the potential value of this operational product for meso-scale studies in a range of practical applications, helping to address key challenges present nowadays linked to food and water security.

Abstract:
Surface-enhanced spectroscopy (SES) is a consequence of extreme electromagnetic fields and chemical interactions near a surface. SES is highly sensitive and selective and has been exploited in chemistry, physics, biology, and medicine. It is a rapidly developing technique and is expected to become an important analysis tool. This review introduces theories and concepts of SES techniques including surface-enhanced (SE) Raman scattering, SE infrared absorption, SE chiroptical spectroscopy, and SE fluorescence. Then recent research and applications are discussed to indicate current challenges and future directions.

Abstract:
The lower Fraser Valley is one of the most intensively cropped regions in Canada. Yet, how soil health indicators respond to long-term intensive agricultural management is poorly documented in this region. Thus, we evaluated a suite of soil health indicators in response to 21 growing seasons of continuous silage corn (Zea mays L.) under conventional tillage or no-tillage (0 - 20 cm soil layer). Wet aggregate stability, available water capacity, active carbon (permanganate oxidizable, POXC), and extractable potassium and extractable magnesium were significantly greater with no-till than conventional tillage, whereas 8 of 13 indicators were similar. Soil health indicators responded more favourably to no-till than conventional tillage.

Abstract:
Four enzymes activities (EAs) have been targeted as soil health indicators for their important role in reactions releasing bioavailable nutrients within C (beta-glucosidase), N and C (beta-glucosaminidase), P (acid phosphomonoesterase) and S (arylsulfatase) cycling. Traditionally these EAs are assayed independently on air-dried soil by measuring the release of p-nitrophenol from a substrate analog. Previously, we suggested a novel approach to assess multiple EAs simultaneously in the same soil sample by adding two or three substrates to obtain a comparable index. Our current study provides a combined assay for simultaneous determination of these four EAs in the same soil sample. For the incubation step of our combined assay, we tested modified universal buffer (MUB) because it is used for assaying beta-glucosidase and acid phosphomonoesterase activities and tested acetate buffer as it is used for assaying beta-glucosaminidase and arylsulfatase activities. Using the acetate bu
 ffer (pH 5.8) for the combined assay showed the lowest percent of difference (average of - 14%) compared with the sum of individual EAs, and showed positive significant correlations (p < 0.001) with the sum of the individual EAs (r = 0.97) and with soil organic C (r = 0.94) and total nitrogen (TN) (r = 0.93). This combined acetate buffer assay ("CNPS activity") differentiated among agroecosystems similarly to the sum of the individual EAs in Texas soils (cotton < grass < Conservation Reserve Program) and both approaches showed a tendency for higher activities in a diversified rotation compared to corn-soybean and a grass system for Minnesota soils. Use of the novel CNPS activity will provide a uniform biogeochemical cycling index while reducing time and resources compared to assaying the EAs individually.
