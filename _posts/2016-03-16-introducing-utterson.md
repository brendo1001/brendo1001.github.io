title: Introducing Utterson
---

Utterson was built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and  [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), a vanilla Jekyll install. It was designed and developed by [@alidcastano](https://twitter.com/alidcastano), to provide a minimal and unassuming theme, focused on what matters: you and your content.

Utterson provides a fully-functional setup:

* **Home Page with according navigation** makes your site is easy to navigate.
* **Sliding email subscription form** lets you can build your audience in a an unobtrusive manner. 
* **Simple Contact Form** with [Formspree](http://www.formspree.io/), provides a way for your your readers easily reach you by email, without you having to reveal personal information. 
* **Scrolling navigation bar** for posts lets readers can easily go back to your home page. 
* **Fade-in footer** allows you to have one last call to action at the bottom of each post, without getting in the way of your content. 

Also, building off Poole's vanilla install:

* **A holistic Jekyll setup** (Layouts, config, [archive page](/archive), [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), example pages and posts.)
* **Easily scalable** text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS.
* **Mobile Friendly Design** so that your site can be accessed on any device.

If you'd like to see the theme in action, you can see it live on my [site](http://alidcastano.com/).

And, in case you're interested, these are three other themes, also built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) on Poole: [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), [Enfield](http://enfield.getpoole.com). But, if I'm honest, you're best of picking this one. (;
