Abstract:
We document the existence of widespread firn aquifers in an elevation
range of similar to 1200-2000 m, in the high snow-accumulation regions
of the Greenland ice sheet. We use NASA Operation IceBridge accumulation
radar data from five campaigns (2010-2014) to estimate a firn-aquifer
total extent of 21,900 km(2). We investigate two locations in Southeast
Greenland, where repeated radar profiles allow mapping of aquifer-extent
and water table variations. In the upper part of Helheim Glacier the
water table rises in spring following above-average summer melt, showing
the direct firn-aquifer response to surface meltwater production
changes. After spring 2012, a drainage of the firn-aquifer lower margin
(5 km) is inferred from both 750 MHz accumulation radar and 195 MHz
multicoherent radar depth sounder data. For 2011-2014, we use a
ground-penetrating radar profile located at our Ridgeline field site and
find a spatially stable aquifer with a water table fluctuating less than
2.5 m vertically. When combining radar data with surface topography, we
find that the upper elevation edge of firn aquifers is located directly
downstream of locally high surface slopes. Using a steady state 2-D
groundwater flow model, water is simulated to flow laterally in an
unconfined aquifer, topographically driven by ice sheet surface
undulations until the water encounters crevasses. Simulations suggest
that local flow cells form within the Helheim aquifer, allowing water to
discharge in the firn at the steep-to-flat transitions of surface
topography. Supported by visible imagery, we infer that water drains
into crevasses, but its volume and rate remain unconstrained.
