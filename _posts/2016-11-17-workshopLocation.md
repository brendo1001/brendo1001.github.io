=======================================================

### *Soil Spectral Inference Workshop*

### March 30 - April 1, 2016

### General information and getting there...

This three-day intensive workshop will present all you need to know about soil spectral inference, how to process your spectral data, and make inferences about soil properties, including soil carbon and clay mineralogy. We will guide you through the fundamental principles and 'hands-on' computer practicals. It will use the popular open-source statistical software, <tt> R </tt>. All codes will be made available so you will be able to process your own data.

The presenters for the workshop will include:

-   Brendan Malone (USYD)
-   Uta Stockmann (USYD)
-   Mario Fajardo (USYD)
-   Edward Jones (USYD)
-   Budiman Minasny (USYD)
-   Alex McBratney (USYD)
-   Jason Ackerson (Texas A & M University)
-   Philippe Lagacherie (INRA Montpellier)
-   Graeme Batton (USYD)

The Workshop will be delivered at Sydney Soil Schools, Faculty of Agriculture & Environment. Specifically, you will need to go to **Level 1 Computing Laboratory, Biomedical Building Australian Technology Park, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia** (*see map below*). The easiest points of reference to navigate by are Central and Redfern Train Stations. On the map below we show a suggested walking route from Redfern Train Station. The Workshop will get underway at 9am each day and finish at 5pm.

### What do you need to bring?

Other than your personal items there is not much else you will need. Some people bring their own laptops and storage devices. A laptop is not necessary though, as we will provide you with visitor login access to use our own computer terminals. We will also provide lunches and snacks. The workshop building also has all the standard amenities.
 Part of the workshop includes a general introduction to the [<tt> R </tt>](https://cran.r-project.org/) computing language. If you want some general familiarization with this software before the workshop, follow the links and install it onto your own computer. To interact with <tt> R </tt> we will be using the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE. This software will make <tt> R </tt> easier to use.
 We are looking forward to meeting you and providing this important and topical workshop. See you at the end of march.
