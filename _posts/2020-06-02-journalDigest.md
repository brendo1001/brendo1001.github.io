We tested one front-end data fusion method to combine visible near-infrared (vis-NIR) and portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectra for predicting different soil properties and investigated the contribution of different sensor data. A total of 197 soil samples were collected from 25 Alfisols and Mollisols in south-central Wisconsin, USA. Soils were analysed in the laboratory for clay, sand, silt content, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and pH. Air-dried soil samples were scanned with vis-NIR and PXRF spectrometers. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to each of the vis-NIR and PXRF spectra to extract the first 10 principal components (PCs), which were used in the Cubist model. Five types of input data were compared for constructing the models using a front-end data fusion approach, including: (a) 10 PCs from vis-NIR spectra, (b) 10 PCs from spectra of PXRF beam 1 (XRF40), (c) 10 PCs from spectra of PXRF beam 2 (XRF10), (d) concatenating 20 PCs from two PXRF spectra (XRF40 + 10), and (e) concatenating 30 PCs from two PXRF spectra and vis-NIR spectra (XRF40 + 10 + NIR). In addition, the performances of the preprocessing methods (four smoothing methods with or without background removal) of PXRF spectra were compared. Multiple linear regression was also used to predict soil properties directly from 11 PXRF-estimated elements. Our results suggest that smoothing should be applied to the PXRF spectra prior to developing predictive models. PXRF spectra and elemental data can predict soil texture with validation R-2 > 0.85, better than using solely vis-NIR spectra, and combining vis-NIR and PXRF spectra improved the prediction. Combining PXRF and vis-NIR can also predict TC and TN moderately well. Soil pH cannot be predicted from vis-NIR or PXRF spectra in this dataset due to its weak correlations with other soil properties and elements. It is concluded that PXRF spectra can be solely used to estimate soil texture, whereas combining vis-NIR and PXRF spectra via PCA should be used to estimate TC and TN. Highlights
The use of front-end data fusion method to combine vis-NIR and PXRF spectra for predicting soil properties. Different preprocessing algorithms were compared systematically for PXRF spectra. Spectral smoothing should be applied to the PXRF spectra prior to developing predictive models. PXRF spectra can be used solely to estimate soil texture, whereas combining vis-NIR and PXRF spectra via PCA should be used to estimate TC and TN.

In boundary line analysis a biological response (e.g., crop yield) is assumed to be a function of a variable (e.g., soil nutrient concentration), which limits the response in only some subset of observations because other limiting factors also apply. The response function is therefore expressed by an upper boundary of the plot of the response against the variable. This model has been used in various branches of soil science. In this paper we apply it to the analysis of some large datasets, originating from commercial farms in England and Wales, on the recorded yield of wheat and measured concentrations of soil nutrients in within-field soil management zones. We considered boundary line models for the effects of potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) on yield, comparing the model with a simple bivariate normal distribution or a bivariate normal censored at a constant maximum yield. We were able to show, using likelihood-based methods, that the boundary line model was preferable in most cases. The boundary line model suggested that the standard RB209 soil nutrient index values (Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, nutrient management guide (RB209), 2017) are robust and apply at the within-field scale. However, there was evidence that wheat yield could respond to additional Mg at concentrations above index 0, contrary to RB209 guidelines. Furthermore, there was evidence that the boundary line model for yield and P differs between soils at different pH and depth intervals, suggesting that shallow soils with larger pH require a larger target P index than others. Highlights
Boundary line analysis is one way to examine how soil variables influence crop yield in large datasets. We showed that boundary line models could be applied to large datasets on soil nutrients and crop yield. The resulting models are consistent with current practice for P and K, but not for Mg. Models suggest that more refined recommendations for P requirement could be based on soil pH and depth.

Soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) represents the carbon losses from the decomposition of litter detritus and soil organic matter by microorganisms. Despite conflicting findings on the dominant climatic, soil and vegetation controls on RH from local studies, little is known on the global patterns of RH and the potential drivers behind these patterns. Based on the updated Global Soil Respiration Database, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of climatic, soil and vegetation controls on RH across the globe using structure equation model (SEM). Our results showed that the global weighted mean RH was 457 +/- 139 g C m(-2) a(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation), but RH differed significantly among ecosystem types and positively correlated with gross primary production, highlighting the importance of the vegetation control on RH. Climate was the most important environmental control on RH indicated by SEM. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content had a negative influence on RH at the global scale, challenging the current understanding that SOC leads to a positive effect on RH at site or ecosystem scale, further indicating that SOC quantity may dominate RH at local scales, while SOC quality and availability may dominate RH at regional or global scales. Great differences were found not only between observed and dymanic global vegetation model (DGVM)-based RH, but also among different DGVMs, highlighting a better parameterizing of DGVMs, particularly the model output not validated by field observations, to better understand RH and belowground carbon dynamics.
