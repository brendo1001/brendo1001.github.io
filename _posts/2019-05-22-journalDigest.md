Abstract:
The soil-water retention curve (SWRC) at the dry end, also known as soil water vapor sorption isotherms, is essential for the modeling of water vapor transport, microbial activity, and biological processes such as plant water uptake in the vadose zone. Measurement of detailed soil water vapor sorption isotherms (WSIs) can be time consuming. Therefore, we propose rapid, inexpensive methodologies (visible-near-infrared spectroscopy [vis-NIRS] and a pedotransfer function [PTF]) to predict the Campbell-Shiozawa (CS) model parameters to obtain the WSIs. Water vapor sorption isotherms were measured on 144 soil samples with a vapor sorption analyzer. The CS semi-logarithmic-linear function anchored at a soil-water matric potential of -10(6) cm H2O (log vertical bar-10(6)vertical bar = pF(6)) was fitted to the measured data because it accurately characterizes the WSIs. Thereafter, a vis-NIRS calibration model and a PTF, based on clay and organic C contents, were developed and used to
  predict the two reference CS model parameters (a and W-6). Both parameters were predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy using vis-NIRS and the PTF (for a, RMSE values of 0.0041 and 0.0025, and for W-6, RMSE values of 0.0042 and 0.0034 for vis-NIRS and the PTF, respectively). Based on the predicted a and W-6 values, the predicted WSIs compared closely with the measured isotherms for individual soil samples from each field. At the field scale, the vis-NIRS model performed marginally better than the PTF. Thus, it is evident that the use of vis-NIRS or PTFs provides a relatively inexpensive approach to predicting soil water sorption isotherms.

Abstract:
There is a growing capability to project the impacts and economic effects of climate change across multiple sectors. This information is needed to inform decisions regarding the diversity and magnitude of future climate impacts and explore how mitigation and adaptation actions might affect these risks. Here, we summarize results from sectoral impact models applied within a consistent modelling framework to project how climate change will affect 22 impact sectors of the United States, including effects on human health, infrastructure and agriculture. The results show complex patterns of projected changes across the country, with damages in some sectors (for example, labour, extreme temperature mortality and coastal property) estimated to range in the hundreds of billions of US dollars annually by the end of the century under high emissions. Inclusion of a large number of sectors shows that there are no regions that escape some mix of adverse impacts. Lower emissions, and adapt
 ation in relevant sectors, would result in substantial economic benefits.
