The absorption of rain and irrigation water by soils, called the infiltration process, is of vital importance for plant growth. This process is controlled by the permeability properties of soils, and this paper presents new methods for determining these properties and new equations describing the infiltration process more precisely than in previous works. These contributions allow a better understanding of the infiltration process and more precise calculation of water infiltration rates under conditions imposed by both nature and irrigation practices.

Leading up to the Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of the Parties 15, there is momentum around setting bold conservation targets. Yet it remains unclear how much of Earth's land area remains without significant human influence. We compare four recent global maps of human influences (Anthromes, Global Human Modification, Human Footprint, and Low Impact Areas) and find that about half of Earth's terrestrial surface has relatively low human influence. These findings offer opportunities for proactive conservation actions to retain the last intact ecosystems on the planet, although the relative abundance of ecosystem areas with low human influence varies widely by biome.


### Distinct controls over the temporal dynamics of soil carbon fractions after land use change

Our understanding on the controls over soil organic carbon (SOC) composition, particularly its temporal dynamics, is quite limited, inhibiting reliable prediction of SOC dynamics. By assessing a comprehensive dataset including temporal measurements of three SOC fractions (i.e. particulate, mineral-associated and charred organic carbon) after land use change, we found that environmental factors present distinct effects on the dynamics of the three fractions, and these effects were time-dependent. To reduce uncertainties in SOC predictions in response to global change and land management, the distinct controls over the dynamics of SOC fractions should be properly considered in carbon models.
