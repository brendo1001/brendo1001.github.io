<h3 id="how-farmers-approach-soil-carbon-sequestration-lessons-learned-from-105-carbon-farming-plans">How farmers approach soil carbon sequestration? Lessons learned from 105 carbon-farming plans</h3>

<p>Soil carbon sequestration is a recognized climate mitigation method, but it involves changes in the practices of more than 0.5 billion farms worldwide. Regionally customized carbon-farming programs are one way to tailor soil carbon storage to local conditions. We conducted farmer participatory research on 105 Finnish farms to investigate how farmers approach carbon (C) sequestration. We conducted training for farmers in the basics of carbon-farming and instructed them to make a Carbon Farming Plan for one of their fields. The plans were evaluated by a team of experts and through soil C balance calculations. In addition, potential nutrient limitations and the existing C stock were identified from soil tests. Although the existing C stocks were relatively high, an assessment of the plans indicated high potential for additional C storage (median 320 kg C ha(-1)year(-1)). The plans did not show any sensitivity to the existing C stock, with similar C inputs planned for low organic matter (OM) and high OM soils. The farmers either did not know their C stock or were not familiar with the C balance concept. Most soil samples showed considerable nutrient deficiencies (P, S, B and Mn), which can limit C storage. The quality of most plans was adequate for research with minor modifications. The largest C storage potential was estimated for measures with large additions of nutrient-poor amendments or in grazing. Most farmers chose measures with relatively low C storage benefits but high potential benefits for soil structure and productivity (cover crops, nutrient-rich amendments, grassland management). The C gain from some measures (subsoiling, diversity in grasslands) could not be estimated with current methodologies. The magnitude of planned C storage over 5 years on most farms was so small (&lt;0.5% OM), that it is challenging to measure it through soil sampling. This finding supports the earlier conclusions that a combination of modeling and soil sampling is needed to verify the C storage.</p>

<h3 id="sequestration-of-soil-carbon-by-burying-it-deeper-within-the-profile-a-theoretical-exploration-of-three-possible-mechanisms">Sequestration of soil carbon by burying it deeper within the profile: A theoretical exploration of three possible mechanisms</h3>

<p>Subsoil carbon is generally older and decomposes more slowly than topsoil carbon. It has, therefore, been suggested that carbon stocks could be increased by burying carbon-rich topsoil at depth to slow its decomposition. This has been supported by recent experiments that showed that buried topsoil carbon indeed decomposed more slowly, but the mechanisms causing the reduction have not yet been identified. We investigated three theoretical mechanisms that may explain reduced decomposition rates at depth: (1) lower soil-temperature variability, (2) lower oxygen concentrations/redox potential and (3) less priming (biological synergy). Temperature variability decreases with soil depth. As decomposition rates vary non-linearly with temperature, reduced temperature variability should, therefore, reduce annual decomposition rates. However, detailed simulations showed that it changed annual decomposition rates by only a few percent. Maximal decomposition rates also require adequate oxygen, but our simulations showed that oxygen diffusion rates would need to be reduced 1000 to 10 000-fold compared to the topsoil for it to protect buried soil carbon. Oxygen limitation is, therefore, likely to be confined to soils that are water-logged for extended periods. Priming (or biological synergy) is assumed to be the stimulation of decomposition rates by the availability of labile organic carbon. Our simulations showed that lower labile carbon inputs could reduce priming and potentially preserve up to half of buried carbon for centuries. If experimental work can further substantiate the role of this mechanism, carbon burial at depth could become a practical and useful climate-change mitigation option.</p>

<h3 id="the-abuse-of-popular-performance-metrics-in-hydrologic-modeling">The Abuse of Popular Performance Metrics in Hydrologic Modeling</h3>

<p>The goal of this commentary is to critically evaluate the use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. We focus on the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics, which are both widely used in hydrologic research and practice around the world. Our specific objectives are: (a) to provide tools that quantify the sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics; (b) to quantify sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics across a large sample of catchments; and (c) to prescribe the further research that is, needed to improve the estimation, interpretation, and use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. Our large-sample analysis demonstrates that there is substantial sampling uncertainty in the NSE and KGE estimators. This occurs because the probability distribution of squared errors between model simulations and observations has heavy tails, meaning that performance metrics can be heavily influenced by just a few data points. Our results highlight obvious (yet ignored) abuses of performance metrics that contaminate the conclusions of many hydrologic modeling studies: It is essential to quantify the sampling uncertainty in performance metrics when justifying the use of a model for a specific purpose and when comparing the performance of competing models.</p>

<h3 id="soil-classification-a-new-approach-for-grouping-soils-using-unsaturated-hydraulic-conductivity-data">Soil Classification: A New Approach for Grouping Soils Using Unsaturated Hydraulic Conductivity Data</h3>

<p>Grouping soils based on similarities in their textural, taxonomic, and/or structural properties has broad applications to pedology, hydrology, and soil science. In this study, we present a new approach for classifying soils using hydraulic conductivity data. We apply concepts from critical path analysis and calculate critical pore sizes at various water saturations from the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves. Soils with similar critical pore size at the same effective water saturation are then grouped into the same class. To demonstrate the practical application of the proposed soil classification method, we use 102 samples including nine soil textures from the UNSODA database. Applying a curve clustering method, we find eight different soil classes within the studied data set.</p>

<h3 id="predicting-characteristics-of-the-water-cycle-from-scaling-relationships">Predicting Characteristics of the Water Cycle From Scaling Relationships</h3>

<p>Over multi-decadal time scales, assuming that changes in subsurface water storage are negligible, the continental precipitative water flux, P, can be divided into two principal components, Q (run-off, including soil infiltration and groundwater recharge) and ET (evapotranspiration). Taking into account a broadly applied Budyko’s phenomenology to describe the relationship of ET/P as a function of PET/P, where PET is the potential evapotranspiration, we propose a theoretical framework for predicting characteristics of the water cycle from scaling relationships. In this framework, the ecosystem net primary productivity is expressed in terms of soil formation and vegetation growth, which is mathematically optimized with respect to the water partitioning, generating directly the value ET/P. The mathematical optimization is based on the general ecological principle that dominant ecosystems tend to be those that, for any given conditions, maximize conversion of atmospheric carbon to biomass. It is shown that application of the results of mathematical optimization to water-limited ecosystems is possible by applying the optimization only to a vegetation covered portion of the surface. For energy-limited ecosystems, the optimization can be applied only to a portion of the precipitation equal to PET, assuming that the remaining P simply runs off. We use theoretical and actual values of plant root fractal dimensionalities, d(f), to predict ranges of ET/P as a function of PET/P for 0 &lt;= PET/P &lt;= 1 and compare with annual and multi-decadal means of ET/P. By comparing the developed approach with a large amount of data collected from the literature, we demonstrate its successful applications to both water- and energy-limited systems.</p>

<h3 id="a-transfer-function-to-predict-soil-surface-reflectance-from-laboratory-soil-spectral-libraries">A transfer function to predict soil surface reflectance from laboratory soil spectral libraries</h3>

<p>Spectral-based models extracted from laboratory reflectance in the 400-2500 nm spectral range to predict soil attributes may not be applicable to soil spectra acquired in the field. This is because laboratory sampling procedures disturb the natural soil surface’s status. We investigated this issue by using the soil surface-dependent property of water-infiltration rate (WIR). We created a dataset with 114 samples collected from six fields with varying textures located in three different Mediterranean countries (Israel, Greece, Italy). Using the field and laboratory spectral datasets, we demonstrated that WIR is better predicted by field vs. laboratory measurements (R-2 = 0.92 and 0.56, respectively). We also developed a transfer function (TF) to predict the field spectral measurements from the laboratory spectra. Use of the TF-processed dataset considerably improved the WIR prediction using laboratory information (from R-2 = 0.56 to 0.76). It was concluded that soil surface reflectance values can be estimated based on laboratory spectra using a TF. The generated TF enables exploiting soil spectral libraries for remote-sensing views and for assessing surface-related soil properties.</p>

<h3 id="using-carbonate-absorbance-peak-to-select-the-most-suitable-regression-model-before-predicting-soil-inorganic-carbon-concentration-by-mid-infrared-reflectance-spectroscopy">Using carbonate absorbance peak to select the most suitable regression model before predicting soil inorganic carbon concentration by mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Mid-Infrared reflectance spectroscopy (MIRS, 4000-400 cm(-1)) is being considered to provide accurate estimations of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) contents, based on prediction models when the test dataset is well represented by the calibration set, with similar SIC range and distribution and pedological context. This work addresses the case where the test dataset, here originating from France, is poorly represented by the calibration set, here originating from Tunisia, with different SIC distributions and pedological contexts. It aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of 1) classifying test samples according to SIC level based on the height of the carbonate absorbance peak at 2510 cm(-1), and then 2) selecting a suitable prediction model according to SIC level. Two regression methods were tested: Linear Regression using the height of the carbonate peak at 2510 cm(-)(1), called Peak-LR model; and Partial Least Squares Regression using the entire MIR spectrum, called Full-PLSR model. First, our results showed that Full-PLSR was 1) more accurate than Peak-LR on the Tunisian validation set (R-val(2) = 0.99 vs. 0.86 and RMSEval = 3.0 vs. 9.7 g kg(-1) , respectively), but 2) less accurate than Peak-LR when applied on the French dataset (R-test(2) = 0.70 vs. 0.91 and RMSEtest = 13.7 vs. 4.9 g kg(-1), respectively). Secondly, on the French dataset, predictions on SIC-poor samples tended to be more accurate using Peak-LR, while predictions on SIC-rich samples tended to be more accurate using Full-PLSR. Thirdly, the height of the carbonate absorbance peak at 2510 cm(-1) might be used to discriminate SIC-poor and SIC-rich test samples (&lt;5 vs. &gt; 5 g kg(-1)): when this height was &gt; 0, Full-PLSR was applied; otherwise Peak-LR was applied. Coupling Peak-LR and Full-PLSR models depending on the carbonate peak yielded the best predictions on the French dataset (R-test(2) = 0.95 and RMSEtest = 3.7 g kg(-1)). This study underlined the interest of using a carbonate peak to select suitable regression approach for predicting SIC content in a database with different distribution than the calibration database.</p>

<h3 id="monitoring-soil-organic-matter-on-grassland-farms-an-exploratory-analysis">Monitoring soil organic matter on grassland farms: An exploratory analysis</h3>

<p>To meet the goals of the Climate Agreement, policy makers consider incentivizing soil carbon sequestration by carbon credits to offset greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, industry and other sectors. Therefore, the interest in monitoring soil organic matter dynamics is growing rapidly, yet factors affecting the precision of the monitoring results are rarely quantified. We used the rhetorical scheme “The seven circumstances” to structure the methodological aspects of setting up a soil organic matter (SOM) monitoring program. The rhetorical scheme was applied during four years on two grass-based dairy farms in the Netherlands to assess in detail: conversion of SOM weight concentrations to SOM stocks (HOW), the effect of soil depth and the integration of scales field vs. farm (WHERE), and the effect of sampling date and sampling frequency on SOM estimates (WHEN). We found that all three circumstances affect conclusions on SOM stocks or SOM dynamics strongly. Considerable variation was found in the relationship between soil bulk density and SOM weight concentration (i.e. pedotransfer curves) among fields, depth and literature reference equations. Therefore, preferably a site specific pedotransfer curve should be used when comparing SOM stocks based on SOM weight concentrations across sites. Large differences in trends of SOM stock changes over time were found between fields and sampling depths. We conclude that a sampling depth in grassland soils up to 60 cm may be relevant to capture the dynamics in deeper layers. Furthermore, for quantitative underpinning of carbon payment schemes, the whole farm should be monitored rather than a few fields as trends between fields are highly variable.</p>

<h3 id="an-integrated-approach-for-the-evaluation-of-quantitative-soil-maps-through-taylor-and-solar-diagrams">An integrated approach for the evaluation of quantitative soil maps through Taylor and solar diagrams</h3>

<p>For many decades, soil scientists have produced spatial estimates of soil properties using statistical and non-statistical mapping models. Commonly in soil mapping studies the map quality is assessed through pairwise comparison of observed and predicted values of a soil property, from which statistical indices summarizing the quality of the entire map are computed. Often these indices are based on average error and correlation statistics. In this study, we recommend a more appropriate and effective method of map evaluation by means of Taylor and solar diagrams. Taylor and solar diagrams are summary diagrams exploiting the relationship between statistical indices to visualize differentiable aspects of map quality into a single plot. An important advantage over current map quality evaluation is that map quality can be assessed from the combined effect of a few statistical quantities, not just on the basis of a single index or list of indices. We illustrate the use of common statistical indices and their combination into summary diagrams with a simulation study and two applications on soil data. In the simulation study nine maps with known statistical properties are produced and evaluated with tables and summary diagrams. In the first case study with soil data, change in the quality of a large-scale topsoil organic carbon map is tracked for a number of permutations in the mapping model parameters, whereas in the second case study several maps of topsoil organic carbon content for the same area, made by various statistical and non-statistical models, are compared and evaluated. We consider that in all cases better insights in map quality are obtained with summary diagrams, instead of using a single index or an extensive list of indices. This underpins the importance of using integrated summary graphics to communicate on quantitative map quality so as to avoid excessive trust that a single map quality index may suggest.</p>

<h3 id="achieving-joint-calibration-of-soil-vis-nir-spectra-across-instruments-soil-types-and-properties-by-an-attention-based-spectra-encoding-spectraproperty-decoding-architecture">Achieving joint calibration of soil Vis-NIR spectra across instruments, soil types and properties by an attention-based spectra encoding-spectra/property decoding architecture</h3>

<p>Due to the differences in instruments and measurement methods, soil visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectral data collected worldwide cannot be combined to provide consistent calibration models, reducing the benefit of producing soil spectra libraries. We propose an attention-based spectra encoding-spectra/property decoding model for soil Vis-NIR spectral analysis to solve this problem. By introducing the attention mechanism, the model can use the same parameters to achieve a joint calibration regardless of the length of the input spectral data and the type of soil samples. The model design pays attention to wavelengths combination, which accords to the essence of Vis-NIR analysis. Three datasets, including the LUCAS, Brazilian, and Kenyan datasets, were used to train and test the attention model. An alternative convolution neural network (CNN) encoding architecture that allows joint calibration was also introduced. Comparing with conventional partial least squares regression (PLSR) and CNN encoding model, the present attention model obtained the best results on all three datasets. This is the first time that an attention-based model has been applied to soil Vis-NIR spectra analysis. The model can process spectra data with different sizes and focus on the relation between different wavelengths, providing a joint calibration. It has the potential to become a “one model for all” in soil Vis-NIR spectra research.</p>

<h3 id="bayesian-approach-for-sample-size-determination-illustrated-with-soil-health-card-data-of-andhra-pradesh-india">Bayesian approach for sample size determination, illustrated with Soil Health Card data of Andhra Pradesh (India)</h3>

<p>A crucial decision in designing a spatial sample for soil survey is the number of sampling locations required to answer, with sufficient accuracy and precision, the questions posed by decision makers at different levels of geographic aggregation. In the Indian Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, many thousands of locations are sampled per district. In this paper the SHC data are used to estimate the mean of a soil property within a defined study area, e.g., a district, or the areal fraction of the study area where some condition is satisfied, e.g., exceedence of a critical level. The central question is whether this large sample size is needed for this aim. The sample size required for a given maximum length of a confidence interval can be computed with formulas from classical sampling theory, using a prior estimate of the variance of the property of interest within the study area. Similarly, for the areal fraction a prior estimate of this fraction is required. In practice we are uncertain about these prior estimates, and our uncertainty is not accounted for in classical sample size determination (SSD). This deficiency can be overcome with a Bayesian approach, in which the prior estimate of the variance or areal fraction is replaced by a prior distribution. Once new data from the sample are available, this prior distribution is updated to a posterior distribution using Bayes’ rule. The apparent problem with a Bayesian approach prior to a sampling campaign is that the data are not yet available. This dilemma can be solved by computing, for a given sample size, the predictive distribution of the data, given a prior distribution on the population and design parameter. Thus we do not have a single vector with data values, but a finite or infinite set of possible data vectors. As a consequence, we have as many posterior distribution functions as we have data vectors. This leads to a probability distribution of lengths or coverages of Bayesian credible intervals, from which various criteria for SSD can be derived. Besides the fully Bayesian approach, a mixed Bayesian-likelihood approach for SSD is available. This is of interest when, after the data have been collected, we prefer to estimate the mean from these data only, using the frequentist approach, ignoring the prior distribution. The fully Bayesian and mixed Bayesian-likelihood approach are illustrated for estimating the mean of log-transformed Zn and the areal fraction with Zn-deficiency, defined as Zn concentration &lt;0.9 mg kg(-1), in the thirteen districts of Andhra Pradesh state. The SHC data from 2015-2017 are used to derive prior distributions. For all districts the Bayesian and mixed Bayesian-likelihood sample sizes are much smaller than the current sample sizes. The hyperparameters of the prior distributions have a strong effect on the sample sizes. We discuss methods to deal with this. Even at the mandal (sub-district) level the sample size can almost always be reduced substantially. Clearly SHC over-sampled, and here we show how to reduce the effort while still providing information required for decision-making. R scripts for SSD are provided as supplementary material.</p>

<h3 id="quantification-of-soil-organic-carbon-at-regional-scale-benefits-of-fusing-vis-nir-and-mir-diffuse-reflectance-data-are-greater-for-in-situ-than-for-laboratory-based-modelling-approaches">Quantification of soil organic carbon at regional scale: Benefits of fusing vis-NIR and MIR diffuse reflectance data are greater for in situ than for laboratory-based modelling approaches</h3>

<p>Benefits of fusion approaches for visible to near (vis-NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) chemometric modelling have been studied to some extent for laboratory-based soil studies, but little is known about the usefulness and limitations for in situ studies. Objectives were to compare laboratory-based and in situ vis-NIR and MIR partial least squares (PLS) and bagging-PLS regression approaches and to explore the potentials of combining both types of spectral data for the quantification of soil organic carbon (SOC). We applied different established low-level (spectra concatenation, outer product fusion approach) and high-level (averaging of vis-NIR and MIR modelling results) data fusion methods. The studied set comprised a total of 186 soil samples collected in SaxonyAnhalt and northern Saxony, Central Germany. One subset (Querfurt Plateau) covered 90 finely-textured soils originating from the Chernozem soil region, another (Diiben Heath) with 96 samples was characterized by a wider pedological variety. Vis-NIR and MIR diffuse reflectance spectra were measured in situ on the soil surface and in the laboratory on pre-treated (dried and finely ground) soil material with the ASD FieldSpec 4 and the Agilent 4300 Handheld FTIR instruments. We found a regionally stratified approach to be beneficial for accurate estimations for both laboratory and in situ data. For laboratory spectra, MIR outperformed vis-NIR data in both regions (Querfurt Plateau: r(2) = 0.85 vs. 0.65, RMSE = 0.11 (in % SOC) vs. 0.17; Diiben Heath: 0.77 vs. 0.69 (r(2)) and 0.27 vs. 0.40 (RMSE)). Ranking for in situ data was the same, but accuracies decreased markedly. With MIR, r(2) amounted to 0.58 and RMSE was 0.20 for the Querfurt Plateau (vis-NIR: r(2) = 0.26, RMSE = 0.27); for Diiben Heath, r(2) was 0.60 and RMSE was 0.39 for MIR data, while vis-NIR resulted in an r(2) of 0.53 and an RMSE of 0.43. For the studied samples, which had medium to low water contents (0.68 to 16.8 wt%, median at 5.4 wt%), we found accuracies with both spectral datasets to be similarly affected by in situ conditions. Model ensemble averaging based on bagging-PLS regression was the most efficient approach to improve SOC estimation accuracies with in situ spectral data, whereas model averaging was in general of little effect for laboratory data. Improvements were most marked for the in situ data of the Diiben Heath region, where r(2) increased to a value of 0.77 and RMSE decreased to 0.28. Low-level data fusion methods did not yield any improvements compared to model ensemble averaging. For the latter, we identified averaging with weights derived sample-wise from uncertainties in the bootstrap-based modelling as being most accurate, but with little benefits compared to a simple (unweighted) averaging of vis-NIR and MIR estimates. Our results suggest that already a simple averaging procedure has the potential to advance multi-sensor applications integrating vis-NIR and MIR data for in situ or on-site soil spectroscopy. This applies especially to regions with heterogeneous soil conditions, tied to spectral variablity, as this increases the probability of complementary vis-NIR and MIR information and their prospective fusion.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of using changes in environmental conditions to explain the spatiotemporal variability in soil organic carbon (SOC) with digital soil mapping (DSM) requires investigation. In this study, temporal variables representing temporal patterns of climate, vegetation, and land cover factors were explored. Models to predict SOC stocks were developed using a random forest algorithm and data from China during two periods (the 1980s and 2010s). We forecasted and hindcasted the developed models and assessed their temporal projections against temporally independent data. Models were developed for both periods using different sets of variables (with/without temporal variables), and their temporal projections were compared. The important temporal variables were identified by applying the recursive feature elimination algorithm. The results showed that the performances of temporal projections for the 1980s and 2010s were improved by approximately 17% and 47%, respectively, when temporal variables were included in the models. Spatially, the maps of changes in SOC stocks derived from the models that included temporal variables presented stronger associations with temporal changes in climate, vegetation, and land cover than those derived from the models that did not include temporal variables. This work highlights that variation in SOC stocks can be linked to temporal patterns of environmental factors. The findings also provide evidence that the application of temporal patterns of environmental factors to DSM models can be useful for the large-scale prediction of changes in SOC.</p>

<h3 id="statistical-inference-for-trends-in-spatiotemporal-data">Statistical inference for trends in spatiotemporal data</h3>

<p>Global change analyses are facilitated by the growing number of remote-sensing datasets that have both broad spatial extent and repeated observations over decades. These datasets provide unprecedented power to detect patterns of time trends involving information from all pixels on a map. However, rigorously testing for time trends requires a solid statistical foundation to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses. Appropriate statistical analyses are challenging because environmental data often have temporal and spatial autocorrelation, which can either obscure underlying patterns in the data or suggest false associations between patterns in the data and independent values used to explain them. Existing statistical methods that account for temporal and spatial autocorrelation are not practical for remote-sensing datasets that often contain millions of pixels. Here, we first analyze simulated data to show the need to account for both spatial and temporal autocorrelation in time-trend analyses. Second, we present a new statistical approach, PARTS (Partitioned Autoregressive Time Series), to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses about time trends using all pixels in large remotesensing datasets. PARTS is flexible and can include, for example, the effects of multiple independent variables, such as land-cover or latitude, on time trends. Third, we use PARTS to analyze global trends in NDVI, focusing on trends in pixels that have not experienced land-cover change. We found that despite the appearance of overall increases in NDVI in all continents, there is little statistical support for these trends except for Asia and Europe, and only in some land-cover classes. Furthermore, we found no overall latitudinal trend in greening for any continent, but some latitude by land-cover class interactions, implying that latitudinal patterns differed among land-cover classes. PARTS makes it possible to identify patterns and test hypotheses that involve the aggregate information from many pixels on a map, thereby increasing the value of existing remote-sensing datasets.</p>
