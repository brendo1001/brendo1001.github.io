<h3 id="a-tdr-wireless-device-for-volumetric-water-content-sensing">A TDR wireless device for volumetric water content sensing</h3>

<p>Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is a widely used technique to estimate the soil volumetric water content (theta) and bulk electrical conductivity (sigma). This paper presents TDR-WiFi, a wireless, portable and low cost interface to ease sensing of theta and sigma by connecting TDR cable tester with a smartphone. TDR-WiFi consists of a microprocessor equipped with a WiFi microcontroller (M5Stack unit) and connected to the TDR device through an RS232-TTL adapter. The M5stack firmware is programmed in MicroPython language to act as a server between the user and the TDR device through a web page accessible from any smartphone web browser. TDR-WiFi is compatible with the Campbell TDR100 device and allows storing the TDR waveforms as well as estimating theta and sigma. A complementary web page for subsequent analysis of the TDR waveforms was developed and is publicly available at http://swi.csic.es/tdrwifi/. The system was satisfactorily demonstrated in laboratory and tested in the field. The field trial allowed water content measurements in a steep road slope. TDR-WiFi demonstrated to be operative in the field and it can be satisfactorily used in difficult access areas.</p>

<h3 id="ecotrons-powerful-and-versatile-ecosystem-analysers-for-ecology-agronomy-and-environmental-science">Ecotrons: Powerful and versatile ecosystem analysers for ecology, agronomy and environmental science</h3>

<p>Ecosystems integrity and services are threatened by anthropogenic global changes. Mitigating and adapting to these changes require knowledge of ecosystem functioning in the expected novel environments, informed in large part through experimentation and modelling. This paper describes 13 advanced controlled environment facilities for experimental ecosystem studies, herein termed ecotrons, open to the international community. Ecotrons enable simulation of a wide range of natural environmental conditions in replicated and independent experimental units while measuring various ecosystem processes. This capacity to realistically control ecosystem environments is used to emulate a variety of climatic scenarios and soil conditions, in natural sunlight or through broad-spectrum lighting. The use of large ecosystem samples, intact or reconstructed, minimizes border effects and increases biological and physical complexity. Measurements of concentrations of greenhouse trace gases as well as their net exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere are performed in most ecotrons, often quasi continuously. The flow of matter is often tracked with the use of stable isotope tracers of carbon and other elements. Equipment is available for measurements of soil water status as well as root and canopy growth. The experiments ran so far emphasize the diversity of the hosted research. Half of them concern global changes, often with a manipulation of more than one driver. About a quarter deal with the impact of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and one quarter with ecosystem or plant physiology. We discuss how the methodology for environmental simulation and process measurements, especially in soil, can be improved and stress the need to establish stronger links with modelling in future projects. These developments will enable further improvements in mechanistic understanding and predictive capacity of ecotron research which will play, in complementarity with field experimentation and monitoring, a crucial role in exploring the ecosystem consequences of environmental changes.</p>

<h3 id="age-and-origin-of-the-cumberland-inner-sydney-basin-of-southeast-australia">Age and origin of the Cumberland (Inner Sydney) Basin of southeast Australia</h3>

<p>The Cumberland Basin is a structural and topographic low within the sedimentary Sydney Basin of southeast Australia. To the west, the Blue Mountains Plateau was uplifted along the north-south Lapstone Structural Complex after around 90 Ma, with uplift largely completed by middle Miocene to Pliocene times. To the north, upwarping of the Hornsby Plateau preceded the major phase of movement along the Lapstone Structural Complex. To the south, the topography of the Cumberland Basin is closely related to the form of the Camden Syncline. This appears to have been active in the late Permian-Middle Triassic. The western limb of the syncline is truncated by the north-south Lapstone Structural Complex. The southern part of the Cumberland Basin must therefore have taken on its modern form prior to the movements that gave rise to its western margin. The eastern side of the Cumberland Basin forms a broad depression open to the sea. This may be a graben-like structure developed along the Lachlan Transverse Zone. The Botany Basin, which may have begun subsiding at least as far back as the Oligocene, lies within this feature, suggesting that this part of the Cumberland Basin may have already been in existence at this stage. Within the broader Cumberland Basin, the Penrith and Botany basins appear to have begun subsiding early in the Cenozoic, accumulating complex and interrupted records of alluvial sediments in the former and eolian, shallow marine and alluvial sediments in the latter. Over this period, the Penrith and Botany basins seem to have acted as the focus of drainage across the Cumberland Basin, explaining the enigmatic pattern of rivers across the region. The Cumberland Basin’s margins thus formed in different ways and at different times, with the margin-forming processes perhaps associated with the volcanicity and tectonic movements accompanying the uplift of Australia’s Eastern Highlands in the period 80-10 Ma.</p>

<h3 id="uncertainty-analysis-of-eleven-multisource-soil-moisture-products-in-the-third-pole-environment-based-on-the-three-corned-hat-method">Uncertainty analysis of eleven multisource soil moisture products in the third pole environment based on the three-corned hat method</h3>

<p>Soil moisture (SM) is a fundamental environmental variable for characterizing climate, land surface and atmosphere. In recent years, several SM products have been developed based on remote sensing (RS), land surface model (LSM) or land data assimilation system (LDAS). However, little knowledge is available in understanding spatial patterns of the uncertainty of different SM products and potential regional drivers over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a complex environment for accurate SM estimation. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the SM uncertainties based on the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and a generalized additive model (GAM) in terms of underlying surface characteristics (sand fraction, soil organic matter, vegetation, land surface temperature, and topography) and near-ground meteorology (precipitation and air temperature) in the third pole environment over the 2015-2018 period. Eleven SM products are involved in this work, including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Land Surface Parameter Model (LPRM), Climate Change Initiative - Active/Combined (CCI_A/CCI_C), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model product a/b (GLEAM_a/GLEAM_b), and Random Forest Soil Moisture (RFSM). Results show that most of the SM products perform well across QTP, while SMOS-IC is strongly affected by radio-frequency interference in this region, JAXA has a relatively higher noise level over QTP, and LPRM has larger relative uncertainties (RUs) in the southeast of QTP. Nonlinear regression analysis demonstrates that variations of RUs in SMOS-IC and JAXA are driven by topography, while LPRM’s are mainly controlled by vegetation. In addition, two groups of opposite (positive/negative) effects from topography and vegetation, topography and precipitation, and precipitation and land surface temperature affect the spatial variations of RUs in CCI_A, RFSM, and ERA-Interim, respectively. Meanwhile, more complex relationships are found between multiple surface factors and RUs of different products. In general, the underlying surface factors explain on average 39.41% and 28.34% of the variations in RS and LSM/LDAS SM RUs, respectively. Comparatively, the near-ground meteorology factors have a slightly larger effect on LSM/LDAS products than that on RS products.</p>

<h3 id="a-d-vine-copula-quantile-regression-approach-for-soil-moisture-retrieval-from-dual-polarimetric-sar-sentinel-1-over-vegetated-terrains">A D-vine copula quantile regression approach for soil moisture retrieval from dual polarimetric SAR Sentinel-1 over vegetated terrains</h3>

<p>Soil moisture retrieval from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) over vegetated terrains requires an isolation of soil and canopy signals from observed backscatter (sigma degrees). This study develops a probabilistic soil moisture retrieval method from dual polarimetric C-band SAR Sentinel-1 (S-1) with uncertainty quantification at distinct vegetation covers (VCs). Both sigma(VV)degrees and sigma(VH)degrees were used to represent ground and volume scattering due to the high respective sensitivity to soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. A novel D-vine copula quantile regression (DVQR) was adopted to provide the soil moisture estimates based on modelling trivariate dependence of sigma(VV)degrees-sigma(VH)degrees -soil moisture anomalies (VV-VH-Mv), with a support from the innovative cosmic-ray soil moisture as ground-truth data. The feasibility of DVQR was underlined for: (1) multivariate nonlinear dependence structure modelling and (2) soil moisture retrieval with associated uncertainty. An inter-dependence analysis, which assesses the correlations among three major variables, indicated that the dependence between each pair of variables decreased as canopy density increases from herbs to forests, mainly due to the ci degrees attenuated by vegetation effect. The dependence structures simulated from the D-vine copula revealed highly nonlinear and asymmetric shapes with tail dependences occurred in most VCs, which can be well captured by different associated Archimedean copulas. Soil moisture anomaly (Mv) estimated using the DVQR and Multiple linear quantile regression (MLQR) were compared against ground-truth data for both in-sample and out-of-sample predictions. Superior performances of the DVQR in most VCs, with 10% and 16% improved in RMSE at grasslands and broadleaf forests, respectively, demonstrated the robustness of this method for S-1 soil moisture retrieval due to the highly nonlinear dependence structures captured by the D-vine models. Over VCs, better performances were obtained at low-canopy herbaceous regions (grasslands and croplands); whereas extremely dry conditions and complex structures in shrublands and dense forests resulted in inferior performances. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to evaluate the change in My estimation accuracy given distinct VV and VH quantile levels. Result underlines that VV is the primary factor controlling the retrieval accuracy, but the increase in VH level also contributes to higher errors in soil moisture estimation, especially under wet conditions.</p>
